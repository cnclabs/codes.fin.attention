overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of medications for the treatment of severe psychiatric and neurological diseases 
since our inception in may  we have been developing our lead product  corlux  targeted for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic major depression  or pmd  under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd 
we have completed the analysis of our first two large  double blind trials  and  in september and october  we initiated two phase clinical trials in the united states to support a planned new drug application  or nda 
five european clinical sites were added to one of these trials in march we expect that when enrollment in this trial is completed  these sites will continue to enroll patients for the other trial 
both of these trials are covered by special protocol assessments  or spas  from the fda 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we initiated a third phase clinical trial in europe and a clinical study in the united states to evaluate the safety and tolerability of retreatment with corlux 
we initiated an additional retreatment study in europe in august in october  we announced that we had signed an agreement with eli lilly and company  or lilly  in which lilly has agreed to support our proof of concept clinical study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of olanzapine 
this study will be conducted with healthy male volunteers 
in september  we closed enrollment in our phase clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux in improving cognition in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
the study was originally designed to enroll patients but was closed to further enrollment when patients had been enrolled 
the study was not powered to show statistically significant results with patients 
analysis of the data demonstrated that no discernable change in cognition occurred in the corlux treated patients 
review of the safety data from the trial revealed no serious safety findings 
a post hoc analysis identified weight reduction in obese patients as a possible effect of corlux treatment 

table of contents our activities to date have included product development  designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and intellectual property prosecution and expansion 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us 
we are in the development stage and have incurred significant losses since our inception because we have not generated any revenue  and do not expect to generate any revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for corlux  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next two years as we complete our corlux clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  expand development of gr ii antagonists for new indications  acquire and develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our corlux clinical trials  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 
results of operations research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities including non cash stock based compensation  as well as the costs of discovery research  pre clinical studies  clinical trial preparations  enrollment and monitoring expenses  regulatory costs and the costs of manufacturing development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in yearly expenses reflects clinical trial cost increases of million primarily related to phase clinical trial expenses for pmd 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in of approximately million in expenses for our discovery research program due to the successful conclusion of a program focusing on the discovery of new chemical entities that will be available for future development 
in addition  during the year ended december  as compared to  decreases in production and testing of clinical supplies and manufacturing development of approximately  and stock based compensation of approximately  were offset by increases in pre clinical studies  clinical consulting and infrastructure costs of approximately   and  respectively 
research and development expenses discussed above for the year ended december  included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately  as compared with charges of approximately  for the year ended december  in addition  during the years ended december  and  upon the termination of employees or the change in status of employees who worked in a development function to consultants  we recorded reversals of approximately  and  respectively  of previously reported stock based compensation expense  which represents the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the service of these individuals as employees 
for a discussion of the estimated impact of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas r  as of january   see discussion below under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the year over year increase in our research and development activities included a net increase of approximately  in the costs of clinical trials  an increase of approximately  in expenses for 
table of contents pre clinical studies  an increase of approximately  for the production and testing of clinical supplies  an increase of approximately  in the discovery research program  and an increase of approximately  in support costs  such as consultants  product liability insurance  travel and facilities  as compared with the increase in clinical trial costs reflects a net increase in clinical trial expenses for pmd of approximately  as the expenses associated with the commencement of various clinical trials  including the phase trials discussed above and other pmd related trials more than offset the reduction in costs due to the completion of a double blind pmd clinical trial in late and a decrease of approximately  in the costs of the alzheimer s disease trial 
salaries and benefits for research and development increased by approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to the hiring of additional staff in these areas 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately  in stock compensation expense 
the decrease in stock compensation expense includes a reduction of approximately  in the amortization of non cash stock based deferred compensation due to the decelerating scale of expense recognition under the graded vesting method and expense reversals of approximately  recorded during  upon an employee termination and the change in status of a research employee to a consultant 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd corlux for the treatment of mild to moderate alzheimer s disease drug discovery research stock based compensation total research and development expense we expect that research and development expenditures will increase substantially in and in subsequent years due to the continuation and expansion of the clinical development of corlux for pmd  the initiation of trials of corlux to evaluate its use in other indications  commercialization planning for corlux and additional study expenditures for new gr ii antagonists and other pharmaceutical candidates 
these increases will be partially offset by savings from the cessation of enrollment in the alzheimer s study that was announced in september many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
in addition  the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  decreases in stock based compensation of approximately  and legal expenses of  were partially offset by increases in professional fees  insurance  market research and staffing of approximately    and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately  as compared with approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the decelerating scale of expense recognition under the graded vesting method 
see discussion below under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation for a discussion of the estimated impact of the implementation of sfas r  as of january  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable  in part  to an increase in non cash stock based compensation of million 
in addition  there were increases in staffing costs of  insurance costs of  and patent  legal and professional fees of  due to increased intellectual property activities and increased costs related to 
table of contents being a public company 
the increase in stock based compensation between years is largely due to an expense reversal during of million of stock based compensation expense that we recorded upon the termination of an employee and the reduction in service of a director  which represents the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the vesting of the related options 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase during and in subsequent years due to additional personnel  higher support costs for our commercialization efforts  costs associated with the growth in our market research activities  and expanded operating infrastructure 
an increase in general and administrative expenses is also expected to accompany our infrastructure growth associated with our public company reporting activities 
non operating income  net interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to higher yields on the investment portfolios during as compared to  which were partially offset by decreased earnings due to lower average balance of invested funds 
interest and other income  net  increased to approximately  for the year ended december   from approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to higher average cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances during  due to the investment of the net proceeds from the initial public offering  or ipo  in april other expense 
other expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the expense in represents state tax and interest expense on capitalized leases entered into during the year 
the expense in included state tax and interest expense on our convertible note payable to the institute for the study of aging 
the note was converted into common stock in june other expense increased to approximately  in the year ended december   from approximately  for the year ended december  state tax expense  which is based in part on the amount of assets on the balance sheet  increased by approximately  due to the increase in assets generated by the ipo 
this was offset by a  decrease in interest expense on our convertible note payable to the institute for the study of aging  which was converted into common stock on june  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments balances of million  compared to million at december  and cash and cash equivalents of million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of net losses associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure 
the increase in cash used in operating activities during was due to the expansion of our development program in pmd  as well as our general and administrative infrastructure 
we expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase during and later years due to the continuation and expansion of our development program for pmd  research activities and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances and interest thereon  will be sufficient to enable us to complete the clinical development  as currently planned  of corlux  for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd  and to satisfy our other anticipated cash needs for operating expenses at least through however  we cannot be certain that additional funding will not be required or desirable during this period and  if so  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or products  including potentially our lead product  that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents our estimates of obligations under contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands research and development studies operating lease capital leases minimum royalty payments per year total   per year amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  during and  we executed a number of agreements to conduct clinical trials and pre clinical studies for further development of our lead product  corlux  targeted for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd 
the agreements provide for termination by us upon forty five days written notice or less 
the exact amounts and timing of these obligations are dependent on the pace of activities of the various trials and studies 
certain of the agreements discussed in footnotes above and below relate to trials to be conducted in europe 
the contractual agreements for these trials are denominated in euros  which are converted to us dollars at the time of invoicing 
the remaining obligations under these agreements are subject to fluctuation based on the changes in the currency rates 
see discussion under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in november  we signed an agreement for the performance of testing services in connection with a cardiac study to be performed in the total commitment under this agreement of approximately million is included in the table above 
a separate agreement was signed in january with a contract research organization cro to assist in the conduct of this study for an additional commitment of approximately million 
this obligation is not included in the table above as the agreement had not been executed as of december  in december  we signed an agreement with an academic research organization to assist in the conduct of a weight gain mitigation study to be performed in the total commitment under this agreement is approximately  the costs of this study will be reimbursed to us under a collaboration agreement with lilly that was signed in october our operating lease commitment relates to the lease of our office facility 
during  we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of certain pieces of office furniture and equipment 
under our cancelable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses from stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
in march  we signed an amendment to our agreement with the cro that assists us in the conduct of european clinical trial activities  to add five european sites to our us based phase trials 
the preparatory work for this effort had begun in late under a letter of intent with the cro 
the total commitment under this amendment is approximately  euros  approximately  based on the conversion rate at the time of signing  of which approximately  had been committed previously under the letter of intent 
in addition  approximately  of this commitment relates to per patient costs that will replace amounts included in the table and footnotes above  regarding commitments with the cros that are enrolling patients at the sites in the united states 
the net amount of the incremental commitment related to this amendment is approximately  since the agreement was not signed until  this amount is not included in the table 
we also have other contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with pmd and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering the licensed product and  upon fda approval of the licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
in addition  our agreement with scinopharm taiwan that provides for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for corlux includes a minimum purchase commitment of  per year following the commercial launch of corlux 

table of contents net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in federal research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as approximately million of california net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in california research and development tax credit carryforwards  available to offset any future taxable income we may generate 
the federal and california net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized in any particular year if certain changes in our ownership occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accruals of research and development costs 
we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately million and  as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation for options 
stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors for all accounting periods from inception through december   we accounted for stock option grants to employees under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles boards opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  we recorded deferred stock based compensation related to option grants to employees and directors that represents the difference  if any  between the exercise price of an option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the time of our ipo in april  management was required to estimate the fair value of our common stock based on a variety of company and industry specific factors for the purpose of measuring the cost of the transaction and properly reflecting it in our financial statements 
since our ipo  all stock options have been granted at exercise prices that represent the closing price for the stock on the nasdaq stock market as of the date of grant 
deferred compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally five years 
our policy has been to use the graded vesting method for recognizing compensation costs for fixed employee awards for all awards granted through december  we amortize the deferred stock based compensation of employee options on the graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the applicable stock options 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater vesting in earlier years than the straight line method 
upon termination of employment  the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the vesting of the related option is required to be reversed 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense  net of reversals  related to option grants to employees and directors of approximately  million and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts included amortization of deferred compensation for options granted to employees of approximately  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  
table of contents we recorded expense reversals of  and million  respectively  related to terminations during those years 
in addition  during and  upon the change in status of employees to consultancy status  we recorded expense reversals of approximately  and  respectively  which represents the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individuals service as employees 
certain of the options previously granted to these individuals will continue to vest as the consultants provide services to us 
the fair value of options to be vested and earned after the employees change in status will be charged to expense as such options are earned over the remaining vesting periods using the straight line method 
as of december   we had remaining employee deferred stock based compensation of approximately  that relates to options granted prior to our ipo 
no deferred compensation was recorded for options issued after our ipo as the exercise price of these option grants was equal to the stock price on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally would require  instead  that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
in accordance with sfas r  companies will be required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we are required to adopt sfas r as of january  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have adopted sfas r as of january  under the modified prospective method 
following is a brief synopsis of the implications of adoption of this statement on our accounting practices in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors options granted prior to january  for options granted prior to the ipo in  we will continue to account for the portion of these grants that were unvested as of january  under the provisions of apb  with pro forma disclosures under sfas this treatment is being followed because we had used the minimum value method for these options under sfas pro forma disclosure requirements 
for the options granted after the ipo  we will begin as of january  to record non cash stock compensation expense in the financial statements in amounts that represent the remaining fair value of the unvested portion of these grants  utilizing the assumptions and fair value per share as of the original grant date that we have been using for sfas pro forma disclosure purposes 
for all options granted prior to january   we will continue to utilize the graded vesting method for amortization of the relevant compensation amounts 
since we have a limited employee base  we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 

table of contents options granted on or after january  compensation expense will be recorded in the financial statements based on the fair value on the date of grant  in accordance with the provisions and guidelines of sfas r and all relevant interpretations and sec staff accounting bulletins 
the grant date fair value for all new grants will be amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
since we have a limited employee base  at this time we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded under the straight line method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
the table below provides an estimate of the amounts that we will record as operating expense in our statement of operations for the year ending december   based on the unvested portion of options granted prior to the january  there will be no impact on our financial condition or cash flow or as these charges are all non cash amounts 
it should be noted that the amounts actually recorded during may differ from the figures presented in this table due to the issuance of any new grants or employee terminations during operating expense category amounts in thousands research and development general and administrative total non employees stock based compensation related to option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  based on the fair value of the options using the black sholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the sfas disclosures for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is remeasured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq stock market 
we recognized stock based compensation expense related to option grants to non employees of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards see discussion above under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation regarding the adoption of sfas r in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions  and the short term and long term investments consist of corporate debt securities and us government obligations 
to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december  in  we signed a master agreement with a cro to assist us in the conduct of clinical trials in europe 
the costs of these trials are denominated in euros  which the vendor converts into us dollars for invoicing as costs are incurred  generally on a monthly basis 
thus  we may bear some currency rate exposure for the costs of these trials 
as of december   we had executed amendments to this agreement that included euro denominated commitments of approximately million euros  of which approximately million euros had not been expended or accrued as of december  the unexpended euro 
table of contents amount as of december  is equivalent to approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
in march  we signed an additional amendment to our agreement with this cro to add five european sites to our us based phase trials 
the preparatory work for this effort had begun in late under a letter of intent with the cro 
the total commitment under this amendment is approximately  euros  approximately  based on the conversion rate at the time of signing  of which approximately   euros had been committed previously under the letter of intent 
a increase or decrease in the currency rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro would have an impact of approximately  on the unexpended cost of these trials 
these trials are expected to be conducted through the first half of the timing of payments for these trials will depend upon various factors including the pace of site selection  patient enrollment  and other trial activities 
the master agreement with this cro provides for termination by us with forty five days notice
