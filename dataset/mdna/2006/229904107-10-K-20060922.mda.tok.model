in spite of the lackluster economy during the last four years in europe  the french subsidiary reported profitable results and double digit growth in the on board service channel in france 
however  in fiscal  the growth in the on board service channel was offset by the decline in demand in the foodservice channel due to political demonstrations and strikes in france that affected the hospitality industry during early february to early april as well as reduced poultry consumption due to initial scares of an avian flu outbreak in europe during the third quarter of fiscal impact of inflation and the economy inflation in labor and ingredient costs can significantly affect the company s operations 
in fiscal  many of the company s employees were paid hourly rates related to  but generally higher than the federal minimum rates 
the company s sales pricing structure allows for the fluctuation of raw material prices and fuel costs 
as a result  market price variations do not significantly affect the gross margin realized on product sales 
however  most customers require a sixty day notice for price changes in order to update their internal systems and evaluate the impact of price changes 
therefore  in the event of a continuous commodity price increase  the company must either absorb the price increase during that sixty day period or discontinue sales to the customer  and risk losing the long term business relationship

future prospects during fiscal year  the company continued its focus on the existing sales channels obtaining further penetration into the airline industry  obtaining a large portion of the market share of the passenger rail market  and gaining a larger share of the hotel and convention center restaurant  room service  and banquet business 
the company also focused on expanding as a retail supplier via the in store deli market as well as supplier of cuisine solutions premium frozen food products 
there was also growth in the national restaurant chain and military channels 
the company s objective is to further diversify into the five channels so if there is a disruption in one or more channels  the company will not be as significantly affected as it was after the september  tragedy when the on board services and foodservice channels were negatively impacted 
in fiscal  the company intends to continue increased focus on the cuisine solutions brand in retail  as well as major national restaurant chain  and food service accounts 
the company also sees growth in the travel industry and the military channels to achieve and continue the diversification strategy of the company  which was primarily the hospitality and travel industry in the past 
although there was significant growth in fiscal  the company believes that it has substantial growth opportunities to acquire additional business in what the company considers a maturing market for its products 
the company expects growing demand for its products as consumers continue to require convenience and quality and many operators either lack or cannot afford to pay the skilled workers necessary to supply the variety and quantity of food products demanded by their customers 
the goal of the company is to be the preeminent company in the upscale fully cooked frozen food category as this category develops 
on board services the company will continue to expand its sales efforts in the airline business in fiscal by continuing to market for new us accounts and also continue the focus on the european airline market 
while there are increased concerns regarding the financial health of airlines and trains in the us  management will seek to strengthen the business relationships with the major airlines  passenger rail lines and harbor and major cruise lines through continued value and an increase in service by offering flexible solutions based upon the demand in the industry 
foodservice in fiscal  the company will continue to focus its efforts on large foodservice contractors and event planners rather than sales to individual smaller hotels 
demand for foodservice products in france declined slightly in fiscal due to demonstrations  strikes  and bird flu scares 
however  the company expects growth in fiscal due to the continued customer satisfaction with the quality and variety of products offered by cuisine solutions 
customers in the foodservice sales channel place high value on the labor savings  quality  consistency  and food safety associated with our products 
management believes this value increases in the current economic and political situation challenging today s business environment 
the company intends to focus on large corporate accounts and explore new distribution methods in fiscal to improve its ability to more broadly distribute its products in this channel 
retail the retail sales channel was formally created during fiscal year with the objective of penetrating the in store deli category of major north american retailers 
although deli items in the supermarket is still an important part of the retail channel  the company focus for fiscal is to build the cuisine solutions brand in the warehouse stores  premium supermarkets  and natural stores 
the company sells primarily private label products in the retail market in france  and it will continue in fiscal  but it is the goal of the company to begin to work toward cuisine solutions branded frozen products in france 
in fiscal year  the company s retail sales program showed significant growth in the us  particularly with the club retailers  and it is allowing the company to capture certain of the high volume benefits of us retail without incurring significant costs of marketing investment as are usually required of food suppliers doing business with us retailers 
cuisine solutions believes that it is also beginning to gain brand awareness from its premium frozen foods sales 
cuisine solutions expects to continue to introduce new product offerings to the retail channel in fiscal building the cuisine solutions brand will be extremely important in fiscal the company anticipates strong growth again in this channel in fiscal military the us military channel continued to be managed via a broker distributor for the navy  adding very little in terms of sales and administrative expenses 
sales in this channel for fiscal grew with the navy  but the company s goal was to increase product penetration to other parts of the over billion annual us military food budget 
the company had been working for years to place items into the army unitized group rations a ugr a program 
cuisine solutions items were tested and selected for a entr e rotating menu that started in october  a cuisine solutions entr e was also selected for a thirty day cycle menu overseas called the concept of operations conops menu 
items on these two menus have contributed to significant growth in this channel the last two fiscal years 
there is no guarantee that the army will continue to purchase the items from the company  but the company s items are included in scheduled ugr a menus which started in early fiscal and the conops menu which started in early fiscal the company will also attempt to have its product included on more us military menus during fiscal and future years 
the company cannot anticipate the length of time that us troops will remain in the war zones where the current menus are operational 
the company still anticipates growth in this channel for fiscal national restaurant chains in fiscal  the company intends to further pursue its role as a supplier for national restaurant chains 
we believe that we have found that the company can provide products to fill out a restaurant chain s menu  it can also provide the specials for their seasonal menus  and it can solve a chain s smaller kitchen issues with our fully cooked products 
the company experienced significant sales growth in this channel in fiscal and management believes that there is a large untapped market for our upscale fully cooked products for the same reasons such products are appealing to the hotel and resort restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are interest rates  foreign exchange rates and sales and marketing 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its debt portfolio 
a portion of the debt portfolio has fluctuating interest rates that change with changes in the market 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure operations in france constitute of fiscal year company sales 
the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars  thereby limiting the company s risk to changes in foreign currency rates 
the functional currency in france is the euro 
fluctuation in the us dollar euro exchange rate impacts the translation of the income statements of the company s french operations into us dollars and affects year over year comparability of the company s operating results 
sales that are subject to these foreign currency fluctuations are approximately of the company s sales 
the assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries constitute approximately of the company s consolidated total assets and fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate similarly impact the translation of the value of these assets into us dollars 
the company does not enter into hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the company currently does not believe that this is justified by the potential exposure of the costs associated with derivative securities 
information about the company s foreign currency translation policy is set forth in note to the notes to the company s audited consolidated financial statements contained in this form k
