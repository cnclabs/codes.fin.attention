critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company normally recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods or delivery of the service to customers when collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the goods are received by the customer or upon installation and customer acceptance based on the terms of the sale agreement 
during  the company adopted the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of revenue recognition on contracts with multiple deliverable elements 
the adoption of eitf required the deferral of all revenue on a million project in process at december  until  at which time approximately million was recognized with the remaining revenue recognized during the company permits product returns from customers under certain circumstances and also allows returns under the company s warranty policy 
allowances for product returns are estimated and recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
the return allowance is recorded as a reduction to revenues for the estimated sales value of the projected returns and as a reduction in cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the company s revenue recognition policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company makes judgments about the credit worthiness of both current and prospective customers based on ongoing credit evaluations performed by the company s credit department 
these evaluations include  but are not limited to  reviewing customers prior payment history  analyzing credit applications  monitoring the aging of receivables from current customers and reviewing financial statements  if applicable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is developed based on several factors including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience and a specific account analysis that project the ultimate collectibility of the accounts 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
when it is determined that a customer is unlikely to pay  a charge is recorded to bad debt expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the allowance for doubtful accounts is increased 
when it becomes certain the customer cannot pay  the receivable is written off by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non payments 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or if one of the company s large customers were to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and overhead 
the company s policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable values are management s estimates related to the company s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand and the development of digital technology  which could make the company s theatre products obsolete  among other items 
management has managed these risks in the past and believes that it can manage them in the future  however  operating margins may suffer if they are unable to effectively manage these risks 
at december  the company had recorded gross inventory of approximately million and million of inventory reserves 
this compared to million and million  respectively  at december  warranty the company s products must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
in addition to known claims or warranty issues  the company estimates future claims on recent sales 
the company relies on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  the company considers experience with costs for replacement parts  costs of scrapping defective products  the number of product units subject to warranty claims and other direct costs associated with warranty claims 
if the cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than originally estimated  the company s accrued cost for warranty claims would increase 
at december   the warranty accrual amounted to million and amounts charged to expense were million 
at december   the warranty accrual amounted to million and amounts charged to expense were million 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  exclusive of goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company s most significant long lived assets subject to these periodic assessments of recoverability are property  plant and equipment  which have a net book value of million at december  because the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  these estimates may vary due to a number of factors  some of which may be outside of management s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to achieve management s forecasts of future income  it may become necessary to record impairment losses for any excess of the net book value of property  plant and equipment over its fair value 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis based on values at the end of the fourth quarter or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment and has determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value  so no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
goodwill of approximately million is included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and management s assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today 
deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances known at the time  while the actual effective rate is calculated at year end 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
during the third quarter of  the company reversed all valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets as management believed that it was more likely than not that all deferred tax assets would be realized taking into consideration all available evidence including historical pre tax and taxable income  projected future pre tax and taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
the reversal was recorded as an offset against income tax expense in the amount of million of which million relates to projected future pre tax income 
self insurance reserves the company is partially self insured for certain employee health benefits 
the related liabilities are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s policy is to accrue the liabilities based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock option plans using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  issued subsequent to apb opinion no 
and amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock options using the intrinsic value based method described in apb opinion no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has been disclosing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the impact on net income and earnings per share had the fair value based method been adopted 
if the fair value method had been adopted  net income for  and would have been   and  lower than reported  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
the statement is effective for interim periods beginning january  the company expects to use the black scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions as those currently used to determine the pro forma compensation expense disclosed in the footnotes to these financial statements 
the company estimates that adoption of the statement will decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately to per share for stock options and other equity based compensation which were previously not expensed under apb no 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition

the favorable customer mix resulted from a combination of raising prices on certain historically low margin customers and selling directly to end users more often  thereby bypassing the distributor s share of the profit 
lower manufacturing costs primarily relate to higher sales volume resulting in increased labor productivity and other manufacturing efficiencies 
the company has also been successful in improving labor productivity through certain lean manufacturing projects making the company s production personnel more efficient

transactions with related and certain other parties there were no significant transactions with related and certain other parties during internal controls over financial reporting current sec rules implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act of will require the company s annual report on form k for fiscal to include a report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and a statement that the company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and a report on the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
however  it is possible that the company will become an accelerated filer as defined in rule b of the exchange act and if so this report and statement will need to be included in its form k for fiscal the company will not know whether it will become an accelerated filer until june   which is the next date at which this status is determined 
while the company has not yet identified any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting  there are no assurances that the company will not discover deficiencies in its internal controls as it implements new documentation and testing procedures to comply with the new section reporting requirement 
if the company discovers deficiencies or is unable to complete the work necessary to properly evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting  there is a risk that management and or the company s independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude that the company s internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
concentrations the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues and were primarily from the theatre segment 
trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately of net consolidated receivables at december  sales to amc theatres  inc represented approximately of consolidated sales 
additionally  receivables from vari international represented of net consolidated receivables at december  while the company believes its relationships with such customers are stable  most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party 
a significant decrease or interruption in business from the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the company sells its products 
in addition  advancing technologies  such as digital cinema  could disrupt historical customer relationships 
financial instruments that potentially expose the company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable 
the company sells product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions 
to minimize credit concentration risk  the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition or uses letters of credit 
increased competition also results in continued exposure to the company 
if the company loses market share or encounters more competition relating to the development of new technology for alternate means of motion picture presentation such as digital technology  the company may be unable to lower its cost structure quickly enough to offset the lost revenue 
to counter these risks  the company has initiated a cost reduction program  continues to streamline its manufacturing processes and is formulating a strategy to respond to the digital marketplace 
the company also is focusing on a growth and diversification strategy to find alternative product lines to become less dependent on the theatre exhibition industry 
however  no assurances can be given that this strategy will succeed or that the company will be able to obtain adequate financing to take advantage of potential opportunities 
the principal raw materials and components used in the company s manufacturing processes include aluminum  reflectors  electronic subassemblies and sheet metal 
the company utilizes a single contract manufacturer for each of its intermittent movement components  reflectors  certain aluminum castings  lenses and xenon lamps 
although the company has not to date experienced a significant difficulty in obtaining these components  no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the future 
the loss of any one or more of such contract manufacturers could have a short term adverse effect on the company until alternative manufacturing arrangements were secured 
the company is not dependent upon any one contract manufacturer or supplier for the balance of its raw materials and components 
the company believes that there are adequate alternative sources of such raw materials and components of sufficient quantity and quality 
hedging and trading activities the company does not engage in any hedging activities  including currency hedging activities  in connection with its foreign operations and sales 
to date  all of the company s international sales have been denominated in us dollars  exclusive of strong westrex  inc sales  which are denominated in hong kong dollars 
in addition  the company does not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts at fair value 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist principally of leasing various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are summarized below along with the company s other contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt postretirement benefits operating leases less sublease receipts net contractual cash obligations there were no other contractual obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
seasonality generally  the company s business exhibits a moderate level of seasonality as sales of theatre products typically increase during the third and fourth quarters 
the company believes that such increased sales reflect seasonal increases in the construction of new motion picture screens in anticipation of the holiday movie season 
environmental and legal see note to the consolidated financial statements  and item of this report  for a full description of all environmental and legal matters 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on its net revenues or profitability 
the company did experience higher than normal prices on certain raw materials during the year coupled with higher freight costs as freight companies passed on a portion of higher gas and oil costs 
historically  the company has been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
outlook the company has begun to see evidence of the theatre exhibition industry s expected transition to digital cinema during theatre owners are now evaluating their options as they plan capital expenditures relative to new or used film projectors or digital equipment 
however  the extent and timing of the impact to ballantyne s revenues and operations is currently unclear 
digital cinema remains an important component of the company s long term growth strategy  and it continues to work closely with its partner  nec solutions america  inc  to launch this next generation technology within the exhibition industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company markets its products throughout the united states and the world 
as a result  the company could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic conditions 
in particular  the company was impacted by the downturn in the north american theatre exhibition industry in fiscal years to in the form of lost revenues and bad debts 
additionally  as a majority of sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar can and sometimes has made the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
as stated above  the majority of the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars except for its subsidiary in hong kong 
the company purchases the majority of its lenses from a german manufacturer 
based on forecasted purchases during  an average devaluation of the dollar compared to the euro would cost the company approximately million 
the company has also evaluated its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
if the company would borrow up to the maximum amount available under its variable interest rate credit facility  a one percent increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by  per annum 
no amounts are currently outstanding under the credit facility 
interest rate risks from the company s other interest related accounts such as its postretirement obligations are deemed to not be significant 
the company has not historically and is not currently using derivative instruments to manage the above risks
