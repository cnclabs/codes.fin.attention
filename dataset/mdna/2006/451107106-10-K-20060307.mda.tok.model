introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is ipc 
due to the repeal of the public utility holding company act of act  effective february   idacorp is no longer subject to any provisions under the act 
idacorp is a holding company under the newly enacted public utility holding company act of act  which provides certain access to books and records to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state utility regulatory commissions and imposes certain record retention and reporting requirements on idacorp 
ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp s other subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs holder of affordable housing and other real estate investments  idatech  llc idatech developer of integrated fuel cell systems  over percent owned by idacorp s wholly owned subsidiary idacorp technologies  inc iti  idacomm  inc idacomm provider of telecommunications services and commercial internet services  ida west energy company ida west operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
in  ida west discontinued its project development operations and began managing its independent power projects with a reduced workforce  and idacorp energy ie  marketer of electricity and natural gas  which wound down its operations in while reading the md a  please refer to the consolidated financial statements of idacorp and ipc  which present the financial position at december  and  and the results of operations and cash flows for each company for the years ended december   and forward looking information in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of reform act  idacorp and ipc are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements as such term is defined in the reform act made by or on behalf of idacorp or ipc in this annual report on form k  in presentations  in response to questions or otherwise

executive overview financial results idacorp s net income in was million compared to million in diluted earnings per share eps for the year of was a per share decrease from s results of per share 
the key components of the change in annual idacorp net income are ipc s earnings increased to million  a million increase over last year 
this increase resulted primarily from improved operating margins resulting from the implementation of general rate increases in june of both years 
ipc set a record for annual general business customer growth with a gain of  customers to  this represents a percent increase year over year 
idacomm lost million in compared to a million loss in in the fourth quarter of  idacomm recorded a million goodwill impairment  which resulted principally from a revision to the company s business strategy and decision to phase out the broadband over powerline bpl portion of its business 
net loss at iti increased from million to million as idatech accelerates in its product development phase 
the increase results from a million reduction in sales of products in development  and a million increase in product development costs 
earnings at ie increased from million in to million in  due primarily to a million reduction in the allowance for uncollectible accounts due from california parties in the california refund proceeding 
this adjustment was based on management s assessment of negotiations to settle the legal actions surrounding transactions in the california markets in and on february   ie and ipc jointly filed with several california parties an offer of settlement at the ferc 
final comments on the settlement are due to be filed by march   after which the ferc will determine whether to approve the settlement 
this matter is discussed in more detail in legal matters 
in  ie had recorded million of gains on settlement of legal disputes 
in  ifs contributed million less to earnings than in the prior year 
in  ifs recorded a million gain on the sale of its investment in the el cortez hotel in san diego  california 
per share amounts in were also affected by the issuance of approximately four million shares of idacorp common stock in december business strategy idacorp is focusing on a back to basics strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
ipc continues to experience strong customer growth in its service area  and this corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make substantial investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
ifs  with its affordable housing and historic rehabilitation portfolio  remains a key component of the corporate strategy 
the strategy includes seeking timely rate relief in both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
ipc plans to file in idaho and oregon for either asset specific or general rate relief regularly in upcoming years 
in  ipc received approval from the ipuc of a rate request related to costs incurred in connection with the construction of the bennett mountain power plant 
ipc also filed an idaho general rate case in the fall  a proposed settlement of this case was filed for ipuc approval in february idacorp has revised its business strategy for idacomm  its wholly owned communications subsidiary 
idacomm now will focus on building its existing competitive local exchange carrier business in boise  idaho and las vegas and reno  nevada  and phasing out the portion of its business exploring the potential use of bpl technology 
idacorp is reviewing strategic alternatives for idatech s fuel cell business  including its possible sale or merger in an effort to minimize the financial impact on idacorp 
idatech is transitioning from developmental projects to commercial products 
regulatory matters idaho general rate case ipc filed a general rate case in october  requesting the ipuc to approve an annual increase to its idaho retail base rates of million or percent 
base rates primarily reflect ipc s cost of providing electrical service to its customers  including equipment  vehicles and infrastructure 
on february   ipc  the ipuc staff and representatives of customer groups filed a proposed stipulation with the ipuc that  if approved  would settle this case 
the stipulation calls for an million increase  or percent in ipc s annual electric rates 
if approved by the ipuc  the changes in rates are expected to become effective on june  the rate case filing was made with six months of actual operating expenses and six months of projected expenses 
the agreed to increase in rates was lower than the requested amount primarily due to three factors actual numbers were significantly less than those forecasted  the overall rate of return agreed to was percent compared to the percent ipc requested no specific return on equity was determined  and net power supply costs were kept at levels currently existing in rates 
as a result of the settlement  ipc s overall rate of return will increase from the percent currently authorized 
emission allowances during the fourth quarter of  ipc sold  excess sulfur dioxide so emission allowances out of a total of approximately  excess allowances on the open market for approximately million 
through february   ipc has sold an additional  emission allowances for approximately million and plans to continue selling surplus allowances as market conditions permit 
ipc is now seeking an order from the ipuc to determine the accounting treatment for these transactions and the allocation of proceeds between retail customers and shareholders 
under the approved interim accounting treatment  ipc is recording the idaho and oregon allocated portions of the proceeds net of expenses as a regulatory liability 
at this time  ipc cannot predict how the proceeds might ultimately be allocated 
shareholder lawsuits in connection with the shareholder lawsuits filed against idacorp and four of its officers and directors in  on september   magistrate judge mikel h 
williams of the us district court for the district of idaho issued a report and recommendation that the defendants motion to dismiss be granted and that the case be dismissed 
the magistrate judge determined that the plaintiffs did not satisfactorily plead loss causation ie  a causal connection between the alleged material misrepresentation and the loss in conformance with the standards set forth in the recent united states supreme court decision of dura pharmaceuticals  inc v 
broudo  us  s 
ct 

the magistrate judge also concluded that it would be futile to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint because it did not appear that they could cure the deficiencies in their pleadings 
the parties have each filed objections to different parts of the magistrate judge s report and recommendation  and the matter is now before the district judge 
capital requirements and cash flows ipc estimates that it will spend million on construction expenditures over the next three years 
this amount reflects the need for additional resources in order for ipc to supply power to its growing number of customers 
forecasts indicate that internal cash generation after dividends will provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and continued reliance on externally financed capital 
the contribution for internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs 
idaho water management issues six years of below normal water conditions have exacerbated a developing water shortage in the state of idaho  which is manifested by a number of water issues including declining snake river base flows and declining levels in the eastern snake plain aquifer 
these issues are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects 
as a result of declines in river flows  in several surface water users filed delivery calls with the idaho department of water resources  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls have resulted in the several administrative actions before the idaho department of water resources and judicial actions before the state district court in ada and gooding counties in idaho challenging the constitutionality of state regulations used by the department to conjunctively administer ground and surface water rights 
ipc is participating in several of these actions to protect its interests and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the aquifer from further depletion 
one management option being explored is aquifer recharge  or using surface water supplies to increase ground water supplies by allowing the water to percolate into the aquifer in porous locations 
under certain circumstances aquifer recharge may impact senior water rights  including water rights held by ipc for hydropower purposes  and therefore conflict with state law 
for that reason  ipc continues to participate in the processes that are considering solutions  such as aquifer recharge  to the conflict between ground and surface water interests in an effort to protect its existing hydroelectric generation water rights 
in february  at the request of senior surface water interests  ipc entered into discussions with the state of idaho and senior surface water interests to explore opportunities for engaging in some limited aquifer recharge in  provided any adverse impact to ipc s hydropower generation and its customers is adequately addressed 
these discussions continue and are expected to reach conclusion by mid march or early april relicensing ipc s most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and approximately percent of its total generating capacity 
over the past year  ipc has participated in negotiations with a number of interested parties in an attempt to develop a comprehensive agreement for relicensing the hells canyon complex 
to date  however  the parties have not been successful in reaching an agreement 
because it was unlikely that the parties to the settlement process would reach an agreement on a comprehensive settlement package in the near term and with the issuance of the notice of ready for environmental analysis nrea by the ferc in october  the settlement discussions were terminated to allow the parties the opportunity to develop comments and preliminary terms and conditions for filing with the ferc 
the parties expect to reassess opportunities for settlement in the spring of after the filings with the ferc 
energy policy act of on august   the president signed into law the energy policy act of energy act  which is a comprehensive energy bill affecting the regulation of energy companies  including ipc 
key provisions of the energy act that may affect ipc include creation of an electric reliability organization that the ferc will appoint and oversee to establish and enforce mandatory reliability rules regarding the interstate electric transmission system  requirements for the ferc to establish incentive based transmission rate policies  ferc backstop authority for transmission line siting in corridors of national interest  changes in authority over regional transmission organizations  amendments to purpa  prospectively terminating mandatory purchase and sale requirements when a qualifying facility has access to competitive markets and eliminating the prohibition against utility ownership of qualifying facilities  reform of the hydroelectric licensing process to provide trial type hearings for disputed facts regarding license conditions  to create a process for licensees to propose alternatives to prescribed conditions and to require prescribing authorities to balance competing interests  incentives to develop additional generation at existing hydroelectric dams  creation of significant tax incentives to encourage and promote electricity reliability  renewable and clean energy investment and clean coal  and other energy efficiency and conservation  and repeal of the act and amendments to the federal power act fpa  effective february   giving the ferc i increased authority over mergers involving public utilities and the acquisition of the securities of electric utility companies and holding companies  ii authority to protect public utilities from cross subsidization and the encumbrance of utility assets  iii authority to set cost allocation methods for affiliate transactions involving public utilities  and iv providing the ferc and state commissions increased access to the books and records of holding company systems 
implementation of the energy act requires the development of regulations by the ferc  the department of energy and other federal agencies as well as proceedings at the state level 
the ferc has adopted numerous new rules and regulations  including new rules relating to utility acquisitions and dispositions  books and records access  electric utility reliability and reliability organizations  and procedures for determining conditions or proscriptions on hydropower licenses 
the ferc also has issued proposed rules that are still undergoing review and comment 
idacorp and ipc are currently monitoring the energy act s implementation to determine its effects on the companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates idacorp s and ipc s discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires idacorp and ipc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  idacorp and ipc evaluate these estimates  including those related to rate regulation  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation  impairment of assets  income taxes  unbilled revenues and bad debt 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
idacorp and ipc  based on their ongoing reviews  will make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
idacorp and ipc believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for rate regulation a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and return these regulatory liabilities  such recovery is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if ipc should determine in the future that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas  it would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
ipc intends to seek recovery of all of its prudent costs  including stranded costs  in the event of deregulation 
however  due to the current lack of definitive legislation  ipc cannot predict whether recovery would be successful 
if ipc has to write off a material amount of the regulatory assets  it will have a material adverse effect on ipc s results of operations and financial position 
pension expense ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees and an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors 
idacorp s and ipc s recorded pension expense for these plans is dependent on a number of factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several actuarial assumptions used in the valuations upon which pension expense is based 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management reviews these assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop these assumptions are extremely uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and ipc utilize data published in the citigroup pension liability index and apply the rates therein against the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be reduced to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current low interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
pension expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
for  pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the reduction of the discount rate noted above 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were made to the qualified plan in through  and none are expected in under the non qualified plan  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
payments averaged approximately million per year from to  and a similar amount is anticipated in please refer to note of idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about pension expense  including results of the actuarial valuations  actuarial assumptions used to measure pension expense and information about plan assets 
contingent liabilities there are a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory  legal and tax matters 
contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
the companies have made estimates of the ultimate resolution of all such matters  based on the facts and circumstances  opinions of legal counsel and other factors 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
asset impairment idacorp has several assets that are evaluated for impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
those assets that were evaluated in include the following goodwill at december   idacorp had million of goodwill related to its investments in idatech 
in  idacorp recorded an impairment of the entire million goodwill balance related to its investment in idacomm 
idacorp follows the impairment testing provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that more likely than not would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of the impairment 
idacorp s annual impairment tests were conducted as of june  and at that time no impairment was noted 
the strategic decision made in december to exit one of idacomm s lines of business  bpl  triggered the requirement to conduct another impairment test 
based on the results of that test  idacomm s goodwill balance was impaired 
the fair value calculations used for these tests require idacorp to make assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
assumptions related to future market demand  market prices and product costs could vary from actual results  and the impact of such variations could be material 
factors that could affect the assumptions include changes in economic conditions  success in developing marketable products and services and competitive conditions in the telecommunications and fuel cell industries 
long lived assets long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
southwest intertie project ipc began developing the southwest intertie project swip in ipc s investment consists predominantly of a federal permit for a specific transmission corridor in nevada and idaho and also private rights of way in idaho 
the swip rights of way extend from midpoint substation in south central idaho through eastern nevada to the dry lake area northeast of las vegas  nevada 
in the bureau of land management granted a five year extension to begin construction of a proposed kv transmission line within the rights of way before december on march  ipc entered into an agreement with white pine energy associates  llc white pine  an affiliate of ls power development  llc  which provides white pine a three year exclusive option to purchase the swip rights of way from ipc 
the option may be exercised in part or as a whole and  if fully exercised  will result in a net pre tax gain to ipc of approximately million 
based on management expectations regarding swip  no impairment has been identified 
investments ifs has affordable housing and other investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for two investments now consolidated under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
prior to the decision to discontinue ida west s project development activities  ida west had the intent and ability to hold the investments for a period sufficient to recover the recorded value 
based upon the change in management s intent  these investments were tested for impairment  and two of the investments were determined to be impaired  resulting in a write down of million in the impairment amounts are based on the estimated fair value of the investments 
impairment tests on these investments were performed in and no impairment was noted 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
unbilled revenue ipc s retail revenues include an estimate of mwhs delivered but unbilled at the end of each period 
unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require management s judgment 
unbilled revenue is calculated by taking daily estimates of mwhs delivered and applying information from the meter reading schedule to estimate the portion of mwhs delivered that have not been billed 
these unbilled mwhs are then allocated to the retail customer classes based on estimated usage by each class 
ipc then records revenue for each customer class based on their respective rates 
due to the seasonal fluctuations of ipc s actual load  the amount of unbilled revenue increases during the summer and winter months and decreases during the spring and fall 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the following table presents earnings for idacorp s segments as well as for the holding company ipc utility operations idacorp financial services idacomm iti idacorp energy ida west energy holding company expenses total earnings average outstanding shares s earnings per diluted share utility operations operating environment ipc is one of the nation s few investor owned utilities with a predominantly hydroelectric generating base 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  ipc s generation operations can be significantly affected by weather conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of ipc s hydroelectric facilities  springtime snow pack run off  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into ipc s hydroelectric projects are reduced  ipc s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from ipc s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  most likely  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in profitable off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
on a frequent basis  an operations plan is developed to provide guidance for generation resource utilization and energy market activities off system sales and power purchases 
the plan incorporates forecasts for generation unit availability  reservoir storage and stream flows  gas and coal prices  customer loads  energy market prices and other pertinent inputs 
consideration is given to when to use ipc s available resources to meet forecast loads and when to transact in the energy market 
the allocation of hydroelectric generation between heavy load and light load hours or various calendar periods is considered in development of the operating plan 
this allocation is intended to utilize the flexibility of the hydroelectric system to shift generation to high value periods  while operating within the constraints imposed on the system 
ipc s energy risk management policy  unit operating requirements and other obligations provide the framework for the plan 
in  ipc experienced its sixth consecutive year of below normal hydroelectric generating conditions 
the national weather service northwest river forecast center reports that april through july inflow to brownlee reservoir for totaled million acre feet maf  which is percent of average 
the annual brownlee inflow for was maf  which the river forecast center reports is percent of average 
however  the forecast released on february   by the northwest river forecast center indicates that brownlee inflow for april through july is expected to total maf  or percent of average 
snow pack accumulation for the snake river basin was percent of average on february  storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february  was percent of average  up from percent of average at the end of december october  storage in these reservoirs  which is considered carryover storage into water year  was percent of average  up from percent of average on october  with approximately one month remaining in the typical snow accumulation period for  conditions have improved from last year 
ipc s system load peaks in the summer and winter  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
ipc s record system peak of  mw occurred on july  peak summer demand in was  mw on july  and peak winter demand for the year was  mw on december ipc was able to meet system load requirements and off system sales requirements and had sufficient system reserves in place 
the following table presents ipc s power supply for the last three years mwh total system purchased hydroelectric thermal generation power total ipc s median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh  based on median hydrologic conditions for the standardized period of record  through general business revenue the primary influences on electricity sales are weather  customer growth and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
increased precipitation reduces electricity usage by these customers 
the following table presents ipc s general business revenues  mwh sales and average customers  and boise  idaho weather conditions for the three years revenue residential commercial industrial irrigation total mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total customers average residential commercial industrial irrigation total heating degree days cooling degree days precipitation heating and cooling degree days are a common measure used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning 
a degree day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees 
each degree of temperature above degrees is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below degrees is counted as one heating degree day 
normal heating degree days and cooling degree days are  and  respectively 
vs 
rates increased average rates resulting from higher base rates that took effect on june in both and increased revenues million 
this was partially offset by a net reduction in the power cost adjustment rates  which reduced revenue million from approximately million of the rate increase represents collection of previously recorded revenues from the irrigation load reduction program and rate case tax settlement 
this revenue is offset by a corresponding reduction to other revenues for the same amount 
customers a percent increase in average general business customers increased revenue million  as ipc continued to experience strong customer growth in its service territory 
ipc added over  general business customers during the year  and usage heavy spring precipitation reduced sales to irrigation customers by million 
rainfall during the second quarter of was double that of other weather and usage factors reduced sales to other customers by million 
vs 
rates lower average rates  resulting from the pca  decreased general business revenue million 
the decrease in pca revenues was approximately million 
this was partially offset by a million increase due to new base rates beginning on june  the rate changes were the result of several rate proceedings discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues  customers an increase in general business customers improved revenue million during ipc added nearly  general business customers during the year  a percent average increase  contract expiration the expiration in march of a take or pay contract with fmc astaris caused a million decrease in revenues for fmc astaris  formerly ipc s largest volume customer  closed its plants late in but was required under the contract to pay ipc for generation capacity regardless of delivery  and usage revenues decreased approximately million during mainly due to cooler summer weather 
cooling degree days for were percent less than  which had unusually hot summer temperatures 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
revenues grew percent due to higher energy prices in market prices were higher and more volatile because of oil and gas price increases due to instability in the middle east and hurricane damage on the gulf coast 
for the northwest  continuation of drought conditions in the region compounded the impact of these global problems 
consequently  off system sales revenue on a per mwh basis increased percent for the year 
off system sales volumes declined four percent  due primarily to changes in operating conditions and load and stream flow timing  which reduced market sales opportunities 
vs 
revenues from off system sales in grew significantly over due mainly to increased volumes sold 
the increased volumes sold were largely a result of power supply hedge activity in late spring based on temporarily improved hydroelectric generation 
although overall hydroelectric generating conditions were below normal  may precipitation was above normal and reservoir storage space was limited 
consequently  ipc generated more hydroelectric power than previously planned for may and june earlier hedge purchase activity combined with increased hydroelectric generation resulted in surplus energy 
other revenues the following table presents the components of other revenues transmission services and property rental bpa credit rate case tax settlement irrigation lost revenues total vs 
other revenues decreased million due mainly to the following in december  ipc recorded approximately million related to the recovery of lost revenue resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program 
the recovery was included as part of ipc s annual pca beginning on june   and million has been amortized as the amounts are billed 
this matter is discussed further in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs idaho  in  ipc recognized approximately million of revenue due to the ipuc order approving settlement no 
 which relates to the calculation of ipc s taxes for purposes of test year income tax expense in the idaho general rate case 
as a result of this settlement  ipc recorded a regulatory asset of approximately million from june  through may  million in and million in 
ipc began collecting this amount beginning in june with an adjustment to rates and million has been amortized as the amounts are billed  and in july  ipc recognized million of revenue from an agreement with the bonneville power administration for the release of  acre feet of storage water from brownlee reservoir 
this amount was included in the june  pca resulting in a benefit to ipc s idaho customers 
vs 
other revenues increased million over due mainly to the same factors discussed above 
purchased power purchased power purchases load reduction costs mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
purchased power expense grew percent due to higher energy prices in market prices were higher and more volatile for the reasons discussed above 
purchased power expense on a per mwh basis increased percent for the year 
purchased power volumes declined nine percent 
different operating conditions and system load and stream flow timing led to reduced market purchase activities 
vs 
the increase in purchased power expense was mostly due to a percent increase in volumes purchased 
the increased volumes purchased were a result of power supply hedge activity based on expectations of reduced hydroelectric generation due to continued below normal water conditions 
load reduction costs decreased from million in to zero due to the expiration in march of the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction program 
fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expenses and thermal plant volumes were essentially unchanged in vs 
fuel expenses increased in mainly due to a six percent rise in generation 
the increase in generation resulted from a return to normal operations at valmy  which produced percent more in than in this increase was partially offset by a percent reduction in generation from the boardman plant  which was offline for a longer period in in order to perform an upgrade to the turbine generator 
pca pca expense represents the effect of ipc s pca regulatory mechanism  which is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs idaho 
in  and  actual net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  exceeded those anticipated in the annual pca forecast  resulting in the deferral of a portion of those costs to subsequent years when they are to be recovered in rates

the following table presents the components of pca expense current year net power supply cost deferral fmc astaris and irrigation program cost deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances write offs of disallowed costs settlement agreement total power cost adjustment other operations and maintenance expenses vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million due mainly to the write off of million related to disallowed items in the idaho general rate case 
vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses increased million due mainly to the following an increase in payroll expense of million for an employee incentive program  which was partially triggered by the settlement relating to the irrigation load reduction program  a write off of million related to disallowed items in the idaho general rate case  and increases in transmission expense of million primarily due to the increase in purchased power

the increase in losses in results from a million reduction in sales of products in development  and a million increase in product development costs  partially offset by a million decrease in related income tax expense 
the loss in exceeded the loss in because of a million decline in sales and a million increase in costs  partially offset by a million decrease in related income tax expenses 
idacomm idacomm recorded net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  idacomm recorded a million goodwill impairment  which resulted principally from a revision to the company s business strategy and decision to phase out the portion of the business previously dedicated to exploring the potential use of bpl technology

in  ie wound down its power marketing operations  closed its business locations and sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading 
since that time  ie has had no operations but has been working to settle outstanding legal actions surrounding transactions in the california energy markets in and these matters  including a pending settlement agreement filed with the ferc for approval in february  are discussed in legal matters 
net income increased from million in to million in  due primarily to a million adjustment to an allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded in the fourth quarter of this adjustment was based on management s assessment of the negotiations to settle the aforementioned california refund proceedings 
if the settlement agreement is approved by the ferc  ie s required reserve may be further reduced 
the major transaction affecting results in was million of gains on settlements of legal disputes 
ie s results included a million gain from the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts in august this gain was offset by a loss on legal disputes of million  legal expenses of million  acceleration of depreciation expense of million  restructuring expenses of million and general and administrative costs of million 
on december   ie received a million cash payment from overton power district no 
for final settlement of a disputed receivable

ie expects this amount to be refunded no later than the end of the guarantee in the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and did not have a material effect on idacorp s financial statements 
see note of idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements for information related to restructuring costs of ie 
ida west ida west recorded net income loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  ida west discontinued its project development operations 
this decision resulted from the implementation of idacorp s new corporate strategy 
this strategy does not include the development or acquisition of merchant generation  which was ida west s focus 
ida west continues to manage its independent power projects with a reduced workforce 
impairment charges  as discussed below  negatively affected ida west s earnings in garnet impairment in  garnet  a wholly owned subsidiary of ida west  entered into an agreement with ipc to provide energy to be produced by garnet s proposed natural gas fired plant 
due to changes in the electricity industry  financing of the project on acceptable terms under the agreement became impracticable  and in  the agreement was mutually terminated 
based on the termination of the agreement and other factors including idacorp s decision to discontinue ida west s project development operations  an impairment charge was recorded for the remaining million investment balance in this impairment is presented on the consolidated statement of income in other operating expenses

income taxes status of audit proceedings in march  the internal revenue service irs began its examination of idacorp s through tax years 
on october   the idaho state tax commission also began its examination of the same tax years 
management believes that an adequate provision for income taxes and related interest charges has been made for the open years and after 
the accrued amounts are classified as a current liability in taxes accrued 
with the exception of the capitalized overhead cost method discussed below  management cannot predict with certainty which financial accounts or tax adjustments will be chosen by the irs for examination 
idacorp intends to vigorously defend its tax positions 
it is possible that material differences in actual outcomes  costs and exposures relative to current estimates  or material changes in such estimates  could have a material adverse effect on idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in  idacorp completed settlement of all issues related to the irs s examination of its federal income tax returns for the years through concurrently  ipc settled federal income tax deficiencies for the years and related to its partnership investment in the bridger coal company 
applicable state tax return amendments were completed in and settled 
finalization of these examinations resulted in deficiencies that were less than previously accrued  enabling idacorp to decrease income tax expense by million in and million in capitalized overhead costs on august   the irs and treasury department issued guidance interpreting the meaning of routine and repetitive for purposes of the simplified service cost and simplified production methods of the internal revenue code section a uniform capitalization rules 
the guidance was issued in the form of a revenue ruling rev 
rul 
and proposed and temporary regulations 
the regulations are effective for tax years ending on or after august   and the revenue ruling applies for all prior open years 
both pieces of guidance take a more restrictive view of the definition of self constructed assets produced by a taxpayer on a routine and repetitive basis than do the current treasury regulations 
generally  section a requires the capitalization of all direct costs and those indirect costs  known as mixed service costs  which directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the production of property by a taxpayer 
the treasury regulations for section a provide several safe harbor methods taxpayers may adopt in order to comply with the statute 
the simplified service cost method is one of the methods available for the calculation of indirect overhead mixed service costs cost capitalization 
ipc changed to the simplified service cost method for both the self construction of utility plant and production of electricity beginning with its federal income tax return 
for ipc  the simplified service cost method produces a current tax deduction for costs capitalized to electricity production that are capitalized into fixed assets for financial accounting purposes 
deferred income tax expense has not been provided for this deduction because the prescribed regulatory tax accounting treatment does not allow for inclusion of such deferred tax expense in current rates 
rate regulated enterprises are required to recognize such adjustments as regulatory assets if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from customers in future rates 
for fiscal years through  the simplified service cost method decreased ipc s income tax expense by million and resulted in cash refunds from federal and state tax authorities of million 
for years and prior open tax years  if ipc cannot satisfy the new guidance as currently drafted  ipc would be required to use another method of uniform capitalization  which could be more or less favorable to ipc than the simplified service cost method 
a less favorable method could result in a one time charge to earnings and reduced cash flow that could be partially offset by carryover tax credits  accelerated tax depreciation  changes in tax regulations and state regulatory recovery 
the temporary regulations are effective for ipc s tax year and  as drafted  preclude ipc from using this method for self constructed assets for and thereafter 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  ipc reversed its previously accrued tax deduction for capitalized overhead costs for both financial reporting and estimated tax payment purposes 
ipc is evaluating alternatives for a new uniform capitalization method 
ipc is actively involved in pursuing resolution of this matter and is working diligently with the irs in the examination process 
at this time  ipc cannot predict the earnings or cash flow impacts that the revenue ruling  temporary regulations  or additional action by the irs in this matter may have on or prior tax years 
regulatory settlement in  ipc and the ipuc finalized an income tax issue from ipc s idaho general rate case 
the issue concerned the regulatory accounting treatment for the capitalized overhead tax method ipc adopted in the idacorp federal income tax return 
as a result of the settlement  a million regulatory tax liability was reversed  creating benefit in tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards as of december   idacorp had million of general business credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes and million of idaho investment tax credit carryforward 
the general business credit carryforward period expires in and the idaho investment tax credit expires from to idacomm has a separate company net operating loss carryforward of million that expires from to the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforward is fully offset by a million valuation allowance recorded in accounting for uncertain tax positions on july   the fasb released an exposure draft for its proposed interpretation clarifying accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the proposed guidance addresses the recognition  measurement  classification  and disclosure issues related to the recording of financial statements benefits for income tax positions that have some degree of uncertainty 
in october the fasb announced that it has moved its projected issuance date of the final standard to the first quarter of the fasb met on this topic in november and january the significant developments to come from those meetings were recommendations to lower the interpretation s recognition threshold from probable to more likely than not and to delay the start date until the first annual period beginning after december  management is unable to predict the final action by the fasb  but is continuing to assess the provisions of this proposed interpretation as well as the recent fasb deliberations 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows for were million and million  respectively 
idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows decreased million and million respectively  compared to the decreases were mainly related to a million reduction in distributions from the bridger coal joint venture  as bridger is retaining cash to fund increased capital expenditures for conversion to underground mining  and timing of cash disbursements made in for december payable balances  including million in employee incentive compensation paid during the first quarter of in  net cash provided by operating activities was driven by ipc  where general business revenues and the costs to supply power to general business customers have the greatest impact on operating cash flows 
as ipc s service territory experienced below normal water conditions  the company relied more on higher cost thermal generation and wholesale power purchases to meet its energy needs 
idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows for were million and million  respectively 
idacorp s operating cash flows decreased million in as a result of reduced receipts from ipc s general business customers of million and an million decrease in net operating cash flows from ie 
in  ie received million from the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts and collected million on a note receivable from overton power district no 
these decreases in were partially offset by a million reduction in income taxes paid 
working capital changes in working capital accounts from december  to december  include other receivables at idacorp increased million due principally to a million margin deposit related to the sale of ie s energy marketing book to sempra energy trading 
idacorp s allowance for uncollectible accounts decreased million due predominantly to an adjustment of ie s allowance related to receivables from california entities 
idacorp s energy marketing assets and liabilities both increased million from changes in the mark to market values of ie s energy marketing contracts 
taxes accrued increased million at idacorp and million at ipc  primarily due to income taxes due on the million of emission allowances sold in the fourth quarter of other changes in working capital are due predominantly to timing and normal business activity 
environmental regulation costs ipc anticipates million in annual operating costs for environmental facilities during hydroelectric facility expenses account for million of this total and million is related to thermal plant operating expenses 
from through  total environmental related operating costs are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to the hydroelectric facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million during this period 
pension expense and contributions total pension expenses in were million and pension plan contributions were million for the qualified and non qualified plans 
pension expense is expected to increase to million in dividend reduction in september  idacorp s annual dividend was reduced to per share from per share 
this action was taken in order to strengthen idacorp s financial position  and its ability to fund ipc s growing capital expenditure needs 
the dividend reduction was also made to improve cash flows and help maintain credit ratings

i amounts include the obligations of various subsidiaries with the exception of ipc  which is shown separately 
off balance sheet arrangements the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes establish operational  reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of mining activities 
these obligations mandate that mine property be restored consistent with specific standards and the approved reclamation plan 
the mining operations at the bridger coal company are subject to these reclamation and closure requirements 
ipc has agreed to guarantee the performance of reclamation activities at bridger coal company  of which idaho energy resources co  a subsidiary of ipc  owns a one third interest 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december  bridger coal has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs and expects that the fund will be sufficient to cover all such costs 
because of the existence of the fund  the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal 
in august  ie sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading 
as part of the sale  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with sempra energy trading  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the indemnification expires at the end of and the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the impact of this guarantee on the consolidated financial statements was minimal 
credit ratings s p on november   s p announced that it had lowered the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and ipc 
the companies commercial paper rating was affirmed at a  and the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
s p stated that its decision reflected weakened financial ratios that have resulted from a combination of sustained drought conditions on the snake river that have depressed ipc s hydro production and increased deferred power costs  a disappointing general rate case ruling by the ipuc  partly mitigated by the approval of a settlement agreement on september   which granted ipc s position on income tax issues  and more than million of expected capital requirements by ipc 
s p stated that these pressures resulted in a financial profile that is weak even for the current bbb corporate credit rating 
further  s p stated that two key issues that would determine future ratings movement were water flows in the snake river and future rate case rulings by the ipuc 
moody s on december   moody s announced that it had lowered the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and the corporate credit ratings and long term and short term ratings of ipc 
the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
moody s stated that the downgrade of ipc s ratings reflected expected weaker cash flow coverage of interest and debt  the likelihood for continued negative free cash flow over the next few years  with internally generated funds falling short of meeting the dividend requirements of idacorp and significant utility related capital spending  persistent drought conditions that are likely to result in higher supply costs  not all of which are recoverable under ipc s power cost adjustment mechanism  the final resolution of ipc s rate case  which resulted in a revenue increase of a little more than half of ipc s updated request  and the likely need for additional support from the ipuc in future rate proceedings as ipc adds new generation and transmission infrastructure to help meet customer and load growth and ensure reliability of service 
according to moody s  the downgrade of idacorp s ratings reflected the weaker credit profile of ipc  which is by far the largest source of cash flow in the form of dividends to the parent company 
moody s stated that  with the continuing negative free cash flow trend for ipc  idacorp may need to depend more on dividends from its riskier non utility subsidiaries to meet its own fixed obligations and common dividend to shareholders  even though management has committed to a back to basics strategy of focusing on its regulated business 
in addition  moody s has assigned a baa rating to idacorp s five year million senior unsecured bank credit facility and a baa rating to ipc s five year million senior unsecured bank credit facility 
both facilities expire on march  moody s stated that the ratings assigned to the bank credit facilities reflected the pari passu ranking of the facilities with each company s other senior unsecured obligations 
the facilities serve as part of the alternate liquidity for each company s commercial paper program and contain a maximum percent total debt to total capitalization ratio covenant with a material adverse change clause as part of the representations and warranties relating to each credit extension 
in moody s view  the existence of the material adverse change clause detracts from the quality of the facilities since it could preclude access to funds at the time of greatest need 
fitch on january   fitch announced that it has lowered the long term ratings of idacorp and ipc and the short term debt ratings at ipc 
the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
fitch stated that the downgrade of ipc s ratings reflected ipc s increased earnings volatility and debt burden relative to cash flows  primarily due to the adverse effect of ongoing drought conditions in southern idaho and the lower than expected general rate case order issued by the ipuc in according to fitch  consolidated leverage has also been adversely affected by higher non utility debt 
fitch noted that the revised ratings also considered the moderating effect of ipc s pca mechanism  which has enabled the company to maintain solid interest coverage ratios  the positive impact of a more conservative corporate business profile and ongoing efforts to reduce financial leverage 
fitch stated that the stable rating outlook assumes a return to normal stream flows and hydroelectric generation output in access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
these downgrades have increased the cost of new debt and other issued securities

an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency 
such ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change

capital requirements the following table presents idacorp s and ipc s expected capital requirements from through millions of dollars ipc capital expenditures generating facilities hydroelectric thermal total generating facilities transmission lines and substations distribution lines and substations general other ipc total ipc ifs investments other total idacorp variations in the timing and amounts of capital expenditures will result from regulatory and environmental factors  load growth and other resource acquisition needs and the timing of relicensing expenditures 
internal cash generation after dividends is expected to provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through the contribution from internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs 
idacorp s internally generated cash after dividends is expected to provide percent of capital requirements excluding mandatory or optional principal payments on debt obligations 
idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing capital requirements with internally generated funds and externally financed capital 
in  sales of emission allowances provided investing cash of million 
on these sales  ipc is expects to pay approximately million in income taxes in the first quarter of  reducing idacorp s internally generated cash 
excluding the subsequent cash impacts from the sale of emission allowances  idacorp s internally generated cash after dividends is expected to provide percent of capital requirements 
utility construction program ipc s construction expenditures were million in  million in and million in ipc is experiencing a cycle of heavy infrastructure investment needed to address continued customer growth  peak demand growth  and aging plant and equipment 
as a result  ipc expects to spend million in construction expenditures from to the utility construction expenditure forecast includes million of construction costs for a mw combustion turbine peaking resource expected to be operational in mid  and million for an upgrade to the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility expected to be operational in ipc s aging hydroelectric facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement 
in addition  costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities are expected to increase substantially 
the three year construction program anticipates million of upgrades to existing hydroelectric facilities and million of costs associated with relicensing of hydroelectric facilities 
continuing load growth also requires that ipc add to its transmission system and distribution facilities to provide new service and to maintain reliability 
planned expenditures include distribution lines for new customers and several high voltage transmission lines 
based upon present environmental laws and regulations  ipc estimates its capital expenditures for environmental matters  excluding afdc  will total million 
studies and measures related to environmental concerns at ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and investments in environmental equipment and facilities at the thermal plants account for million 
from through  environmental related capital expenditures  excluding afdc  are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenditures related to ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and thermal plant expenditures are expected to total million 
ipc has no nuclear involvement and its future construction plans do not include development of any nuclear generation

the idacorp facility replaced idacorp s million facility that was to expire on march  the idacorp facility  which will be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up  will terminate on march  the idacorp facility provides for the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of million  provided that the aggregate amount of the standby letters of credit may not exceed million 
under the terms of the idacorp facility  idacorp may borrow floating rate advances and eurodollar rate advances 
the floating rate is equal to the higher of i the prime rate announced by wachovia bank or its parent and ii the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus percent per annum  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the eurodollar rate is based upon the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in us dollars published on the telerate page or any successor page as adjusted by the applicable reserve requirement for eurocurrency liabilities imposed under regulation d of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  for periods of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on idacorp s rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities without third party credit enhancement as provided by moody s investors services moody s and standard poor s ratings service s p 
the applicable margin for the floating rate advances is zero percent unless idacorp s rating falls below baa from moody s or bbb from s p  at which time it would equal percent 
the applicable margin for eurodollar rate advances ranges from percent to percent depending upon the credit rating 
in addition to the applicable margin  if the outstanding aggregate credit exposure exceeds percent of the facility amount  idacorp would pay a utilization fee ranging from percent to percent on outstanding loans depending on the credit rating 
at december   the applicable margin was zero percent for floating rate advances and percent for eurodollar rate advances and percent for a utilization fee 
a facility fee  payable quarterly by idacorp  is calculated on the average daily aggregate commitment of the lenders under the idacorp facility and is also based on idacorp s rating from moody s or s p as indicated above

a default or an acceleration of indebtedness of ipc in excess of million  including indebtedness under the ipc facility described below  will result in a cross default under the idacorp facility 
upon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of idacorp or the appointment of a receiver  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding percent of the outstanding loans or percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit under the facility or declare the obligations to be due and payable

legal and environmental issues legal and other proceedings shareholder lawsuits on may  and june   respectively  two shareholder lawsuits were filed against idacorp and certain of its directors and officers 
the lawsuits  captioned powell  et al 
v 
idacorp  inc  et al 
and shorthouse  et al 
v 
idacorp  inc  et al  raised largely similar allegations 
the lawsuits were putative class actions brought on behalf of purchasers of idacorp stock between february  and june   and were filed in the us district court for the district of idaho 
the named defendants in each suit  in addition to idacorp  are jon h 
miller  jan b 
packwood  j 
lamont keen and darrel t 
anderson 
the complaints alleged that  during the purported class period  idacorp and or certain of its officers and or directors made materially false and misleading statements or omissions about the company s financial outlook in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b  thereby causing investors to purchase idacorp s common stock at artificially inflated prices 
more specifically  the complaints alleged that idacorp failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them idacorp failed to appreciate the negative impact that lower volatility and reduced pricing spreads in the western wholesale energy market would have on its marketing subsidiary  ie  idacorp would be forced to limit its origination activities to shorter term transactions due to increasing regulatory uncertainty and continued deterioration of creditworthy counterparties  idacorp failed to account for the fact that ipc may not recover from the lingering effects of the prior year s regional drought and as a result of the foregoing  defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about idacorp and their earnings projections 
the powell complaint also alleged that the defendants conduct artificially inflated the price of idacorp s common stock 
the actions seek an unspecified amount of damages  as well as other forms of relief 
by order dated august   the court consolidated the powell and shorthouse cases for pretrial purposes  and ordered the plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint within days 
on november   idacorp and the directors and officers named above were served with a purported consolidated complaint captioned powell  et al 
v 
idacorp  inc  et al  which was filed in the us district court for the district of idaho 
the new complaint alleged that during the class period idacorp and or certain of its officers and or directors made materially false and misleading statements or omissions about its business operations  and specifically the ie financial outlook  in violation of rule b  thereby causing investors to purchase idacorp s common stock at artificially inflated prices 
the new complaint alleged that idacorp failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to it or recklessly disregarded by it idacorp falsely inflated the value of energy contracts held by ie in order to report higher revenues and profits  idacorp permitted ipc to inappropriately grant native load priority for certain energy transactions to ie  idacorp failed to file ancillary service agreements involving the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce that it was required to file under section of the federal power act  idacorp failed to file  contracts that ipc assigned to ie for the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce that ipc was required to file under section of the federal power act  idacorp failed to ensure that ie provided appropriate compensation from ie to ipc for certain affiliated energy transactions  and idacorp permitted inappropriate sharing of certain energy pricing and transmission information between ipc and ie 
these activities allegedly allowed ie to maintain a false perception of continued growth that inflated its earnings 
in addition  the new complaint alleges that those earnings press releases  earnings release conference calls  analyst reports and revised earnings guidance releases issued during the class period were false and misleading 
the action seeks an unspecified amount of damages  as well as other forms of relief 
idacorp and the other defendants filed a consolidated motion to dismiss on february   and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the consolidated motion to dismiss on march  idacorp and the other defendants filed their response to the plaintiff s opposition on april  and oral argument on the motion was held on may  on september   magistrate judge mikel h 
williams of the us district court for the district of idaho issued a report and recommendation that the defendants motion to dismiss be granted and that the case be dismissed 
the magistrate judge determined that the plaintiffs did not satisfactorily plead loss causation ie  a causal connection between the alleged material misrepresentation and the loss in conformance with the standards set forth in the recent united states supreme court decision of dura pharmaceuticals  inc v 
broudo  us  s 
ct 

the magistrate judge also concluded that it would be futile to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint because it did not appear that they could cure the deficiencies in their pleadings 
the parties have each filed objections to different parts of the magistrate judge s report and recommendation  and the matter is now before the district judge 
idacorp and the other defendants intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations 
idacorp cannot  however  predict the outcome of these matters

wholesale electricity antitrust cases i ii these cross actions against ie and ipc emerged from multiple california state court proceedings first initiated in late against various power generators marketers by various california municipalities and citizens 
suit was filed against entities including reliant energy services  inc  reliant ormond beach  llc  reliant energy etiwanda  llc  reliant energy ellwood  llc  reliant energy mandalay  llc and reliant energy coolwater  llc collectively  reliant  and duke energy trading and marketing  llc  duke energy morro bay  llc  duke energy moss landing  llc  duke energy south bay  llc and duke energy oakland  llc collectively  duke 
while varying in some particulars  these cases made a common claim that reliant  duke and certain others not including ie or ipc colluded to influence the price of electricity in the california wholesale electricity market 
the plaintiffs asserted various claims that the defendants violated the california antitrust law the cartwright act  business and professions code section and california s unfair competition law  business and professions code section among the acts complained of are bid rigging  information exchanges  withholding of power and other wrongful acts 
these actions were subsequently consolidated  resulting in the filing of plaintiffs master complaint in san diego superior court on march  on april   more than a year after the initial complaints were filed  two of the original defendants  duke and reliant  filed separate cross complaints against ipc and ie  and approximately other cross defendants 
duke and reliant s cross complaints sought indemnity from ipc  ie and the other cross defendants for an unspecified share of any amounts they must pay in the underlying suits because  they allege  other market participants like ipc and ie engaged in the same conduct at issue in the plaintiffs master complaint 
duke and reliant also sought declaratory relief as to the respective liability and conduct of each of the cross defendants in the actions alleged in the plaintiffs master complaint 
reliant also asserted a claim against ipc for alleged violations of the california unfair competition law  business and professions code section as a buyer of electricity in california  reliant requested the same relief from the cross defendants  including ipc  as that sought by plaintiffs in the plaintiffs master complaint as to any power reliant purchased through the california markets 
some of the newly added defendants foreign citizens and federal agencies removed that litigation to federal court 
ipc and ie  together with numerous other defendants added by the cross complaints  moved to dismiss these claims  and those motions were heard in september  together with motions to remand the case back to state court filed by the original plaintiffs 
on december   the us district court granted plaintiffs motion to remand to state court  but did not issue a ruling on ipc and ie s motion to dismiss 
the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit granted certain defendants and cross defendants motions to stay the remand order while they appeal the order 
the briefing on the appeal was completed in december on december   the ninth circuit issued its opinion in people of california v 
nrg energy  inc  et al  which affirmed the district court s remand of these cases to state court and dismissed certain federal government defendants due to their sovereign immunity from suit 
on june   the cross defendants  including ipc and ie  filed a demurrer in state court seeking to dismiss the cross complaints filed by duke and reliant 
on august   before that demurrer was to be heard  the clerk of the court entered duke s voluntary dismissal  with prejudice  of the cross complaint against ie and ipc 
further briefing and hearing on ie and ipc s demurrer to the reliant cross complaint was stayed pending the outcome of the demurrer filed by reliant on the master complaint 
on september   the court took reliant s demurrer off calendar pending approval of a proposed settlement as to the plaintiff s master complaint 
on october  the court sustained the defendants other than reliant s joint demurrer to the master complaint and scheduled a status conference to discuss the status of the cross complaints 
on october  the court set ie and ipc s demurrer on the cross complaint for hearing on december  however  on november   judge joan m 
lewis approved a stipulation between the cross defendants  including ie and ipc  and reliant 
this stipulation provided for dismissal of ie and ipc by reliant with prejudice subject to reinstatement in the event that approval and finalization of a settlement agreement between reliant and the underlying plaintiffs in these cases does not occur 
the december  hearing on ie and ipc s demurrer to the cross complaint was taken off the calendar 
a hearing regarding approval of the reliant settlement was held on friday january  before judge lewis 
reliant has filed a request for dismissal of ie and ipc with prejudice  which was entered by the clerk of the court on december  pursuant to ie and ipc s stipulation with reliant  the dismissal will become final once any judgment and order from the court approving the reliant settlement with the plaintiffs becomes final ie  once the time for any appeal on the order approving the settlements runs or  if review is sought  the trial court s approval order is affirmed after resolution of all appeals 
the time for an appeal from an order approving the settlements would range from to days after entry of the court s judgments and orders 
if the court does not grant final approval for the reliant settlement  reliant may elect to reactivate its cross complaint 
similarly  should the court for any reason fail to approve the reliant settlement by may   ie and ipc may withdraw from the stipulation agreement by giving ten days advance written notice 
the companies intend to vigorously defend their position in this proceeding and believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
these matters are also discussed in note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements 
western energy proceedings at the ferc ie and ipc are involved in a number of ferc proceedings arising out of the western energy situation in california and claims that dysfunctions in the organized california markets contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices in pacific northwest spot markets  and may have been the result of manipulations of gas or electric power markets 
they include proceedings involving the chargeback provisions of the california power exchange calpx participation agreement triggered when a participant defaulted on a payment to the calpx 
upon such a default  other participants were required to pay their allocated share of the default amount to the calpx 
this provision was first triggered by the southern california edison default and later by the pacific gas and electric company default 
the ferc has ordered the calpx to hold the chargeback funds and that such funds may be used to make up individual seller shortfalls in their calpx account at the conclusion of the california refund proceeding 
one party has appealed this order to the dc circuit court of appeals 
based upon the settlement agreement filed with the ferc on february  regarding the california refund proceeding  the california parties supported a request that the ferc authorize the calpx to release million to ie and ipc  the california refund proceeding is an efforts by the state of california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales from sellers of electricity into california from october  through june  california is claiming that the sales prices were not just and reasonable and were not in compliance with the federal power act 
the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march  on which multiple parties  including ie  sought rehearing 
on october   the ferc denied the requests for rehearing and required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing regarding refund amounts within five months  which has since been delayed until march on may   the ferc issued an order clarifying its earlier refund orders and denying a request by certain parties to present as evidence an earlier settlement between the california public utilities commission and el paso related to manipulation of gas pipeline capacity claiming that the settlement dollars california is receiving from el paso billion are duplicative of the ferc order changing the gas component of its refund methodology 
the ferc denied requests for rehearing on november  on december   ie and others petitioned the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc s orders on california refunds 
as additional ferc orders have been issued  further petitions for review have been filed  including by ie  and have been consolidated with the appeals already pending before the ninth circuit 
on september   the ninth circuit convened the first of its case management proceedings  a procedure reserved to help organize complex cases 
on october   the ninth circuit severed several issues related to the ferc s refund jurisdiction  established a schedule for briefing and held oral argument on april and  on may   the california parties filed a motion with the ferc to submit additional evidence 
a number of parties are opposing this motion 
on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision in one of the severed cases concluding that the ferc lacked refund authority over wholesale electrical energy sales made by governmental entities and non public utilities 
on august  the ferc issued an order establishing a framework for those sellers wanting to make a cost filing to demonstrate that the generally applicable ferc refund methodology interfered with the recovery of costs 
the companies along with others made a cost filing on september   the california entities commented on october   and ipc and ie replied to those comments on october  the california entities filed supplemental comments on october  and the companies filed supplemental reply comments on october  in december ie and ipc reached a tentative agreement with the california parties settling matters encompassed by the california refund proceeding including ie and ipc s cost filing and refund obligation 
on january   the parties filed a request with the ferc asking that ferc defer ruling on ie and ipc s cost filing for thirty days so the parties could complete and file the settlement agreement with the ferc 
on january   the ferc granted the requested deferral and required that the settlement be filed by february  on february   ie and ipc jointly filed with the california parties pacific gas electric company  san diego gas electric company  southern california edison company  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  the california department of water resources and the california attorney general an offer of settlement at the ferc 
final comments on the settlement are due to be filed by march   after which the ferc will determine whether to approve the settlement 
if the settlement is approved by the ferc  ie and ipc will assign million of the rights to accounts receivable from the cal iso and the calpx to the california parties to pay into an escrow account for refunds to settling parties 
amounts from that escrow not used for settling parties and million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables which are to be retained by the calpx are available to fund  at least partially  payment of the claims of any non settling parties if they prevail in the remaining litigation of this matter 
approximately million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables are to be released to ie and ipc 
at december   with respect to the calpx chargeback and the california refund proceedings discussed above  the calpx and the cal iso owed million and million  respectively  for energy sales made to them by ipc in november and december in the fourth quarter of ie reduced by million to million its reserve against these receivables 
this reserve was calculated taking into account the uncertainty of collection  given the california energy situation 
based on the reserve recorded as of december   idacorp believes that the future collectibility of these receivables or any potential refunds ordered by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  the pacific northwest refund proceedings wherein it was argued that the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market  warranting refunds 
the ferc rejected this claim on june   and denied rehearing on november  and february  the ferc orders were appealed to the ninth circuit  which established a briefing schedule under which final briefs were submitted in may there presently is no date set for oral argument 
ie and ipc are unable to predict the outcome of these matters  and two ferc show cause orders which resulted from a ruling of the ninth circuit that the ferc permit the california parties in the california refund proceeding to submit materials to the ferc demonstrating market manipulation by various sellers of electricity into california 
on june   the ferc ordered a large number of parties including ipc to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or anomalous market behavior partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
on october   ipc reached agreement with the ferc staff on the show cause orders 
the gaming settlement was approved by the ferc on march  the ferc approved the motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding on january  although the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit  the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests 
eight parties have requested rehearing of the ferc s march  order approving the gaming settlement but the ferc has not yet acted on those requests 
in addition to the two show cause orders  on june   the ferc also issued an order instituting an investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western wholesale markets for the time period may  through october  to review evidence of economic withholding of generation 
ipc  along with over other market participants  responded to ferc data requests and the ferc terminated its investigations as to ipc on may  numerous parties have appealed the ferc s termination of this investigation as to ipc and over other market participants 
the february  settlement  if approved by the ferc  also provides a basis for ferc disposition of the gaming settlement 
these matters are discussed in more detail in note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements 
other legal proceedings idacorp  ipc and or ie are involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings in addition to those discussed above and in note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements 
the companies believe they have meritorious defenses to all lawsuits and legal proceedings where they have been named as defendants 
resolution of any of these matters will take time  and the companies cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings 
the companies believe that their reserves are adequate for these matters 
environmental issues idaho water management issues the state of idaho has experienced six consecutive years of below normal precipitation and stream flows 
these conditions have exacerbated a developing water shortage in the state  which is manifested by a number of water issues including declining snake river base flows and declining levels in the eastern snake plain aquifer  a large underground aquifer that has been estimated to hold between maf of water 
these issues are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects 
with respect to base flows  observed records suggest that the base flows in the snake river  particularly between ipc s twin falls and swan falls projects  have been in decline for several decades 
the yearly average flow measured below swan falls declined at an average rate of cubic feet per second cfs per year during the period  and between twin falls and lower salmon falls  which significantly contribute to base flow  declined at a rate of approximately cfs per year over the same period 
low flow in the snake river near hagerman  idaho continued to be observed during  where several river gauges in that area recorded the lowest january march snake river flows since the early s 
as a result of these declines in river flows  in several surface water users filed delivery calls with the idaho department of water resources  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls have resulted in several administrative actions before the idaho department of water resources and judicial actions before the state district court in ada and gooding counties in idaho challenging the constitutionality of state regulations used by the department to conjunctively administer ground and surface water rights 
one such action  filed in january  involves seven surface water irrigation entities from above milner dam that submitted a delivery call letter to the director of the idaho department of water resources requesting that the director administer and deliver their senior natural flow and storage water rights pursuant to idaho law 
the irrigation entities contend that existing data reflects that senior surface water rights above milner dam have been reduced by approximately  acre feet  a percent reduction  over the past six years due  in part  to junior groundwater pumping from the eastern snake plain aquifer  and that these reductions have resulted in cumulative shortages in natural flow and storage water accrual in american falls reservoir  a us bureau of reclamation reservoir that supplies a portion of their senior water rights 
the idaho ground water appropriators  inc  an idaho non profit corporation organized to promote and represent the interests of groundwater users  and the us bureau of reclamation  the owner of american falls reservoir  petitioned to intervene in the delivery call action 
both petitions were granted 
since ipc holds water rights that are dependent on the snake river  spring flows and the overall condition of the eastern snake plain aquifer  ipc is participating in several of these actions to protect its interests and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the aquifer from further depletion 
one management option being explored is aquifer recharge  or using surface water supplies to increase ground water supplies by allowing the water to percolate into the aquifer in porous locations 
under certain circumstances aquifer recharge may impact senior water rights  including water rights held by ipc for hydropower purposes  and therefore conflict with state law 
for that reason  ipc continues to participate in the processes that are considering solutions  such as aquifer recharge  to the conflict between ground and surface water interests in an effort to protect its existing hydroelectric generation water rights 
in february  at the request of senior surface water interests  ipc entered into discussions with the state of idaho and senior surface water interests to explore opportunities for engaging in some limited aquifer recharge in provided any adverse impact to ipc s hydropower generation and its customers is adequately addressed 
these discussions continue and are expected to reach conclusion by mid march or early april clean air the environmental protection agency epa issued sulfur dioxide so allowances  as defined in the clean air act amendments of  based on coal consumption during established baseline years 
ipc currently has more than a sufficient amount of so 

allowances to provide compliance for emissions attributable to ipc at all three of its jointly owned coal fired facilities and both of its natural gas fired facilities 
prior to the sale of  emission allowance in and early discussed below in emission allowances  ipc believed that it had approximately  allowances in excess of the amount needed for clean air act compliance 
in addition  ipc has been granted annual allotments of allowances ranging from  to  through the year allowances necessary for ipc s compliance requirements are up to  annually 
excess allowances owned by ipc may be held for future use  as they do not contain expiration terms 
there is an active marketplace for buying and selling allowances  so that so 

allowances determined to be excess can be sold to others 
for all the foregoing reasons  ipc does not foresee any adverse effects upon its operations with regard to so emissions at this time 
see further discussion in regulatory issues emission allowances 
in march  the epa issued two new rules limiting emissions from utility boilers  the clean air interstate rule and the clean air mercury rule 
the clean air interstate rule will cap emissions of so and nitrogen oxides no 
x 
in eastern states and the district of columbia 
the clean air interstate rule does not impose any restrictions on emissions from any ipc facilities 
ipc does not foresee any adverse effects upon its operations with regard to the clean air interstate rule 
the clean air mercury rule camr will limit mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and creates a market based cap and trade program that will permanently cap utility mercury emissions in two phases 
currently  power plants in the united states emit approximately tons of mercury per year 
the first phase cap is tons beginning in  with a second phase cap set at tons beginning in mercury emission allocations have been set at the state level  but the states have not allocated the allowances to individual utilities 
ipc is actively monitoring developments on this issue and control equipment technology advances 
the camr is being challenged in court by a number of environmental groups and some states 
on october   the epa granted requests from petitions to reconsider certain aspects of the camr 
it is anticipated that this rule may require additional emission controls and expenses at ipc s jointly owned coal fired facilities  although impacts on future plant operations  operating costs and generating capacity are not known at this time 
other pending or proposed air regulations or legislation could require ipc s jointly owned coal fired facilities to reduce plant emissions of so  noxand other pollutants below current levels 
these reductions could be required to address regional haze programs  acid rain  mercury emission regulations and possible re interpretations and changes to the federal clean air act 
like many other coal fired facilities in the united states  the jim bridger plant has received information requests from the epa related to the plant s compliance with the new source review provisions of the clean air act  which has resulted in discussions with the epa and state regulatory authorities 
ipc may incur significant costs to comply with tighter air emissions requirements in the future 
these potential costs are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures 
in july  the epa announced the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and particulate matter pm and  in july  the epa announced regional haze regulations for protection of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas 
on may   a federal court ruling blocked implementation of the naaqs for ozone and pm 
in november  the epa appealed to the us supreme court to reconsider that decision 
the supreme court subsequently ruled in favor of the epa on february  the epa has promulgated regulations designating areas of the country for attainment non attainment with these standards  and ipc s thermal plants are located in areas designated as attainment for both standards 
epa and state efforts to implement the naaqs are ongoing 
on january   the epa proposed revisions to the pm naaqs that potentially could make these naaqs more stringent  and ipc continues to monitor the epa s proposed revisions 
litigation concerning the epa s regional haze regulations resulted in two separate court remands of the rule back to the epa for reconsideration 
on june   the epa issued the clean air visibility rule cavr to address the first court remand 
on july   the epa proposed revisions to the cavr to address the second remand 
although the impacts of the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter and the regional haze regulations on ipc s thermal operations are not known at this time  the future costs of compliance with these regulations could be substantial and will be dependent on if and how the programs are ultimately implemented 
global climate change the united states is currently not a party to the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change protocol that became effective for signatories on february  the protocol process generally requires developed countries to cap greenhouse gas emissions at certain levels from through greenhouse gas emissions are the result of many natural and man made processes including the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity 
carbon dioxide represents the largest quantity of greenhouse gases emitted at ipc s coal and gas generation units 
under median water conditions  the majority of ipc s generation is hydro based which has negligible greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil based generation 
although it has not ratified the protocol  the united states may adopt a national  mandatory greenhouse gas program at some point in the future 
at this time  ipc is unable to predict the potential impacts of any future mandatory governmental greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory requirements 
regulatory issues general rate case idaho ipc filed its idaho general rate case with the ipuc on october  the ipuc approved an increase of million in ipc s electric rates  an average of percent  in an order issued on may  the rate increase became effective on june  additionally  the ipuc approved a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
on july   after ipc petitioned the ipuc for reconsideration of certain items  the ipuc ordered rates increased by approximately million  in light of the ipuc staff s computational errors  on or before august  the ipuc also agreed to reconsider an issue relating to the determination of ipc s income tax expense 
as a result of this reconsideration  on september   the ipuc issued separate orders approving two settlement agreements entered into on august   between ipc and the ipuc staff 
in order no 
 the ipuc approved the modification of the general rate case order to utilize ipc s statutory income tax rates to compute test year income tax expense 
the rate case tax settlement allows ipc to continue its compliance with the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and associated treasury regulations  and will allow ipc to continue to receive the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation 
as a result  ipc computed and recorded monthly during the period june  through may  a regulatory asset with interest accrued at a rate of one percent per annum of approximately million  or percent  which is a one year adjustment and will expire on june  the ipuc also granted an ongoing adjustment of approximately million  or percent  related to the rate case tax settlement 
the increase of percent related to the rate case tax settlement adjustments was effective june  additionally  ipuc order no 
resolved outstanding issues related to an unplanned outage at one of the two units of valmy in the summer of  a matter relating to the expense adjustment rate for growth component of the pca and regulatory accounting issues related to a tax accounting method change in as a result  in september  ipc established a regulatory liability of million with a charge to pca expense 
a monthly credit of approximately million is included in the pca through may  which will reduce this regulatory liability 
also in september  ipc reversed a million regulatory tax liability by reducing income tax expense 
this regulatory tax liability was established in when ipc adopted a tax accounting method change for capitalized overhead costs 
the final result of ipc s idaho general rate case was a million increase to the base idaho jurisdictional revenue requirement  comprised of million in the initial order  million related to computational errors and million in the order approving the rate case tax settlement 
ipc filed a general rate case in october  requesting the ipuc to approve an annual increase to its idaho retail base rates of million or percent 
base rates primarily reflect ipc s cost of providing electrical service to its customers  including equipment  vehicles and infrastructure 
on february   ipc  the ipuc staff and representatives of customer groups filed a proposed stipulation with the ipuc that  if approved  would settle this case 
the stipulation calls for an million increase  or percent in ipc s annual electric rates 
if approved by the ipuc  the changes in rates are expected to become effective on june  the rate case filing was made with six months of actual operating expenses and six months of projected expenses 
the agreed to increase in rates was lower than the requested amount primarily due to three factors actual numbers were significantly less than those forecasted  the overall rate of return agreed to was percent compared to the percent ipc requested no specific return on equity was determined  and net power supply costs were kept at levels currently existing in rates 
as a result of the settlement  ipc s overall rate of return will increase from the percent currently authorized 
oregon on september   ipc filed an application with the opuc to increase general rates an average of percent or approximately million annually 
a partial settlement resolved most issues in a manner consistent with the final result in the idaho rate case 
the most significant issue in this proceeding was the appropriate quantification of net power supply expenses for purposes of setting rates 
the opuc staff proposed that net power supply expenses for ipc be set at a negative number meaning that ipc should be able to sell enough surplus energy to pay for all fuel and purchased power expenses and still have revenue left over to offset other costs 
the bulk of ipc s rebuttal was directed at this position 
a hearing was conducted on may  the opuc issued its order on july  authorizing an increase of  in annual revenues for an average of percent 
the opuc adopted the staff argument for the negative net power supply costs  thus reducing ipc s initial rate request of million by million with this one adjustment 
on september   ipc filed a complaint with the circuit court of marion county  oregon asking the court to reverse the portion of the opuc s general rate case order related to the determination of net power supply costs 
deferred power supply costs ipc s deferred net power supply costs consisted of the following at december idaho pca current year deferral for the rate year deferral for the rate year irrigation lost revenues idaho pca true up awaiting recovery authorized may authorized may oregon deferral costs costs total deferral million will be recovered with interest during the pca rate year 
idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments are based on forecasts of net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called the true up for the current year s portion and the true up of the true up for the prior years unrecovered portion  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca 
the true up of the true up portion of the pca provides a tracking of the collection or the refund of true up amounts 
each month  the collection or the refund of the true up amount is quantified based upon the true up portion of the pca rate and the consumption of energy by customers 
at the end of the pca year  the total collection or refund is compared to the previously determined amount to be collected or refunded 
any difference between authorized amounts and amounts actually collected or refunded are then reflected in the following pca year  which becomes the true up of the true up 
over time  the actual collection or refund of authorized true up dollars matches the amounts authorized 
on april   ipc filed the pca with the ipuc with a proposed effective date of june  the application proposed to hold the pca component of customers rates at the existing level  which is currently recovering million above base rates 
by ipuc order  the year s pca includes million in lost revenues and million in related interest resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program that was in place in ipc proposed to defer recovery of approximately million of power supply costs  or percent  for one year to help mitigate the impacts of the million  or percent  increase for the bennett mountain power plant and the million  or percent  increase due to the rate case tax settlement adjustments 
the million will be recovered during the pca rate year  and ipc will earn a two percent carrying charge on this balance 
the ipuc accepted the company s pca proposal 
oregon on march   ipc filed for an accounting order to defer net power supply costs for the period of march  through february  in anticipation of continued low water conditions 
the forecasted net power supply costs included in this filing were million  of which million related to the oregon jurisdiction 
ipc is proposing to use the same methodology for this deferral filing that was accepted in for oregon s share of ipc s net power supply expenses 
on july   ipc  the opuc staff  and the citizen s utility board entered into a stipulation requesting that the opuc accept ipc s proposed methodology 
under this methodology  ipc will earn its oregon authorized rate of return on the deferred balance and will recover the amount through rates in future years  as approved by the opuc 
fixed cost adjustment mechanism on january   ipc filed with the ipuc for authority to implement a rate adjustment mechanism which would adjust ipc s rates upward or downward to recover ipc s fixed costs independent from the volume of ipc s energy sales 
the filing is a continuation of an idaho case opened in to investigate the financial disincentives to investment in energy efficiency by ipc 
the true up mechanism  entitled fixed cost adjustment fca would be applicable only to residential service and small general service customers 
the fixed cost recovery portion of ipc s revenue requirement allowed for recovery in rates would be established for these two customer classes at the time of a general rate case 
thereafter  the fca would provide a mechanism to true up the collection of fixed costs to recover the difference between the fixed costs actually recovered through rates and the fixed costs that were allowed to be recovered 
accounting for the fca would be effective as of january   and the first fca rate change would occur on june  the fca is proposed to change rates coincidentally with ipc s power cost adjustment pca and ipc s seasonal rates 
although the fca would be timed to adjust on the same schedule as the pca  the accounting for the fca would be separate from the pca 
additionally  ipc proposes to include a three percent cap on any fca filing  to be applied at the discretion of the ipuc 
public utility regulatory policies act of as mandated by the enactment of purpa and the adoption of avoided cost rates by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside the ipc service territory 
for projects located outside the ipc service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that ipc has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts are fully recovered through the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy on a monthly basis are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and the opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
on august   the ipuc granted a temporary reduction in the eligible project size to kw for intermittent generation resources only 
this temporary project size reduction will remain in place until studies are completed which will help the ipuc determine if the published avoided cost should be revised for intermittent generation resources 
for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the opuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is recovered through general rate case filings 
the oregon provisions are currently being reviewed in an opuc proceeding 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
recent activities  including the extension of the federal production tax credit and the expansion of the tax credit for eligibility to solar  geothermal and other forms of generation  resolution of ipuc and opuc purpa related hearings and the december  order by the ipuc increasing the published avoided costs  create a favorable climate for purpa project development  which may require ipc to enter into additional purpa agreements 
the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements may result in ipc acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices  thus increasing costs to its customers 
additionally  it is highly likely that the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements will add to ipc s surplus during certain times of the year  potentially during off peak hours 
this could also increase costs to ipc s customers 
as of december   ipc had signed agreements to purchase energy from small power production cspp facilities with contracts ranging from one to years 
of these facilities  were on line at the end of  the other facilities under contract are due to come on line in and during  ipc purchased  mwh from these projects at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 
emission allowances in june  ipc filed applications with the ipuc and opuc requesting blanket authorization for the sale of excess sulfur dioxide emission allowances and an accounting order 
the ipuc issued order on august   authorizing the sale and interim accounting treatment 
pursuant to the order  ipc is required to file a report with the ipuc within days after receipt of any sale proceeds 
the opuc issued order on september   stating that ipc did not need a blanket order to sell emission allowances and approved the interim accounting treatment 
the opuc also ordered ipc to file a report within days after receipt of any sales proceeds and stated that ratemaking treatment of the proceeds will be determined in a ratemaking proceeding 
two reports on the sales proceeds have been filed with both the ipuc and the opuc 
ipc is now seeking approval from the ipuc for the accounting treatment of these transactions  which will determine the allocation of proceeds between retail customers and shareholders 
order stated that the ipuc staff was to conduct workshops and make a recommendation as to the appropriate ratemaking treatment 
thus far  parties to the idaho case have participated in two workshops in november and one in february without reaching resolution 
thus far  the matter is now set to be decided by the ipuc via the submittal of comments and briefs by the parties to the case 
a decision is anticipated by june  in  ipc sold  allowances out of a total of approximately  excess allowances for approximately million before income taxes and expenses on the open market 
through february   ipc has sold an additional  emission allowances for approximately million and plans to continue selling surplus allowances periodically as it deems prudent in light of ongoing analysis of compliance requirements and market conditions 
under the approved interim accounting treatment  ipc is recording the idaho and oregon allocated portions of the proceeds net of expenses as a regulatory liability 
at this time  ipc cannot predict the outcome of the ipuc process  or any future opuc ratemaking proceeding relating to this issue  or how the proceeds might ultimately be allocated between retail customers and shareholders 
integrated resource plan ipc filed its irp with the ipuc and the opuc in august the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next ten years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the two primary goals of the irp were to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
in addition  there were two secondary goals to give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures and to involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
the irp is filed every two years with both the ipuc and the opuc 
prior to filing  the irp requires extensive involvement by ipc  the ipuc staff and the opuc staff  as well as customer  technological and environmental representatives and is the starting point for demonstrating prudence in ipc s resource decisions 
the ipuc accepted the irp on april  the opuc acknowledged the irp on june  the irp includes the following elements mw demand response programs  mw energy efficiency programs  mw geothermal powered generation  mw combined heat and power at customer facilities  mw combustion turbine  distributed generation or market purchases  mw coal fired generation  mw wind powered generation  and mw simple cycle natural gas fired combustion turbine peaking resource 
the irp identified specific actions to be taken by ipc prior to the next irp in ipc is in the process of implementing these actions 
during december of  ipc issued two requests for proposal rfps associated with an air conditioning cycling program 
during  ipc continued implementation of the irp action plan 
a draft rfp for mw of geothermal powered generation was released on january  due to a purpa developer s interest in constructing a large cogeneration project in ipc s service territory  ipc has decided to suspend any further action on the mw combined heat and power rfp 
coal fired resource screening and evaluation in the irp  ipc identified the need for seasonal ownership of a coal fired resource beginning in the irp s near term action plan noted that during ipc would attempt to identify a utility partner for this resource and that in ipc would issue an rfp for the coal fired resource 
as a result of discussions with potential resource participants  ipc and spokane  washington based avista utilities have entered into an agreement to jointly investigate possible future coal fired resources 
under the arrangement  the utilities will be studying the options for base load coal fired generation to meet their collective irp forecast needs 
wind rfp an rfp for mw of wind powered generation was issued on january  the rfp requested deliveries of energy from approximately mw of wind powered generation commencing no later than the end of and deliveries of energy from all mw commencing no later than the end of final bids were due on march  the selection committee compiled a short list of bidders then suspended further action until the ipuc could process ipc s request for a moratorium on purpa wind projects see purpa wind projects below 
in late september ipc announced that it would reactivate the rfp  although ipc now anticipates acquiring mw through the process instead of the original mw 
upon receipt of generation interconnect feasibility studies for the short listed projects  ipc will complete its evaluation of the proposals received in response to this rfp 
purpa wind projects as of january  two wind projects  with a total nameplate capacity of mw  are selling energy to ipc under approved purpa agreements 
an additional twelve wind projects  comprising mw of wind generation  have approved purpa agreements and are scheduled to come online during and the total nameplate capacity of purpa wind projects currently under contract is mw 
as a result of recent ipuc actions  ipc anticipates executing three additional purpa wind agreements that will subsequently be submitted to the ipuc for approval 
these three agreements are expected to provide an additional mw of wind powered generation 
if these agreements are signed and approved by the ipuc  the total nameplate capacity of purpa wind projects under contract will increase to mw 
on june   ipc filed an application requesting the ipuc to issue an order temporarily suspending ipc s obligation under purpa and various ipuc orders to enter into new contracts to purchase energy generated by wind powered qualifying facilities 
ipc requested the temporary suspension remain in effect until the ipuc investigates the impact on ipc s customers arising out of the addition of substantial amounts of wind powered generation projects 
ipc is concerned that the continuous absorption of additional wind resources will adversely affect ipc s overall power supply costs and system reliability 
ipc is also concerned that the apparent high price for wind purpa resources is impacting bid prices for the wind rfp 
on july   ipc submitted testimony in support of the request 
on july   the ipuc conducted a hearing on the matter and issued an order on august  reducing the maximum size for projects eligible to receive published avoided cost rates to kw from mw and setting grandfathering criteria for purpa wind projects in progress at the time of the order 
currently  approximately mw of proposed purpa wind projects are actively seeking contracts from ipc through the grandfathering criteria or via negotiated purpa agreements 
the outcome of these agreement requests is unknown at this time 
peaking resource rfp on january   ipc selected a siemens westinghouse combustion turbine project in response to a rfp for construction of a natural gas fired power plant  as identified in the irp 
ipc sought bids for the construction of a turnkey generating facility to expand its generation capabilities during peak times when electricity supplies are low  electricity import capabilities are reduced due to transmission constraints  or wholesale energy costs are high 
the plant is planned to be on line prior to the summer of the proposal selected is for a siemens westinghouse sgt f combustion turbine located at the evander andrews power complex near mountain home  idaho 
the unit will provide approximately mw of capacity to help meet summer load peaks and can provide greater capacity during cooler times of the year 
the siemens westinghouse contract value is expected to be between million following contract negotiations 
ipc plans to submit an application to the ipuc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity before proceeding with the project 
irp preparation has begun on the irp with the initial meeting of the irp advisory council held on october   and meetings are continuing on a monthly basis 
the planning period will change from a ten year forecast to a year forecast 
the irp is scheduled to be filed in june advanced meter reading on february   the ipuc issued order no 
 which directed ipc to submit a plan no later than march  to replace its existing meters with advanced meters that are capable of both automated meter reading and time of use pricing 
on april   the ipuc issued order no 
 which modified and clarified order no 
the requirement to commence installation in was removed  however  ipc was expected to implement advanced meter reading as soon as practicable  subject to updated analysis showing advanced meter reading to be cost effective for customers 
as ordered by the ipuc  ipc submitted an updated analysis on may  a workshop with the ipuc staff and other interested parties to discuss the analysis was held on may  the ipuc issued order no 
on july   providing interested parties the opportunity to submit comments regarding ipc s updated analysis 
on october   the ipuc issued order no 
 which directed ipc to collaboratively develop and submit a phase one advanced meter reading implementation plan to replace current residential meters with advanced meters in selected service areas 
ipc complied with this order on december  by filing a phase one implementation plan that targeted the emmett  idaho and mccall  idaho areas for installation and implementation 
phase one is projected to cost million and ipc included the costs in its idaho general rate case 
since april  approximately  advanced meters have been installed 
ipc submitted a report to the ipuc in december summarizing the advanced meter reading project and associated benefits and costs 
the ipuc has opened a comment period extending to april  regarding the report 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
ipc recently received new licenses for five of its middle snake river projects and the malad project 
ipc s hydroelectric project license for the hells canyon complex expired at the end of july and the swan falls project license will expire in ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of these projects  a process that may continue for the next ten to fifteen years 
middle snake river projects ipc s middle snake river projects consist of the bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls  shoshone falls and cj strike projects 
on august   ipc received the ferc license orders for each of the middle snake river projects 
each license is for a year duration effective august  a central component of each license order is a settlement agreement between ipc and the us fish and wildlife service regarding five snail species that inhabit the middle snake river  which are listed as threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act esa 
as a basis for the settlement  ipc and the us fish and wildlife service agreed that additional studies and analyses are needed in order to accurately assess the effect  if any  that the middle snake river projects may have on one or more of the listed snail species 
the settlement agreement provides an operational regime for the five projects that will permit six years of studies and analyses of various project operations on the listed snail species  while providing interim protection of the listed species 
the study began in after the studies are complete  ipc  in consultation with the us fish and wildlife service  will develop a plan that addresses project operation and the protection of listed snails for the remainder of the new license terms 
on september   two conservation groups  american rivers and idaho rivers united  filed petitions for rehearing of the orders issuing the licenses for the middle snake river projects 
these petitions ask the ferc to vacate the licensing orders and request a determination from the us fish and wildlife service that the middle snake river projects jeopardize the listed snail species 
on october   the ferc issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration to provide additional time to consider the matters raised by the rehearing requests 
on march   the ferc issued an order denying the conservation groups rehearing request 
on april   american rivers and idaho rivers united appealed this order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
ipc filed a motion to intervene in the appeal and the us fish and wildlife service filed a motion to be designated a respondent intervenor 
on june   the court granted these motions 
by order dated october   the court extended the briefing schedule in the appeal 
pursuant to the extended schedule  american rivers and idaho rivers united filed their briefs with the court on october  and the ferc filed its brief on december  ipc s and fish and wildlife s briefs were filed on january  american rivers and idaho rivers united filed a reply brief and supplemental record on february  several of the new license articles for the middle snake river projects required ipc to file additional information with the ferc either upon license issuance or within  or days following license issuance 
ipc has made these required filings 
many of the new license articles require ipc to develop comprehensive plans for protection  mitigation and enhancement pm e measures and submit them to the ferc for approval 
the plans were due within six months to one year following license issuance and were required to have detailed costs  schedules and methods for implementing the pm e measures 
ipc has submitted these plans to the ferc 
plans for each license include white sturgeon conservation  recreation management  middle snake river and cj strike wildlife management area land management  minimum and aesthetic water flows  water quality monitoring  historic properties management  spring habitat protection  fish stocking and operational compliance monitoring 
cost estimates for the plans to implement required pm e measures are million in capital and million in additional annual operation and maintenance expense 
most of the capital expenditures will occur within the first five years of the licenses 
since the plans have not yet been accepted by the ferc  the cost estimates are preliminary 
additionally  cost estimates do not include any pm e measures that may be required as a result of the settlement agreement snail studies and analysis described above 
at december   million of middle snake river project relicensing and compliance costs were in electric plant in service 
the majority of these costs  which were incurred prior to the completion of ipc s idaho general rate case  were approved for recovery in rates 
costs incurred since the general rate case are included in the general rate case filing 
future costs related to the new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
malad project on march   ipc received a new year operating license for the malad project 
the new license was effective march  and includes license article requirements to address project operations  minimum flow to benefit aquatic species  esa snail protection and monitoring  habitat enhancements  fish passage  recreation enhancements and historic properties 
ipc has developed project plans  schedules and cost estimates for each article  the last of which will be filed with the ferc by march cost estimates for the plans to implement required pm e measures are million in capital and million in additional annual operation and maintenance expense 
most of the capital expenditures will occur within the first five years of the license 
a fish passage plan  to be filed by march   includes a lower diversion fish ladder 
if the plan is approved  construction will commence in if the proposed fish ladder is successful in addressing intended environmental issues  then a second fish passage structure will be built 
a second structure will result in additional capital expenditure of approximately million sometime during the timeframe 
because the plans have not yet been accepted by the ferc  the cost estimates are preliminary 
at december   million of malad project relicensing costs were included in electric plant in service and are included in the idaho general rate case filing 
future costs related to the new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
the current license for the hells canyon complex expired at the end of july ipc now operates the project under an annual license issued by the ferc until the new multi year license is issued 
ipc developed the license application for the hells canyon complex through a collaborative process involving representatives of state and federal agencies and business  environmental  tribal  customer  local government and local landowner interests 
the license application was filed in july and accepted by the ferc for filing in december the license application includes the continuation of existing  as well as proposed new measures intended to protect  mitigate and enhance fish and wildlife  protect recreational opportunities and preserve other aspects of environmental quality 
the estimated costs of these pm e measures are approximately million in the first five years of a license and million over the following years  for a total estimated cost of million over a year license 
these cost estimates do not include estimated costs of proposed water quality measures included in the license application 
these measures are the subject of ongoing state processes under section of the clean water act 
ipc estimates that costs associated with these water quality measures may result in an additional cost of million  for a total estimated cost of million 
these estimated costs could increase as a result of the licensing process as the fpa requires that the ferc consider  and include in the license  conditions to ensure that the project is consistent with the comprehensive development of the water resource for the improvement and utilization of hydropower development  and for the adequate protection  mitigation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources and other beneficial public uses 
the conditions included in the final license may include mandatory conditions and prescriptions proposed by federal agencies 
under the fpa  some federal agencies have mandatory conditioning authority 
section of the fpa provides the departments of commerce and the interior with authority to require fishways  or passage facilities  to allow fish to migrate below and above a project 
section e allows federal agencies with jurisdiction over a federal reservation  such as a national forest or park that is occupied by a licensed project  to require the ferc to include in the license such conditions and prescriptions that the federal agency considers necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of that reservation 
the ferc must include in the license those conditions and prescriptions proposed by these agencies  which fall within that agency s conditioning authority  under the fpa 
these conditions and prescriptions  however  must be supported by substantial evidence and otherwise be in compliance with the provisions of the energy act 
if they are not  a federal appeals court may set the conditions and prescriptions aside 
in other words  the agencies have the authority to require actions to be included in a license to protect resources or address issues under their jurisdiction 
as such  the actual costs of the pm e measures associated with the relicensing of the hells canyon complex will not be known until after the new license is issued by the ferc 
in response to the filing of the license application in july  federal and state agencies  native american indian tribes and other participants in the hells canyon complex relicensing process filed initial comments to the license application  some of which contained additional proposed pm e measures 
ipc s initial estimate of the potential cost of the measures proposed in these initial comments  assuming all of the proposed measures were included as conditions in a final license  which ipc believes is unlikely  totaled more than billion over a period up to years 
ipc s preliminary estimate is that this would result in an approximate to percent increase to existing base rates 
these cost estimates  however  are preliminary as federal  state  tribal and private parties participating in the relicensing proceeding are not required to file their final comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions with the ferc until later in the relicensing process 
the ferc has recently issued its notice of ready for environmental analysis nrea  which requires the agencies  tribes and other participants in the relicensing process to file preliminary comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions under the fpa  the national environmental policy act of  as amended nepa  the energy policy act of and other applicable federal laws 
these preliminary recommendations  conditions  and prescriptions will be processed as part of the licensing and nepa process outlined below  and when filed with the ferc  will provide ipc with a better indicator of the type and nature of pm e measures that may be included in final license 
when the comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions become final  the ferc will consider them and include those conditions in the final license that the ferc determines are necessary and required to protect  mitigate and enhance those resources affected by the operation and management of the project  including any mandatory conditions or prescriptions proposed under sections e or of the fpa 
at december   million of hells canyon complex relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license  as discussed above  will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
nepa process nepa requires that the ferc independently evaluate the environmental effects of relicensing the hells canyon complex as proposed under the final license application the proposed action and also consider reasonable alternatives to the proposed action 
consistent with the requirements of nepa  the ferc staff will prepare an environmental impact statement for the hells canyon project  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the environmental impact statement will describe and evaluate the probable effects  if any  of the proposed action and the other alternatives considered 
as part of the nepa process  the ferc initiated a scoping process to support preparation of the environmental impact statement and help ensure that all pertinent issues are identified and analyzed 
on october   the ferc issued scoping document to provide interested parties with information on the relicensing of the project and solicit comments and suggestions for a preliminary list of issues and alternatives that might be addressed in the environmental impact statement 
the ferc also held four scoping meetings in the fall and winter of to offer parties the opportunity for input on the scope of the environmental impact statement 
based upon comments and information received in response to scoping document  on november   the ferc staff issued scoping document  which provides for a tentative schedule for the environmental impact statement preparation including the filing of additional information 
subsequent to the issuance of scoping document  ipc and a number of other parties participating in the ferc licensing process requested that the ferc revise the tentative schedule to enable the parties to pursue comprehensive settlement discussions in an effort to reach agreement for the relicensing of the hells canyon complex 
see consultation settlement process discussion below to facilitate settlement efforts  the ferc extended the nepa schedule  delaying the issuance of the nrea until the fall of the ferc issued the nrea on october  federal and state agencies  native american indian tribes and other participants in the relicensing process filed preliminary comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions with the ferc in january reply comments by ipc  or other participants in the process  are to be filed by april  the ferc will consider these filings as required by the fpa and nepa and under its current schedule will issue a draft environmental impact statement in july and a final environmental impact statement in january consultation settlement process in an effort to resolve issues associated with the relicensing of the hells canyon complex  ipc has been engaged in discussions with the ferc and relevant federal and state agencies on the effects  if any  of the relicensing of the project on species listed as threatened or endangered under the esa 
the national marine fisheries service listed snake river sockeye as endangered in  snake river spring  summer and fall chinook as threatened in and snake river steelhead as threatened in in june  the us fish and wildlife service also listed bull trout in the columbia and klamath river basins as threatened 
from to  discussions with the national marine fisheries service and other federal  state and tribal interests on issues associated with the effect of the hells canyon complex operations on esa listed species and aquatic resources below the hells canyon complex were in the context of the snake river basin adjudication mediation process 
in july  the ferc requested formal consultation with the national marine fisheries service regarding the effects of interim hells canyon complex operations on esa listed species and issued a notice to all interested parties of an esa consultation meeting on september  to discuss how to proceed with consultation  including how to integrate the ongoing hells canyon complex relicensing settlement discussion into the consultation process 
on september   ipc submitted a letter to the ferc regarding the september  consultation meeting  advising that ipc  the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service had explored opportunities to address esa issues associated with the interim operations and the relicensing of the hells canyon complex through a negotiated settlement process 
at the september  meeting  ipc  the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service discussed a proposed settlement process with the ferc staff and other interested parties in attendance 
at the conclusion of that meeting  the parties  with the concurrence of the ferc staff  expressed an interest in engaging in additional discussions intended to reach agreement on an organizational structure for implementing the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process 
in late september  ipc  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service and other parties  including the states of idaho and oregon  the us forest service  several native american indian tribes  american rivers  idaho rivers united  and idaho irrigation and industrial entities interested in the relicensing of the hells canyon complex met to continue discussions relative to the initiation of the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process 
as a result of that meeting  the parties established a hells canyon complex settlement process in the fall of  which included a settlement working group  a facilitator and separated ferc staff 
the initial objective of the settlement working group was to address interim operations and issues related to aquatic species listed under the esa 
the primary objective of the settlement working group  however  was to explore opportunities to negotiate and develop a comprehensive settlement agreement to support the relicensing of the project 
the goal of the parties was to achieve an agreement in principle relative to this primary objective by september parties participating in the settlement working group included ipc  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service  the us bureau of land management  the us bureau of reclamation  the us department of agriculture forest service  the state of oregon  the state of idaho  the nez perce tribe  the shoshone paiute tribes  the shoshone bannock tribes  the burns paiute tribe  american rivers  idaho rivers united  the idaho water users association  the payette river water users association  the pioneer  settlers and nampa and meridian irrigation districts  the committee of nine  the idaho farm bureau  the columbia river inter tribal fish commission  the idaho council on industry and the environment  the j 
r 
simplot company and other industrial customers of ipc 
following expedited negotiations  on january   ipc filed an agreement on interim operations interim agreement with the ferc 
the interim agreement was executed by ipc  american rivers  idaho rivers united  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service  the us department of agriculture forest service  the us bureau of land management  the oregon departments of fish and wildlife and environmental quality  the nez perce tribe  the shoshone bannock tribes and the shoshone paiute tribes 
the interim agreement addresses issues relating to operations of the hells canyon complex and esa listed species in advance of the issuance of a new license while the parties to the settlement process participated in negotiations for a comprehensive settlement agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of the interim agreement  ipc agreed to implement certain measures until a new license is issued for the hells canyon complex including monitoring flows above the hells canyon complex to protect existing rights  the leasing and passing of certain us bureau of reclamation flow augmentation water  continuing its fall chinook plan  identifying and monitoring potential stranding sites from march through may of each year and continuing to fund its hatchery program 
ipc has also agreed to implement certain additional measures on an annual basis  provided that the parties remain engaged in settlement discussions intended to resolve long term relicensing issues including  subject to certain variables  flow augmentation to aid anadromous fish migration  the shaping of us bureau of reclamation storage water  establishing procedures to collect the data and information necessary in the relicensing settlement discussions  identifying  developing and reviewing potential structural modifications to address dissolved oxygen  total dissolved gas and seasonal water temperatures  providing water quality information to support consultations under section of the clean water act and sharing information regarding native resident and anadromous fish passage through the hells canyon complex 
the signatories agree that the measures in the interim agreement are intended to provide reasonable protection for esa listed species during the term of the interim agreement and also establish a basis for comprehensive settlement discussions to continue 
although the settlement discussions have concluded see below  ipc has agreed to implement the measures of the interim agreement through after the filing of the interim agreement with the ferc  the settlement working group  with the continuing assistance of the facilitator and separated ferc staff  commenced negotiations on the long term settlement agreement 
these negotiations continued through the fall of  but due to the number and complexity of the issues  the parties were not successful in reaching an agreement in principle for the licensing of the hells canyon complex 
because it was unlikely that the parties to the settlement process would reach agreement on a comprehensive settlement package in advance of the issuance of the nrea by the ferc in october  the settlement discussions were terminated to allow the parties the opportunity to develop comments and preliminary terms and conditions for filing with the ferc 
the parties expect to reassess opportunities for settlement in the spring of after the filings with the ferc and the proceedings provided for by the energy act have concluded 
the energy policy act of the energy act was signed into law on august  section of the energy act modifies the existing hydroelectric relicensing process under the fpa 
the energy act requires federal resource agencies with authority to impose mandatory conditions on licenses under sections e or of the fpa conditions that the ferc must include in the license  see discussion above to provide license applicants  and other parties to the licensing process  with evidentiary hearings on disputed issues of material fact related to proposed conditions 
it also requires that such agencies accept more cost effective alternative conditions proposed by license applicants  or other parties  provided that the proposed alternative conditions will be no less protective of the resource or the reservation than the original condition recommended by the agency 
pursuant to the provisions of the energy act  the departments of the interior  commerce and agriculture promulgated interim final rules on november  providing for specific procedures and time frames for implementing the evidentiary hearing provisions of the energy act and for proposing alternative conditions to the agencies 
pursuant to these rules  ipc and other parties to the licensing process must file requests for evidentiary hearings on disputed issues of material fact and proposed alternative conditions within days of the agency s filing of their preliminary terms and conditions 
ipc filed requests for hearing on february  within days thereafter  the agencies must respond to the hearing requests and the evidentiary hearings are to be held within days thereafter 
ipc is now preparing for the proceedings contemplated by the energy act 
swan falls project the license for the swan falls hydroelectric project expires in on march   ipc initiated formal consultation with agencies  native american tribes and the public regarding the relicensing of the swan falls project 
this was done by providing interested stakeholders with detailed information on the swan falls project 
in addition  a site tour and meeting for interested stakeholders was held on may  ipc is in the process of compiling information and performing studies in preparation for filing an application for a new license with the ferc in at december   million of swan falls project relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
regional transmission organizations in december  the ferc  in order no 
 encouraged all companies with transmission assets to form regional transmission organizations rtos 
by encouraging the formation of rtos  the ferc sought to further facilitate the formation of efficient  competitive wholesale electricity markets 
in response  several northwest utilities  including ipc  attempted formation of an rto called rto west  which eventually evolved into grid west  a transmission management entity that would not necessarily become an rto 
in july  the ferc acknowledged that grid west would not need to satisfy their rto requirements  but did acknowledge that the grid west governance was sufficiently independent to satisfy the independence requirements of an rto 
by september  the grid west technical design was complete and the process was begun to commit the necessary funding to transfer corporate control to a new independent governing board and provide for continued development 
since then  two major funding entities  the bonneville power administration and the british columbia transmission corporation  have declared they are unable to commit to this developmental funding 
recently  grid west has developed a plan to accelerate development and provide limited near term services at a potentially much lower cost than the original proposal 
the remaining utilities are now in the process of deciding whether to fund the next stages of development on the basis of this new plan 
ipc has spent funds supporting the development of grid west  and expects to continue funding as long as grid west remains viable and ipc remains a participating utility 
funding of this effort has taken two forms 
first  funds have been loaned to grid west for the purpose of meeting its developmental expenses 
the total accumulated loan through the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
ipc expects this loan to be repaid by grid west when it commences operation 
second  ipc has incurred incremental internal costs from participating in the developmental effort  which are mostly related to incremental travel and legal consultation 
prior to  ipc had accumulated these costs in a deferred expense account 
the total accumulated internal expense through the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
in recognition of grid west s decision at the end of to take a significant first step toward operation  ipc decided that  beginning in  all additional incremental costs related to grid west development activities would be expensed rather than deferred 
at this time  ipc expects to pursue recovery of the accumulated internal costs through rates 
ferc market based rate authority ipc has ferc approved market based rate authority  which permits ipc to sell electric energy at market based rates rather than cost based rates 
every three years  the ferc requires a review of the conditions under which this market based rate authority is granted to ensure that the rates charged thereunder are just and reasonable 
on april   the ferc issued an order commencing a market power analysis of all companies with market based rate authority  including ipc 
in september  ipc filed a revision of its market power analysis based on data  which it supplemented in september and october on march   the ferc issued an order accepting ipc s market power analysis 
ipc is required to file another market power analysis on or before march  on may  ipc filed a notice of change in status in accordance with ferc requirements to report the addition of bennett mountain power plant  which ipc acquired on march  the purpose of the filing is to explain whether  and if so  how  the addition of bennett mountain reflects a departure from the characteristics the ferc relied on when it authorized ipc to make sales at market based rates 
the may filing included an updated generation market power study that utilized original data as well as pertinent data 
the results showed that  with the addition of bennett mountain  ipc still passed both of the ferc s market power screens in all relevant control areas 
on december   the ferc staff requested that ipc perform a complete generation market power study for the ipc control area using data 
ipc has completed the study and is awaiting a response from the ferc 
other matters adopted accounting pronouncements fin r in january  idacorp and ipc adopted fin r  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or more of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders  the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a 
the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  c 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  and the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
idacorp and ipc evaluated their investments  contracts and other potential variable interests that would be subject to the provisions of fin r  and idacorp determined that it must consolidate two entities under those provisions 
at adoption  total assets and liabilities each increased by million and consisted primarily of property and long term debt 
cash flows of the newly consolidated entities are included on idacorp s consolidated statement of cash flows from the date of adoption 
net income was not affected by the adoption of the interpretation 
fin in  idacorp and ipc adopted fin this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation aro as used in fasb statement no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional aro if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional aro should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional aro should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fas acknowledges that  in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an aro 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an aro 
fin became effective december  after reviewing the provisions of fin  no additional aro s were identified at ipc 
one aro was identified at idacomm 
upon adoption  idacomm recorded an aro liability of million and a related asset of million 
new accounting pronouncements see note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
inflation idacorp and ipc believe that inflation has caused and will continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance costs and capital improvements 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or ipc s operations  costs for products and services are subject to increases 
ipc is subject to rate of return regulation and the impact of inflation on the level of cost recovery under regulation 
increases in utility costs and expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity though a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highlyrated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in floating rate debt  net of temporary investments 
assuming no change in either company s financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for both idacorp and ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate  and therefore do not expose idacorp or ipc to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and price of production 
the objective of ipc s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
ipc s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed pca mechanism 
ipc has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
ipc s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idacorp board of directors  and to the cag 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan and orders risk mitigating actions dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
ipc representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
energy as part of the sale of ie s forward book of electricity trading contracts  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with sempra energy trading guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
in  under the terms of the guarantee  ie made million in margin deposits 
ie expects this amount to be refunded no later than the end of the guarantee in the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fin and did not have a significant effect on idacorp s financial statements 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
