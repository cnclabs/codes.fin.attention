table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of continuing operations executive overview company overview we are a leading regional wireless and broadband telecommunications service provider serving approximately million wireless customers and approximately  access line equivalents in markets covering over million net pops in the united states and the neighboring caribbean 
in the united states  we are a regional wireless service provider in small cities and rural areas in two geographic clusters covering parts of six states in the midwest and southeast 
in our puerto rico based caribbean service area  which also includes operations in the dominican republic and the us virgin islands  we are a facilities based  fully integrated communications service provider offering both wireless and  in puerto rico and the dominican republic  broadband services to business and residential customers 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
please see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of management s summary our vision is to be the premier regional provider of telecommunications services  by tailoring the ultimate customer experience in the markets we serve 
we deliver our tailored approach to serving local markets through our local scale and knowledge  which has led to a strong track record of success 
in the united states  we provide digital wireless service in two geographic clusters  covering approximately million net pops 
our midwest cluster includes parts of indiana  michigan and ohio  and our southeast cluster includes parts of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
our clusters are comprised of small cities and rural areas 
in the caribbean region  we offer wireless and broadband communications services in puerto rico and the dominican republic and wireless services in the us virgin islands 
for the fiscal year ended may   we derived approximately of our caribbean operations revenue from our puerto rico operations 
puerto rico is a us dollar denominated and fcc regulated commonwealth of the united states 
san juan  the capital of puerto rico  is currently one of the largest and most dense us wireless markets in terms of population 
the business strategy we use to tailor the ultimate customer experience entails focusing on attractive and growing markets and customizing our sales  marketing and customer support functions to customer needs in these markets 
for the fiscal year ended may   approximately of our wireless sales in the united states and puerto rico and substantially all of our broadband sales were made through our own employees  which allows us to have a high degree of control over the customer experience 
we use this control to deliver an experience that we believe is unique and valued by the customers in our various markets 
further  through our tailored approach  we target high quality high arpu postpaid wireless customers in our us and puerto rico operations 
our capital expenditures for fiscal were as follows fiscal year ended of total capital may  expenditures dollar amounts in thousands us wireless caribbean wireless caribbean broadband total capital expenditures capitalized phones in puerto rico included above in caribbean wireless property  plant and equipment  net at may  
table of contents our business strategy also requires that our networks are of the highest quality in all our locations 
capital expenditures for our us wireless operations were used to expand our coverage areas and upgrade our cell sites and call switching equipment of existing wireless properties and continue to build out our newly acquired spectrum in grand rapids and lansing  michigan 
in the caribbean  these investments were used to add capacity and services  to continue the development and expansion of our caribbean wireless systems  to complete the replacement and upgrade of our puerto rico wireless and us virgin islands wireless network and to continue the expansion of our caribbean broadband network infrastructure 
in our puerto rico wireless operations  we sell or loan phones to our customers 
when we sell a phone to a customer  the cost of the phone sold is charged to cost of equipment sold  whereas the cost of a phone we loan to a customer is recorded as an asset within property  plant and equipment and is charged to depreciation expense over the life of the phone 
we believe that the success of our business is a function of our performance relative to a number of key drivers 
the drivers can be summarized in our ability to attract and retain customers by profitably providing superior service at competitive rates 
we continually monitor our performance against these key drivers by evaluating several metrics 
in addition to adjusted operating income adjusted operating income represents the profitability measure of our segments see note to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliation to the appropriate generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap measure  the following key metrics  among other factors  are monitored by management in assessing the performance of our business gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions net gain loss wireless subscribers arpu including roaming revenue roaming revenue penetration total wireless postpaid churn wireless prepaid churn caribbean wireless average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer data revenue per average wireless subscriber fiber route miles caribbean broadband switched access lines caribbean broadband dedicated access line equivalents caribbean broadband on net buildings caribbean broadband capital expenditures gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions represent the number of new subscribers we are able to add during the period 
growing our subscriber base by adding new subscribers is a fundamental element of our long term growth strategy 
we must maintain a competitive offering of products and services to sustain our subscriber growth 
we focus on postpaid customers in our us and puerto rico operations and prepaid in the dominican republic 
net gain loss wireless subscribers represents the number of subscribers we were able to add to our service during the period after deducting the number of disconnected or terminated subscribers 
by monitoring our growth against our forecast  we believe we are better able to anticipate our future operating performance 
arpu represents the average monthly subscriber revenue generated by a typical subscriber determined as subscriber revenues divided by average number of subscribers 
we monitor trends in arpu to ensure that our rate plans and promotional offerings are attractive to customers and profitable 
the majority of our revenues are derived 
table of contents from subscriber revenues 
subscriber revenues include  among other things monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  universal service fund  or usf  support payment revenues  long distance revenues derived from calls placed by our customers  international interconnect revenues  roaming revenue  and other charges such as activation  voice mail  call waiting  call forwarding and regulatory charges 
roaming revenues represent the amount of revenue we receive from other wireless carriers for providing service to their subscribers who roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by an agreement between the roamer s wireless provider and us 
the amount of roaming revenue we generate is often dependent upon usage patterns of our roaming partners subscribers and the rate plan mix and technology mix of our roaming partners 
we closely monitor trends in roaming revenues because usage patterns by our roaming partners subscribers can be difficult to predict 
penetration total wireless represents a percentage  which is calculated by dividing the number of our subscribers by the total population of potential subscribers available in the markets that we serve 
postpaid and prepaid churn represent the number of subscribers that disconnect or are terminated from our service or where there is a lack of usage by prepaid customers for a prescribed period of time 
churn is calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who cancel service during each month in a period by the total number of wireless subscribers as of the beginning of the month 
churn is stated as the average monthly churn rate for the applicable period 
we monitor and seek to control churn so that we can grow our business without incurring significant sales and marketing cost needed to replace disconnected subscribers 
we must continue to ensure that we offer excellent network quality and customer service so that our churn rates remain low 
average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer represents the average number of minutes mous used by our customers during a period 
we monitor growth in mous to ensure that the access and overage charges we are collecting are consistent with that growth 
in addition  growth in subscriber usage may indicate a need to invest in additional network capacity 
data revenue per average wireless subscriber represents the portion of arpu generated by our subscribers using data services such as text messaging  wireless internet browsing  wireless email  instant messaging  multi media messaging and the ability to download content and applications 
fiber route miles are the number of miles of fiber cable that we have laid 
fiber is installed to connect our equipment to our customer premises equipment 
as a facilities based carrier  the number of fiber route miles is an indicator of the strength of our network  our coverage and our potential market opportunity 
switched access lines represent the number of lines connected to our switching center and serving customers for incoming and outgoing calls 
growing our switched access lines is a fundamental element of our strategy 
we monitor the trends in our switched access line growth against our forecast to be able to anticipate future operating performance 
in addition  this measurement allows us to compute our current market penetration in the markets we serve 
dedicated access line equivalents represents the amount of voice grade equivalent  or vge  lines used to connect two end points 
we monitor the trends in our dedicated service using vge against our forecast to anticipate future operating performance  network capacity requirements and overall growth of our business 
on net buildings are locations where we have established a point of presence to serve one or more customers 
tracking the number of on net buildings allows us to size our addressable market and determine the appropriate level of capital expenditures 
as a facilities based broadband operator  it is a critical performance measurement of our growth and a clear indication of our increased footprint 
capital expenditures represent the amount spent on upgrades  additions and improvements to our telecommunications network and back office infrastructure 
we monitor our capital expenditures as part of our overall financing plan and to ensure that we receive an appropriate rate of return on our capital investments 
this statistic is also used to ensure that capital investments are in line with network usage trends and consistent with our objective of offering a high quality network to our customers 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which result from our customers not making required payments 
we base our allowance on the likelihood of recoverability of our subscriber accounts receivable based on past experience and by reviewing current collection trends 
a worsening of economic or industry trends beyond our estimates could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
property  plant and equipment depreciation the telecommunications industry is capital intensive 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment constitutes a substantial operating cost for us 
the cost of our property  plant and equipment  principally telecommunications equipment  is charged to depreciation expense over estimated useful lives 
we depreciate our telecommunications equipment using the straight line method over its estimated useful lives 
we periodically review changes in our technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity and salvage values to determine adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
actual economic lives may differ from our estimated useful lives as a result of changes in technology  market conditions and other factors 
such changes could result in a change in our depreciable lives and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our estimation of fair value  we consider current market values of properties similar to our own  competition  prevailing economic conditions  government policy  including taxation  and the historical and current growth patterns of both our business and the industry 
we also consider the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets based on a comparison of estimated undiscounted operating cash flows for the related businesses with the carrying value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate the fair value of and impairment  if any  of our assets 
these estimates are very subjective in nature  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
estimates related to recoverability of assets are critical accounting policies as management must make assumptions about future revenue and related expenses over the life of an asset  and the effect of recognizing impairment could be material to our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
actual revenue and costs could vary significantly from such estimates 
goodwill and wireless licenses valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and wireless licenses for impairment based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with 
table of contents sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of january st or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have determined that our reporting units for sfas are our operating segments determined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future cash flows from each reporting unit to determine whether its estimated value exceeds its carrying value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  time horizons of cash flow forecasts  assumed terminal value  estimates of our future cost structures and anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
these projections are very subjective in nature 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model eg  growth rates  future economic conditions or discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of the reporting unit are subjective and could result in different values and may affect any related goodwill or wireless licenses impairment charge 
we performed our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis during the fiscal year ended may  based on the analysis performed in accordance with sfas  we recorded no impairment charge during fiscal income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the computation of income taxes is subject to estimation due to the significant judgment required with respect to the tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
our income tax provision is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is used to evaluate our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable that we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves as facts and circumstances change 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  while other differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 

table of contents we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is determined that actual results will differ from our estimates 
the income tax provision reflects tax law and rate changes in the period such changes are enacted

revenue 
us wireless service revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the fiscal year ended may  the increase was primarily due to an increase in recurring access fees due to increased subscribers  increased revenue from enhancement features and increased data revenue short messaging service  or sms  multi media messaging service  or mms  and downloads 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in airtime revenues and lower revenues associated with amounts charged to our customers for roaming on other carriers networks 
us wireless roaming revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may  the increase was primarily due to increased roaming minutes  partially offset by a lower average rate per minute 
we expect us wireless roaming revenue to decline approximately million during fiscal our us wireless operations had approximately  and  subscribers at may  and may   respectively  which included  and  respectively  of wholesale subscribers 
wholesale subscribers are customers who use our network and services but are billed by a third party reseller who has effectively resold our services to the end user 
postpaid subscribers accounted for of total us wireless retail subscribers as of may  during the twelve months ended may   increases from new activations of  were offset by subscriber cancellations of  the cancellations experienced by the us wireless operations were primarily due to competition and nonpayment 
the monthly postpaid churn rate was for the fiscal year ended may  as compared to for the fiscal year ended may  the decrease in churn was primarily due to retention efforts and our continued effort to convert our remaining tdma customers to gsm  which generally requires subscribers to sign new two year contracts 
equipment sales increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the fiscal year ended may   due primarily to a increase in activations over that period  higher revenue per phone due to more technologically advanced phones being sold and revenues received from deductibles under our phone insurance program

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal arpu excluding the million of usf revenue was for the fiscal year ended may  average mous per subscriber were for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to minutes for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in wireless arpu was primarily due to the aforementioned increases in roaming revenue  service revenue and equipment sales  driven by an increase in the number of subscribers on gsm blue region plans various plans with expanded local calling areas to include contiguous states  which generally have a higher arpu 
costs and expenses 
cost of services increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to costs associated with an approximate increase in mous  including higher incollect roaming costs costs associated with providing our subscribers roaming on other carriers networks and interconnection costs 
in addition  the increase was due to increased tower site rent associated with additional sites primarily in grand rapids and lansing  michigan  phone repair expense  property taxes and data expenses 
average incollect roaming costs per subscriber were per month for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to per month for the same period a year ago 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers on gsm blue region plans in fiscal as compared to fiscal the gsm blue region subscribers used more mous in total  and a greater percentage of the mous used were off network 
in addition  the displacement of our subscribers due to hurricanes caused an increase in off network minutes in the southeast 
our average off network mous per subscriber was in fiscal as compared with in fiscal cost of equipment sold increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased gsm handset upgrades in support of customer retention and an increase in customer activations

caribbean wireless arpu was for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for fiscal the decrease in arpu was primarily due to a continued change in the subscriber mix as the percentage of total caribbean subscribers from the dominican republic has continued to increase 
the majority of the subscribers in the dominican republic are prepaid subscribers  who generally have a lower arpu than postpaid subscribers 
additionally  caribbean wireless arpu declined as a result of an increase in the number of companion plans in our subscriber base and lower airtime revenue per subscriber as a result of the company offering rate plans with larger buckets of minutes at the same cost 
our subscribers used an average of mous during the fiscal year ended may  compared to mous during the fiscal year ended may  the decrease in mous was primarily due to the change in the subscriber mix described above  as prepaid subscribers generally use less mous than our postpaid subscribers 
our postpaid subscribers used an average of  minutes of airtime per month during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to  minutes of use per month during the fiscal year ended may  equipment sales increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year  primarily due to an increase in the number of phones sold  as well as an increase in average revenue per phone  which results from increased sales of more technologically advanced handsets capable of supplying advanced wireless data services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial derivatives are used as part of the overall risk management strategy 
these instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
the portfolio of derivative financial instruments has consisted of interest rate swap and collar agreements 
interest rate swap agreements were used to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations  thereby reducing the exposure to higher interest rates 
interest rate collar agreements were used to lock in a maximum rate if interest rates rise  but allow the company to otherwise pay lower market rates  subject to a floor 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and the risk management objective and strategy for each hedge transaction 
amounts paid or received under interest rate swap and collar agreements were accrued as interest rates change with the offset recorded in interest expense
