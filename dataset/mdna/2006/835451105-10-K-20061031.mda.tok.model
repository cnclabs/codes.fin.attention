item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business 
sonic operates and franchises the largest chain of drive ins in the united states 
as of august   the sonic system was comprised of  drive ins  of which or were partner drive ins and or  were franchise drive ins 
sonic drive ins feature signature menu items such as specialty soft drinks and frozen desserts  made to order sandwiches and a unique breakfast menu 
we derive our revenues primarily from partner drive in sales and royalties from franchisees 
we also receive revenues from initial franchise fees 
to a lesser extent  we also receive income from the selling and leasing of signs and real estate  as well as from minority ownership interests in a few franchise drive ins 
costs of partner drive in sales  including minority interest in earnings of drive ins  relate directly to partner drive in sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to the company s franchising operations  as well as partner drive in operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of partner drive ins 
our revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses also are affected by the number and sales volumes of franchise drive ins 
initial franchise fees and franchise royalties are directly affected by the number of franchise drive in openings 
overview of business performance 
business performance was strong during fiscal year as net income increased and earnings per share increased to per diluted share from per diluted share in the year earlier period  which is adjusted for the retrospective adoption of sfas r for expensing stock based compensation 
we continue to experience considerable momentum in our business fueled by strong growth in same store sales that led to a strong increase in system wide drive in level average profits 
in turn  the rise in store level profits  which have grown handsomely over the last three years  helped produce a solid number of new drive in openings by franchisees 
we believe these results reflect our multi layered growth strategy that features the following components solid same store sales growth  expansion of the sonic brand through new unit growth  particularly by franchisees  increased franchising income stemming from franchisee new unit growth  solid same store sales growth and our unique ascending royalty rate  operating leverage at both the drive in level and the corporate level  and the use of excess operating cash flow and issuance of new debt for franchise acquisitions and share repurchases 
the following table provides information regarding the number of partner drive ins and franchise drive ins in operation as of the end of the periods indicated as well as the system wide growth in sales and average unit volume 
system wide information includes both partner drive in and franchise drive in information  which we believe is useful in analyzing the growth of the brand as well as the company s revenues since franchisees pay royalties based on a percentage of sales

markets are identified based on television viewing areas and further classified as core or developing markets based upon number of drive ins in a market and the level of advertising support 
market classifications are updated periodically

system wide same store sales increased during fiscal year  with growth for the year in all of our non traditional day parts morning  afternoon and evening 
the average check amount average amount spent per transaction represented a larger portion of the overall sales increase than traffic growth number of transactions 
this marked our th consecutive year of positive same store sales growth 
we believe our strong sales performance is a direct consequence of our specific sales driving initiatives including  but not limited to continued growth of our business in non traditional day parts including the morning  afternoon  and evening day parts  use of technology to reach customers and improve the customer experience  monthly promotions and new product news focused on quality and expanded choice for our customers  and growth in brand awareness through increased media spending and greater use of network cable advertising 
looking forward  these strategies are expected to continue to positively impact our business 
we expect revenue growth of between and for fiscal year  based upon targeted same store sales growth in the range of to 
we continue to promote the expansion of our business in non traditional day parts morning  afternoon  and evening  which resulted in positive growth during fiscal year compared to fiscal year for each of these non traditional day parts 
we believe we have continuing opportunity to grow these day parts throughout fiscal year implementation of the pays program  which began in the fall of  was completed in the remainder of our partner drive ins during the second quarter of fiscal year under the pays program  a credit card terminal is added to each drive in stall to facilitate credit and debit card transactions 
rollout to franchise drive ins began in february and is expected to be substantially complete system wide by the end of calendar year approximately of franchise drive ins and over of drive ins system wide now have the pays system in place 
we continue to use our monthly promotions to highlight our distinctive food offerings and to feature new products 
we also use our promotions and product news to create a strong emotional link with consumers and to align closely with consumer trends for fresh ingredients  customization  menu variety and choice 
during the past year  our new product offerings showcased the breadth of our menu and emphasized the opportunity for choice at sonic 
we will continue to have new product news in the coming months  all designed to meet customers evolving taste preferences including the growing desire for fresh  quality product offerings and healthier alternatives 
during fiscal year  our total system wide media expenditures were approximately million as compared to million in fiscal year  which we believe continues to increase overall brand awareness and strengthen our share of voice relative to our competitors 
we also continued to spend approximately one half of our marketing dollars on our system wide marketing fund efforts  which are largely used for network cable television advertising  growing this area of our advertising from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we believe increased network cable advertising provides several benefits including the ability to more effectively target and better reach the cable audience  which has now surpassed broadcast networks in terms of viewership 
in addition  national cable advertising also allows us to bring additional depth to our media and expand our message beyond our traditional emphasis on a single monthly promotion 
looking forward  we expect system wide media expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal the system wide marketing fund portion will again represent approximately one half of total media expenditures for fiscal sonic opened new drive ins during fiscal year  consisting of partner drive ins and franchise drive ins  down slightly from drive in openings during fiscal year partner drive ins and franchise drive ins 
looking forward  the company expects to open to new drive ins during fiscal year  including to by franchisees 
overview of tender offer and financing transactions 
on october   we repurchased million shares of our common stock that were properly tendered and not withdrawn  at a purchase price of per share for a total purchase price of million 
we funded the repurchase of the shares of our common stock with the proceeds from new senior secured credit facilities with a syndicate of financial institutions led by banc of america securities llc and lehman brothers inc the new senior secured credit facilities consist of a million  five year revolving credit facility and a million  seven year term loan facility 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in revenues primarily relates to solid sales growth for partner drive ins and a rise in franchising income 
revenues in thousands percent increase increase year ended august  decrease decrease revenues partner drive in sales franchise revenues franchise royalties franchise fees other total revenues percent increase increase year ended august  decrease decrease revenues partner drive in sales franchise revenues franchise royalties franchise fees other total revenues the following table reflects the growth in partner drive in sales and changes in comparable drive in sales for partner drive ins

effective september   we acquired franchise drive ins located in the tennessee and kentucky markets 
this acquisition added approximately to our revenue growth during fiscal year over the past several years  we have completed the acquisition of several franchise drive ins in various markets 
these acquisitions are expected to continue to add to revenue growth and be accretive to earnings 
our acquisitions are typically focused on higher volume stores with strong store level management already in place 
in addition  the selling franchisee usually retains a significant drive in base and continues growing with us in other areas 
we view these types of acquisitions of drive ins with proven track records as a very good  lower risk use of our capital and they remain a very viable potential use of our excess cash flow in future years 
the following table reflects the growth in franchise income franchise royalties and franchise fees as well as franchise sales  average unit volumes and the number of franchise drive ins 
while we do not record franchise drive in sales as revenues  we believe this information is important in understanding our financial performance since these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchise royalties 
this information is also indicative of the financial health of our franchisees

franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million resulted from franchise drive ins same store sales growth of in fiscal year  combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate whereby royalties  as a percentage of sales  increase as sales increase 
the balance of the increase was attributable to growth in the number of franchise drive ins over the prior period 
franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million resulted from franchise drive ins same store sales growth of in fiscal year  combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate whereby royalties  as a percentage of sales  increase as sales increase 
the balance of the increase was attributable to growth in the number of franchise drive ins over the prior period 
franchise fees increased to million as franchisees opened new drive ins in both fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in franchise fee revenue resulted from the termination of area development agreements related to an initiative to strengthen the franchise development pipeline by terminating non performing agreements 
franchise fees decreased to million during fiscal as franchise drive ins opened compared to during the previous year 
looking forward  there has been a strong increase in per store profits over the last three years 
historically  strong growth in sales and profits has been a good indicator of increased franchise openings in the following years 
as of august   we had area development agreements representing approximately planned franchise drive in openings over the next few years  compared to such agreements at august  which represented approximately planned franchise drive in openings 
while the number of agreements and commitments has declined  we believe that the termination of several non performing agreements over the past year has improved the quality of our franchise pipeline 
another step that has contributed to growth of our confidence in the franchise pipeline is the recent expansion into a number of new markets  primarily located along the east and west coasts 
in the past  our market expansion has been limited to a fewer number of markets at one time  we believe the brand awareness provided by our national cable advertising efforts will support this planned expansion to a greater number of markets 
twenty three franchise drive ins were closed during fiscal year  which was an increase from the franchise drive ins closed during fiscal year most of the closings in fiscal year were the result of low sales and were spread across a broad range of markets and franchise groups 
fifteen of the fiscal year closings related primarily to two weaker franchise operators in two different markets 
we do not believe that these drive in closings are indicative of the sonic brand s success 
we have taken steps to require stronger financial qualifications of new franchisees  which we believe will significantly mitigate this type of risk 
in addition  we expect that some of these drive ins may re open under new franchisee ownership 
we anticipate to store openings by franchisees during fiscal year substantially all of these new drive ins will open under our newest form of license agreement  which contains a higher average royalty rate and initial opening fee 
as a result of these new franchise drive in openings and the continued benefit of the ascending royalty rate  we expect approximately to million in incremental franchise fees and royalties in fiscal year operating expenses 
overall  drive in cost of operations  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year minority interest in earnings of drive ins is included as a part of cost of sales  in the table below  since it is directly related to partner drive in operations 
operating margins year ended august  costs and expenses partner drive ins food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits minority interest in earnings of partner drive ins other operating expenses total partner drive in cost of operations as a percentage of partner drive in sales 
food and packaging costs decreased by percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year following a decrease of percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the improvement for fiscal year relates primarily to lower dairy costs and a favorable shift in product mix to drinks and ice cream  which have more favorable margins than other menu items 
looking forward  we anticipate that a benign commodity cost environment will result in flat to slightly favorable food and packaging costs  as a percentage of sales  on a year over year basis in fiscal year labor costs decreased by percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year after an increase of percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the improvement for fiscal year is primarily a result of leverage from higher sales volumes 
the slight increase for fiscal year resulted from staffing increases at the assistant manager level  as well as higher labor costs related to opening newly constructed stores as higher staffing levels were required for pre opening training and through the initial opening period 
the average wage rate has increased only slightly over the past year 
looking forward  wage increases are expected to be leveraged by higher volumes 
as a result  we expect labor costs to be slightly favorable  as a percentage of sales  on a year over year basis  in fiscal year minority interest  which reflects our store level partners pro rata share of earnings through our partnership program  increased by million during fiscal year  reflecting the increase in average store level profits 
during fiscal year  minority interest increased million  also reflecting the increase in average profit per store 
we continue to view the partnership program as an integral part of our culture at sonic and a large factor in the success of our business  and we are pleased that profit distributions to our partners increased during fiscal year since we expect our average store level profits to continue to grow in fiscal year  we expect minority interest to continue to increase in dollar terms 
other operating expenses increased by percentage points during fiscal year after an increase of percentage points during fiscal year leverage from higher sales partially offset increased utility costs resulting from higher energy prices in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year resulted primarily from credit card charges associated with the increase in credit card transactions stemming from the success of the pays program  as well as increased repairs and maintenance expenses resulting from a greater focus on the physical appearance of our drive ins 
looking forward  we expect other operating expenses to be flat to slightly favorable in fiscal year  as we lap over the higher costs from a year ago 
to summarize  we are expecting overall restaurant level margins to be slightly favorable during fiscal year on a year over year basis 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal year and to million during fiscal year as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year sonic adopted sfas r at the beginning of fiscal year  therefore  we are now expensing the estimated fair value of stock options over their vesting period 
we chose to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective application method  as provided for in the standard 
this method of adoption requires us to adjust all prior periods to reflect expense for the fair value of stock options that was previously only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as of august   total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock based arrangements was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information regarding our stock based compensation 
excluding stock based compensation expense  these costs increased during fiscal year and during fiscal year  both increases related primarily to increased headcount additions to support continued growth of our business 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will increase in the range of to in fiscal year and decline slightly  as a percentage of sales 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year due  in part  to additional depreciation stemming from the tennessee and kentucky acquisitions  as well as the reduction in remaining useful life for certain assets related to the retrofit of partner drive ins in the late s 
this reduction in life resulted from a re evaluation of the remaining life of such assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year due  in part  to additional depreciation stemming from the colorado acquisition in july capital expenditures during fiscal year were million  including million related to the acquisition of drive ins  and million related to the purchase of real estate in the fourth quarter 
looking forward  with approximately to million in capital expenditures planned for the year  normal depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by approximately to for the year 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
three surplus properties became impaired during fiscal year under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  a total provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the carrying costs of these assets in excess of their estimated fair values 
one partner drive in and one surplus property became impaired during fiscal year which resulted in a provision for impairment of million for carrying cost in excess of estimated fair value for the assets 
we continue to perform quarterly analyses of certain underperforming drive ins 
it is reasonably possible that the estimate of future cash flows associated with these drive ins may change in the near future resulting in the need to write down assets associated with one or more of these drive ins to fair value 
while it is impossible to predict if future write downs will occur  we do not believe that future write downs will impede our ability to continue growing earnings at a solid rate 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased in fiscal year compared to a decrease in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year resulted from increased borrowings which have been used largely to fund approximately million in share repurchases during the year and capital expenditures 
the reduction in interest expense for fiscal year was a result of strong cash flow from operations that limited borrowings  with the reduction in interest expense more than offsetting the decrease in interest income relating to the outsourcing of our partner notes to a third party financial institution in august going forward  we expect net interest expense to increase as a result of the tender offer initiated by the company in august and funded in october the resulting additional long term borrowings are expected to result in an increase in net interest expense to at least million or more depending on the level of share repurchases and acquisitions of franchise drive ins 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes remained relatively constant for fiscal year with an effective federal and state tax rate of compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year the lower rate for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from a retroactive tax law change that reinstated expired tax credits in the first quarter of fiscal year the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit on january  has negatively impacted and will continue to impact our tax rate going forward 
we expect that congress will reinstate the tax credit retroactively  as they have done in the past 
however  we are not allowed to record the benefit of this credit for qualified employees hired after december  until the legislation becomes enacted law 
we expect our tax rate to be in the range of to in fiscal year however  our tax rate may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the timing of the renewal of the work opportunity tax credit program  option exercises and dispositions by option holders and as circumstances on individual tax matters change 
financial position during fiscal year  current assets increased to million compared to million as of the end of fiscal year cash balances increased by million as a result of positive operating cash flows and current notes receivable from franchisees increased by approximately million related to short term financing for certain franchisee capital projects 
net property  equipment and capital leases increased by million as a result of capital expenditures and the tennessee and kentucky acquisition 
goodwill increased by million and other intangibles increased by million as a result of the tennessee and kentucky acquisition 
these increases combined with the increase in current assets resulted in a increase in total assets to million as of the end of fiscal year total current liabilities increased million or during fiscal year as a result of a temporary increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was partially offset by a reduction in tax liabilities due to the timing of tax payments 
the noncurrent portion of long term debt increased million or as a result of advances on the company s line of credit to fund portions of the share repurchases  capital expenditures and the tennessee and kentucky acquisition 
overall  total liabilities increased million or as a result of the items discussed above 
stockholders equity increased million or during fiscal year primarily resulting from earnings during the period of million  along with million for stock option related and other activity  offset by treasury stock repurchases during the period of million 
at the end of fiscal year  our debt to total capital ratio stood at  up from at the end of fiscal year for the months ended august   return on average stockholders equity was and return on average assets was 
liquidity and sources of capital operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization was offset by a less significant increase in operating liabilities related to the amount and timing of tax and other liability payments and a decrease in benefit from deferred income taxes 
we anticipate continuing to generate positive free cash flow going forward 
we believe free cash flow  which we define as net income plus depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense less capital expenditures  is useful in evaluating the liquidity of the company by assessing the level of funds available for share repurchases  acquisitions of franchise drive ins  and repayment of debt 
investing cash flows 
we opened newly constructed partner drive ins and acquired drive ins from franchisees during fiscal year we funded total capital additions for fiscal year of million  which included the cost of newly opened drive ins  new equipment for existing drive ins  drive ins under construction  the acquisition of franchise drive ins and real estate  and other capital expenditures  from cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our line of credit 
during fiscal year  we purchased the real estate for of the newly constructed and of the acquired drive ins 
subsequent to year end  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement to dispose of the real estate underlying the acquired drive ins at an amount roughly equal to the purchase price of the real estate 
sales of real estate relating to drive ins previously sold to franchisees are a component of cash from investing activities and totaled million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year financing cash flows 
at august  we had an agreement with a group of banks that provided us with a million line of credit expiring in july as of august   our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million at an effective borrowing rate of  as well as million in outstanding letters of credit 
subsequent to year end  the new senior secured credit facility  described further below  was used to refinance the existing line of credit and the senior unsecured notes balance of million 
as a result of the subsequent credit facility  the amount classified as a current liability is based upon the million due by the end of fiscal year under the new credit facility rather than upon amounts due under the line of credit and senior unsecured notes because the new facility was utilized to repay those obligations 
after funding of the tender offer described below  we plan to use the new revolving credit facility to finance the opening of newly constructed drive ins and other planned capital expenditures  acquisitions of existing drive ins  purchases of the company s common stock and for other general corporate purposes  as needed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
on april   the board of directors approved an increase in the company s share repurchase program from million to million and extended the program through august  pursuant to this program  the company acquired million shares at an average price of for a total cost of million during fiscal year of the amount repurchased during the year  million was repurchased after the program s extension leaving million available under the program as of august  see tender offer below 
tender offer 
on august   we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer  initially offering to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price not less than and not greater than per share  for a maximum aggregate purchase price of million 
on september   we decreased the number of shares sought in the tender offer to million  and increased the purchase price to not less than and not greater than per share 
on october   we repurchased million shares of our common stock that were properly tendered and not withdrawn  at a purchase price of per share for a total purchase price of million 
senior secured credit facilities 
we funded the repurchase of the shares of our common stock with the proceeds from new senior secured credit facilities with a syndicate of financial institutions led by banc of america securities llc and lehman brothers inc the new senior secured credit facilities consist of a million  five year revolving credit facility and a million  seven year term loan facility 
as of october   we had borrowed million under the term loan facility and no advances were outstanding under the revolving credit facility  to fund the purchase of the shares in the tender offer  as well as refinance certain of our existing indebtedness and pay related fees and expenses 
interest rate 
interest on loans under the new senior secured credit facility will be payable at per annum rates equal to in the case of the revolving credit facility  initially  libor plus basis points and adjusting over time based upon sonic s leverage ratio and in the case of the term loan facility  initially  libor plus basis points and adjusting over time based upon sonic s credit ratings with moody s investors service inc as discussed below  we expect to refinance this facility with an alternative facility that is expected to bear interest at a lower rate 
commitment fees 
we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility  starting at and adjusting over time based upon our leverage ratio 
conditions to funding 
our ability to reserve funds from the revolving credit facility is conditioned upon various customary representations and warranties being true at the time of the borrowing  and upon no event of default existing or resulting from the receipt of such finds 
security interests 
we and all of our domestic subsidiaries have granted the lenders under the new senior secured credit facility valid and perfected first priority subject to certain exceptions liens and security interests in all present and future shares of capital stock or other ownership profit interests in each of our present and future subsidiaries subject to certain limitations  all present and future property and assets  real and personal and all proceeds and products of the property and assets described in clauses and 
covenants and events of default 
the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities contains certain affirmative covenants  certain negative covenants  certain financial covenants  certain conditions and events of default that are customarily required for similar financings 
such negative covenants include limitations on liens  consolidations and mergers  indebtedness  capital expenditures  asset dispositions  sale leaseback transactions  stock repurchases  transactions with affiliates and other restrictions and limitations 
furthermore  the credit agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants such as a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
although management does not anticipate an event of default  if such an event occurred  the unpaid amounts outstanding could become immediately due and payable 
securitization 
we currently intend to refinance the new senior secured credit facilities in the near future through a securitization of our franchise and partner drive in royalties and partner drive in rental stream 
the securitization is expected to consist of a six year term asset backed securitization and a million variable funding note  and to involve the transfer of certain franchise and partner drive in assets to a bankruptcy remote vehicle 
we expect the interest rate on the securitization will be between and basis points lower than on the new senior secured credit facilities 
the final interest rate will be determined based upon final ratings that are in the process of being determined 
additional fees related to the securitization are estimated at approximately million and will be amortized over the life of the related debt 
the securitization and the refinancing of the new senior secured credit facilities are expected to occur by december  if  however  we cannot obtain the securitization on terms satisfactory to us  we expect the new senior secured credit facilities to remain in place until maturity or until an alternative refinancing can be arranged 
forward starting swap agreement 
we have entered into a forward starting swap agreement with jp morgan chase bank with a total notional amount of million 
the forward starting swap agreement was entered into to hedge part of our interest rate exposure associated with the securitized financing 
we expect to settle the forward swap agreement upon the initiation of the securitized financing 
the settlement of this forward starting swap is expected to provide us with an effective interest rate based upon a five year swap rate of plus to basis points for million of the amount financed 
the remaining term loan balance is expected to bear interest at the five year swap rate at the time the securitization is funded plus to basis points 
if the securitization is not completed for any reason  we may redesignate the forward starting swap as a hedge of future interest payments under the new senior secured credit facilities  with any ineffectiveness recorded as a charge or credit to earnings  or we could terminate the swap resulting in an immediate charge or credit to earnings 
we plan capital expenditures of approximately to million in fiscal year  excluding potential acquisitions and share repurchases 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the development of additional partner drive ins  retrofit of existing partner drive ins and other drive in level expenditures 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility 
as of august   our total cash balance of million reflected the impact of the cash generated from operating activities  borrowing activity  and capital expenditures mentioned above 
we believe that existing cash and funds generated from operations  as well as borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility  will meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
known trends  events  demands  commitments and uncertainties looking forward  the tender offer and related increase in debt and decrease in shares outstanding will impact a number of trends  including interest expense  cash used for financing activities and earnings per share 
as a result of the increase in debt  interest expense is expected to increase to at least million or more depending on the level of share repurchases and acquisitions of franchise drive ins 
sonic is currently pursuing refinancing the senior credit facilities with a securitized financing arrangement 
although we currently expect to successfully complete the securitization  if we are unable to do so or are delayed in completing it  nonrefundable fees associated with the securitization of approximately to million would be expensed immediately rather than amortized over the life of the securitization 
weighted shares outstanding for calculating diluted earnings per share are expected to decrease to approximately million shares for the first fiscal quarter of and to approximately million for fiscal year  but may vary significantly  depending upon the level of future share repurchases 
the decrease in shares outstanding will impact the resulting earnings per share calculations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has obligations for guarantees on certain franchisee loans and lease agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about these guarantees 
the company has no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  sonic enters into purchase contracts  lease agreements and borrowing arrangements 
our commitments and obligations as of august  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands total less than more than year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases total impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality we do not expect seasonality to affect our operations in a materially adverse manner 
our results during the second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of partner and franchise drive ins 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of risk  judgment and or complexity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review each partner drive in for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
we test for impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our brand and drive ins 
these impairment tests require us to estimate fair values of our brand and our drive ins by making assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
as of august   we reviewed partner drive ins with combined carrying amounts of million in property  equipment and capital leases for possible impairment  and  based on our cash flow assumptions  we determined that no impairments were needed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that no impairment was indicated 
as of august   goodwill and intangible assets totaled million 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
ownership program 
our drive in philosophy stresses an ownership relationship with supervisors and drive in managers 
most supervisors and managers of partner drive ins own an equity interest in the drive in  which is financed by third parties 
supervisors and managers are neither employees of sonic nor of the drive in in which they have an ownership interest 
the minority ownership interests in partner drive ins of the managers and supervisors are recorded as a minority interest liability on the consolidated balance sheets  and their share of the drive in earnings is reflected as minority interest in earnings of partner drive ins in the costs and expenses section of the consolidated statements of income 
the ownership agreements contain provisions  which give sonic the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority interest of the supervisor or manager in a drive in 
the amount of the investment made by a partner and the amount of the buy out are based on a number of factors  primarily upon the drive in s financial performance for the preceding months  and are intended to approximate the fair value of a minority interest in the drive in 
the company acquires and sells minority interests in partner drive ins from time to time as managers and supervisors buy out and buy in to the partnerships or limited liability companies 
if the purchase price of a minority interest that we acquire exceeds the net book value of the assets underlying the partnership interest  the excess is recorded as goodwill 
the acquisition of a minority interest for less than book value is recorded as a reduction in purchased goodwill 
any subsequent sale of the minority interest to another minority partner is recorded as a pro rata reduction of goodwill  and no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of the minority ownership interest 
goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of minority interests in partner drive ins is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment under the provisions of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties 
initial franchise fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income when we have substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise 
area development fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise drive in or upon termination of the agreement between sonic and the franchisee 
our franchisees are required under the provisions of the license agreements to pay royalties to sonic each month based on a percentage of actual net sales 
however  the royalty payments and supporting financial statements are not due until the th of the following month 
as a result  we accrue royalty revenue in the month earned based on estimates of franchise drive ins sales 
these estimates are based on actual sales at partner drive ins and projections of average unit volume growth at franchise drive ins 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as discussed further in note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective september  using the modified retrospective application method 
as a result  financial statement amounts for prior periods presented in this form k have been adjusted to reflect the fair value method of expensing prescribed by sfas r 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option pricing model along with the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based payments reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based on historical daily price changes of the company s stock for a period equal to the current expected term of the options 
the expected option term is the number of years the company estimates that options will be outstanding prior to exercise considering vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the stock based compensation expense that was recorded for the first nine months of could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
income taxes 
we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits for items such as wages paid to certain employees  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision  including legislative and judicial developments 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  typically several years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
adjustments to these estimates or returns can result in significant variability in the tax rate from period to period 
leases 
certain partner drive ins lease land and buildings from third parties 
rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the options 
judgment is required to determine options expected to be exercised 
within the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods when appropriate 
the lease term commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of leased property  which can occur before rent payments are due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent is generally based on sales levels and is accrued at the point in time we determine that it is probable that such sales levels will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sonic s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
sonic is also exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
sonic does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sonic manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of the instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at august  consisted of our senior notes  outstanding line of credit  and notes receivable 
the senior notes and line of credit were subsequently repaid with the proceeds under the term loan facility of the new senior secured credit facility 
the term loan facility bears interest at a floating rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the collective balances outstanding as of august  that were repaid by the term loan facility totaled million 
the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the average combined balance that was outstanding under the line of credit and senior notes during fiscal year would have been approximately million 
looking forward  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the balances subsequently outstanding under the new senior credit facility would be approximately million 
we have made certain loans to our franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between and 
we believe the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the company entered into an interest rate swap in february  which was designated as a cash flow hedge to modify a portion of the variable rate line of credit to a fixed rate obligation  thereby reducing the exposure to market rate fluctuations 
subsequent to repayment of the line of credit  this interest rate swap was terminated  resulting in an immaterial gain being recognized immediately to income in the first quarter of fiscal year in august  the company entered into a forward starting swap agreement  which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the securitized financing that is anticipated to be completed by december  the swap has a notional principal amount of million 
the gross fair value of the forward starting swap as of august  was a liability of million 
a increase or decrease in the benchmark rate is estimated to result in approximately a 
million increase or decrease  respectively  in the gross fair value of the forward starting swap 
commodity price risk 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  we have not made any long term commitments to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase agreements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
