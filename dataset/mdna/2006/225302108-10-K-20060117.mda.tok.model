item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and service engineering validation test equipment  diagnostics and failure analysis products and automatic test equipment  or ate  used for testing semiconductor integrated circuits  or ics 
we serve a broad spectrum of the semiconductor industry s testing needs through a wide range of products that test digital logic  mixed signal  system on a chip  radio frequency and non volatile memory semiconductors 
we utilize our proprietary technologies to design products which are intended to provide a lower total cost of ownership than many competing products currently available while meeting the increasingly demanding performance requirements of today s engineering validation test  diagnostics and failure analysis and ate markets 
our hardware products are designed to test semiconductors at two stages of their lifecycle  first  at the prototype stage  and  second  as they are produced in high volume 
collectively  our customers include major semiconductor manufacturers  fabless design houses  foundries and assembly and test services companies 
major business developments during and subsequent to the fiscal year include improvement in revenue of our soc test products  our design and characterization business  and towards the end of the year our analog and mixed signal products  delivery of the first high speed  high pin count  sapphire systems to major integrated device manufacturers

our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  excess and obsolete inventory  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  new accounting pronouncements eg  fas r  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and 
table of contents percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable factoring without recourse  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products  long lived assets valuation  warranty accrual  deferred taxes  restructuring and special charges and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
revenue recognition policies are applied consistently among our semiconductor manufacturing equipment product lines 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment only when achieving the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment  which generally occurs with mature products 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
service revenue are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customers 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
for some customers in certain countries where collection may be an issue  we may require a letter of credit to be established or cash receipt in advance before revenue can be recognized 
lease revenue is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for leases  sfas no 
 which requires that a lessor accounts for each lease by either the direct financing  sales type or operating method 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the net present value of future lease payments 
revenue from operating leases is recognized over the lease period 
during fiscal  and  we introduced several new enhancements  systems and products 
certain revenues from sales of these new enhancements  systems and products during these years were deferred until the revenue recognition requirements of our revenue recognition policy are satisfied 
this practice will continue in the future 
in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction and acceptance of new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and gross profit by us 

table of contents with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  we follow the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting principally following sab sales in the united states are principally through our direct sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and representatives 
sales outside the united states utilize both direct sales employees and distributors 
there are no significant differences in revenue recognition policies based on the sales channel  due to the business practices that have been adopted with our distributor relationships 
because of these business practices  we do not use price protection  stock rotation or similar programs with its distributors 
we do not typically sell inventory into our distributors for eventual sale to end users  but rather we sell product to the distributors on the basis of a purchase order received from an end user 
we evaluate any revenue recognition issues based on the characterization of the end customer in light of our revenue recognition policy 
our semiconductor manufacturing equipment includes embedded software 
we believe this embedded software is incidental to our products and therefore it is excluded from the scope of statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop 
also  the embedded software in our products is not sold separately  cannot be used on another vendor s products  and we cannot fundamentally enhance or expand the capability of the equipment with new or revised embedded software 
in addition  the equipment s principal performance characteristics are governed by digital speed and pin count which are primarily a function of the hardware 
deferred revenue includes deferred revenue related to maintenance contracts and other undelivered services and to extended warranties where products were sold with more than the standard one year warranty 
deferred profit is related to equipment that was shipped to certain customers  but the revenue and cost of goods sold were not recognized because the customer specified acceptance criteria has not been met as of the fiscal period end or because the customer is deemed to be a high credit risk and payment has not been received as of the fiscal period end 
we warrant our products to our customers generally for one year from the date of shipment 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we may offer customer paid extended warranty services with a fixed fee 
the fixed fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
for certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  we may grant extended payment terms 
certain of our receivables have due dates in excess of days  and we have a history of successfully collecting these extended payment term accounts receivable 
accounts receivable factoring without recourse in july  we entered into a non recourse receivables purchase agreement with a commercial bank to sell certain of our trade receivables in non recourse transactions 
these receivables were not included in our consolidated balance sheet as the criteria for sale treatment established by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sfas had been met 
under sfas  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity stops recognizing the financial assets when the control has been surrendered 
we believe our factoring agreement met the criteria of a true sale of these assets since the acquiring party retained the title to these receivables and had assumed the risk that the receivables will be collectible 
the trade receivables were sold at a discount plus administrative and other fees 
the discount amount  administrative and other fees were accounted for in other income and expenses  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the proceeds received are included as cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the facility was terminated in the quarter ended july  
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we  along with our sales and distribution partners  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record our bad debt expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  generally because of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivable balances 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers or changes in general economic conditions  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical period in our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next cyclical industry period and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
once inventories are written down  we carry that inventory at its reduced value until it is scrapped or otherwise disposed of 
we monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of the cyclical period ahead 
for the three years ended october   we have recorded a total of million in special charges for the write off of excess and obsolete inventories 
we do not as a matter of course scrap all inventory that is identified as excess or obsolete 
our products are capital goods with potentially long economic lives and  historically  the opportunity to sell these products has both arisen and fallen unexpectedly 
we have occasionally encountered unexpected demand for old products as well as the inability to transition customers to newer products 
we closely monitor the inventories that have been written down but not scrapped  so that if any sales of these items occur and affect our reported gross margins  the effect  if material  is disclosed 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if a downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or if our current product development plans change 
we consign a portion of our finished goods to both external and internal customers primarily for the purpose of customer demonstration or applications development 
this inventory is categorized as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
we depreciate all consigned inventories during the period that they are held on consignment over periods ranging from months to months 
the depreciation expense for consigned inventory is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
residual values assigned to our products that are leased to customers are based on their remaining economic life at the end of the lease terms 
the amounts assigned to the residual values are evaluated periodically based on technological change and the forecasted business cycle 
long lived asset valuation our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and identified intangible assets 
effective november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which was issued by the fasb in july under this standard  we ceased amortizing goodwill and acquired workforce effective november  
table of contents we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to our market value falling below our net book value for a significant period of time  a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a significant change in direction with respect to investment in a product or market segment  the likelihood that a significant portion of the business will be sold or disposed of  or the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit determined in accordance with sfas the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
as mandated by sfas  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july  based on the test  we determined that the sum of the expected future discounted cash flows from the assets exceeded the carrying value of those assets  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
however  no assurance can be given that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in future impairment charges 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and at such other times as events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future discounted cash flow 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of our future performance 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value  reflect our best estimates 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of purchased intangible assets  and property and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  or at least annually  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
we make certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of an acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer relations  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements  and they typically have estimated useful lives of one to ten years 

table of contents warranty accrual we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
deferred taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to calculate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset balance at the end of fiscal year was zero reflecting a full valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
we are a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory rates and enacted tax rules  including transfer pricing 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have an impact on our effective tax rate 
restructuring and special charges over the past years  we have recorded restructuring charges as we rationalized operations in light of customer demand declines and the economic downturn 
these measures  which included major changes in senior management  workforce reduction  facilities consolidation and changes to the strategic focus of a number of sites  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipate customer demand and to transition our operations to lower cost regions 
the restructuring charges include employee severance and benefit costs  write offs of property and equipment and costs related to leased facilities vacated and subleased 
severance and benefit costs and other costs associated with restructuring activities were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas 
we also record severance and benefit costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits  sfas  as we conclude that a we have a substantive post employment benefit obligation that is attributed to prior services rendered  b rights to those benefits have vested  and c payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed restructuring plan 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of original estimates 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives and other special charges 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring and other plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 

table of contents stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas r 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 

sab no 
provides the sec s staff s position regarding the application of sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  and also provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we will adopt sfas r  utilizing the modified prospective method  in the first quarter of fiscal and will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our operating results and financial condition 
our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impacts 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated fiscal years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold on net sales cost of goods sold special charges gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development restructuring and special charges total operating expenses operating loss net loss vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts  lease and rental income 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal for the fiscal year ended october   net sales from our soc  design characterization product line and service increased to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the may acquisition of nptest  but also represented the increasing acceptance of the sapphire and diagnostics and characterization tools as well as an increase in our installed base of systems 
net sales from our analog mixed signal and memory products declined to million during the fiscal year ended october  from million during the same period of fiscal the decline results from the cyclically low demand in these markets  particularly for the memory products which are directed at the nor memory group 
the decline was softened somewhat by improving volumes for the analog mixed signal products in the second half of fiscal sustainability of the revenue levels is dependent upon the economic and geopolitical climate as well as other risks described under the title risk factors herein 
we anticipate net sales will decrease by approximately to for the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
capital markets in asia historically have been highly volatile and in some asian regions there have been geopolitical unrest  both of which have resulted in economic instabilities 
these potential economic instabilities could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of soc analog mixed signal memory diagnostics and characterization group service and other total gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  sell through of previously written down inventory  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  special charges  and field service margins 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained at for fiscal and excluding the effect of special charges  the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the special charges in were for the write down of kalos ii inventory due to our decision to invest in the next generation memory product as well as to lack of demand  obsolete revisions of sapphire inventory resulting from our decision to market sapphire as our sole solution for the high end soc market and excess and obsolete octet and vanguard ii inventory and assets due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in these redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
special charges in related primarily to obsolete octet and quartet inventory and assets  again due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in these redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
gross margin excluding special charges declined from to principally because we replaced higher margin analog mixed signal and memory revenues with somewhat lower margin sapphire revenues 
the decline was less than it otherwise might have been because of the efficiencies gained when we consolidated our three principal manufacturing facilities into one in the second and third quarter of in addition  during the fiscal year ended october  and  our gross margin benefited by approximately and  respectively  from the sale of fully reserved inventory 
excluding the effect of the special charges  we believe gross margins could be flat to slightly higher in the next several quarters 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in spending in fiscal resulted primarily from the significant resources invested in the development of new products and product enhancements of approximately million offset by a million decrease in bonuses earned and a million decline in licenses fees 
r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to higher r d expenses as well as lower net sales during as compared to fiscal we anticipate that r d expenses for fiscal will be flat in absolute dollars when compared to those recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to activities resulting from the acquisition of nptest in may  including an increase in integration expense of million  an increase in product consignment expense of million due to the number of sapphire systems consigned and an increase in compensation costs of million 
in addition  we incurred approximately 
table of contents million of costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance program  expenses related to salaries  consulting and audit fees 
these increases were offset by a decrease in marketing spending of million  a decrease in distributors and sales person commissions of million  a decrease in other variable compensation of million and decrease in fringe benefits costs of million 
these decreases were caused by the decrease in net sales as well as a focused effort to decrease spending 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to a full year of nptest and associated integration spending in versus five months in as well as lower sales levels during as compared to fiscal we expect sg a expenses in fiscal to be flat to down in absolute dollars when compared to those recorded in fiscal amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was higher in fiscal due primarily to the acquisition of nptest in may remaining estimated annual amortization expense for purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation is expected to be million  million  and million  in the fiscal years ending in through  respectively 
restructuring charges 
in fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million 
of the million  million was for severance and other related charges which accounted for a headcount reduction of employees 
of the million  the amount recorded under fas at october  was million 
the affected employees were primarily in research and development and selling general and administrative functions throughout the world 
write off of property and equipment amounted to million  resulted from our decision to halt additional research and development investment in one of our products that was rendered redundant by the acquisition of nptest 
operating lease and leasehold restoration charges of million  which are net of expected sublease rentals  resulted from vacating the former nptest headquarters facilities in san jose 
outsource it contract cancellation charges amounted to million 
these charges were offset by deferred rent write off of million and prior accrual adjustment of million  primarily related to severance and related charges 
see note special charges and restructuring  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline from fiscal was primarily due to lower average investment balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal offset by a higher average interest rate 
interest expense 
interest expenses were million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the interest expense in fiscal and was primarily attributable to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june other income and expenses  net 
other income  net was million and million in fiscal year and  respectively  a decline of million 
the decrease in other income  net  from to was primarily due to the fair value adjustment of an acquired liability owed to the former parent of nptest  schlumberger limited schlumberger 
this liability was settled during the third quarter of fiscal for a total settlement value of million 
as of october   this liability was million 
see note acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense for the period consisted of net us current income tax expense of million and foreign tax expense on earnings and foreign withholding taxes of million generated from our foreign operations 
at october   we had unused net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in 
table of contents through utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain reversals of temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to uncertainties in the timing and amount of such realization of our deferred tax assets  we have provided a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred assets at october  and october  we expect to record a full valuation allowance on domestic tax benefits until we can sustain a consistent level of profitability 
until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our results of operations 
vs 
net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these improvements in net sales were due primarily to a general upturn in the industry during the first three quarters of and to our purchase of nptest in the third quarter of fiscal for the fiscal years ended october  and  net sales from our digital and mixed signal products was million and million  respectively 
net sales from our memory products increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal in addition  our service revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the acquisition of nptest brought an additional million of digital and mixed signal revenues  million of diagnostic system revenues  and million of service revenues 
sustainability of these revenue levels is dependent upon the economic and geopolitical climate  as well as other risks described under the heading risk factors herein 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  international net sales for nptest represented of nptest s product and services net sales 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of soc analog mixed signal memory design characterization group service and other total operating lease and rental revenues were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal gross margins from fiscal levels primarily reflected the benefits of a higher operating efficiencies and other factors described below  offset by the effect of special charges in fiscal cost of sales of million related to excess and obsolete inventory and other charges due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in our redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
in fiscal the special charges to cost of goods sold consisted of million for a legal settlement with an inventory supplier and million in spare part write offs in our valstar product line 
excluding the effect of these special charges  the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to better manufacturing 
table of contents efficiencies stemming from higher production volumes as well as better product mix of newer products with higher gross margins 
in addition  during fiscal year  our gross margin benefited by approximately from the sale of fully reserved inventory and the sale of kalos asic devices previously written down in a lower of cost or market provision 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million in the fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in spending during fiscal resulted primarily from the acquisition of nptest  in which contributed an additional million of r d expenses 
excluding nptest  r d expense decreased for the fiscal year primarily due to the reduction in our headcount of people in the third quarter of fiscal  of which were in r d 
in addition  there were several products  including asl and kalos  that had been released to manufacturing  resulting in lower non recurring engineering nre expenses associated with the development of those products 
these savings were partially offset by the ongoing investment in new products and r d expenses associated with the products obtained in the acquisition of nptest 
r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the higher sales levels during as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of nptest  which resulted in an additional million of sg a expenses 
for the year ended october   there was an increase in variable compensation and commissions of million related to our overall increase in net sales and profitability 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of expenses for costs associated with the integration of nptest which primarily included acquisition consulting fees related to workforce and product line decisions 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we accelerated the remaining depreciation for leasehold improvements and property and equipment of million related to buildings located in fremont that we vacated when we moved to our new headquarters in milpitas 
these accelerated depreciation charges ended in the first quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the higher sales levels during as compared to fiscal amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was higher in fiscal due primarily to the acquisition of nptest in may in process research and development 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of nptest 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million in for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the purchase of optonics 
the charges were recorded as an operating expense

the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances in fiscal interest expense 
interest expenses were million and million for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increased of million 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june other income and expenses  net 
other income and expenses were million of income and million of expenses for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase in other income and expenses  net  in fiscal primarily was due to the mark down to fair value of an acquired liability owed to the former parent of nptest 
the decline in the liability during the year was million as the liability declined from million at the may  acquisition date to million at october  the current value of the liability was based on our stock price as of october  income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense in consisted of us current income tax benefits of million and foreign tax on earnings and foreign withholding taxes of million generated from our foreign operations  primarily germany 
the current us income tax benefit consisted of million attributable to the settlement of an irs audit  million related to domestic tax contingency reserves and net operating loss carryback for nptest of million 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal for fiscal and  the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
at october   we had unused net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in through liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million 
the net cash flows used by operating activities for fiscal were primarily the net loss before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million offset by cash generated from working capital of million 
cash generated by working capital included million from a reduction in accounts receivable and million from a reduction in inventories 
the accounts receivable reduction resulted primarily from improved collections as days sales in accounts receivable dropped from days at the end of to days at the end of the inventory reduction was attributable primarily to increase in sales of analog mixed signal and sapphire products in the latter part of investing activities provided net cash of approximately million in fiscal resulted primarily from net sales and maturities of available for sale securities of million and from sales of property and equipment of million  offset by million used to acquire property and equipment 
financing activities provided net cash flows of million in fiscal the cash in fiscal was primarily provided by million received from the issuance of common stock relating to our employee equity plans which were offset in part by payments of bank loans and notes payable related to leased products of million 

table of contents as of october   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  and accounts receivable and inventories totaling million 
we believe that  because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our products and the new products we presently plan to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of our working capital 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the ate industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is possible that events related to these factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
see discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
as a result of the nptest acquisition  we were required to make a payment to schlumberger limited at a date in the future pursuant to a provision in the acquisition agreement between nptest and schlumberger under which nptest was acquired by francisco partners  lp from schlumberger limited 
the payment amount was contingent upon the value of our common stock at the time of distribution 
in may  the parties reached a settlement  which required us to pay schlumberger approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock which was valued at million for a total settlement value of million 
according to this settlement  we fulfilled our obligations to schlumberger and there were no outstanding liabilities in relation to this transaction at the end of fiscal we lease some of our facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire through of which million represents lease commitments that have been written off to special operating charges during fiscal and fiscal of the million in lease commitments  the san jose  california lease accounted for million 
the future minimum lease payments at october  are as follows in thousands committed gross lease payments leases written off in restructuring charges net estimated future lease expense thereafter the leases written off in special charges of million are accounted for in our accrued expenses and other liabilities balance on the consolidated balance sheets at october

this is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as bank loans and notes payable leased products 
this is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as convertible subordinated notes 
this amount is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred profit 
some of the components that we purchase are unique to us and must be purchased in relatively high minimum quantities with long four and five month lead times 
these business circumstances can lead to us holding relatively high inventory levels and associated risks 
in addition  purchase commitments for unique components are relatively inflexible in terms of deferral or cancellation 
at october   we had open and committed non cancelable purchase orders totaling approximately million 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at october  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these arrangements provide for potential cancellation charges 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe our current cash and investment positions will be sufficient to meet our anticipated business requirements for the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of october   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  no material commitments for capital expenditures and did not have any special purpose entities

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation

under this pronouncement changes are required to be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
retrospective application means the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  us treasury notes and obligations of us government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except percent amounts 
future maturities of investments held at october  balance october  balance october  thereafter cash equivalents amounts average rate short term investments amounts average rate total investment average rate equity instruments we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
the sensitivity analysis model used by us for interest rate exposure compares interest income on current investment interest rates versus current investment levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase or decrease would result in an increase or a decrease in interest income of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond our control 
foreign exchange we generate a significant portion of our sales from customers located outside the united states  principally in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
international sales are made mostly to foreign distributors and some foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in us dollars  but occasionally are denominated in the local currency for european and japanese customers 
the subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our automotive product line is developed and manufactured in germany and thus those expenses are euro based 
accordingly  some of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
for the fiscal year ended october  and  we recorded foreign currency gains of million and foreign currency losses of million  respectively 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and 
table of contents restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we do not currently use derivatives  but will continue to assess the need for these instruments in the future 
interest rate risk the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of  and therefore changes in interest rates do not impact our interest expense on this debt 
we from time to time have outstanding short term borrowings with variable interest rates 
the total average amount of these borrowings outstanding annually has been insignificant 
therefore  we expect that a change in interest rate will not have any material effect on our interest expense
