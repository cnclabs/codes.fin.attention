item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company designs  markets  and underwrites specialty commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products for select markets or niches by offering differentiated products through multiple distribution channels 
the company s operations are classified into three reportable business segments which are organized around its three underwriting divisions the commercial lines underwriting group  which has underwriting responsibility for the commercial multi peril package  commercial automobile and specialty property and inland marine insurance products  the specialty lines underwriting group  which has underwriting responsibility for the professional and management liability insurance products  and the personal lines group  which has responsibility for personal property and casualty insurance products for the homeowners and manufactured housing markets 
the company operates solely within the united states through its regional and field offices 
the company generates most of its revenues through the sale of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance policies 
the commercial insurance policies are sold through the company s five distribution channels which include direct sales  retail insurance agents open brokerage  wholesalers  preferred agents and the internet 
the company believes that consistency in its field office representation has created excellent relationships with local insurance agencies across the country 
the personal insurance policies are almost exclusively sold over the internet via the company s proprietary in touch system 
during  revenue growth from the sale of commercial and personal property and casualty policies was impacted by the following items increased premium rate competition for specialty lines segment products and for the specialty property product  several products within the commercial and specialty lines segments were identified that did not meet predetermined standards for profitability and were culled resulting in approximately a million reduction in gross written premiums  the product mix shift in personal lines was substantially completed resulting in a million reduction in mobile homeowners gross written premium and a million increase in the newer construction homeowners gross written premiums  the decisions by an automobile leasing customer and an automobile excess liability customer to self insure business previously written by the company 
as a result  gross written premiums for the commercial lines segment were reduced by approximately million 
introduction of a number of new products  many of which were within the existing sports and fitness market niche in the commercial lines segment 
notwithstanding the adverse impact of certain of the above items  gross written premium growth remained strong across the company s commercial and specialty lines business segment 
the company believes its mixed marketing platform for its product distribution and the creation of value added features not typically found in property and casualty products contribute to generating premium growth above industry averages

hurricanes dennis  katrina  rita and wilma caused catastrophic losses during  and the company also suffered catastrophe losses from a number of hurricanes during these catastrophe losses  as noted in the table below  impacted both the company s 
table of contents personal and commercial lines segments 
loss estimates may still change in the future due in part to the number of claims which have not yet been completely remediated or for which the property covered by the claim has not been repaired 
under the company s catastrophe reinsurance programs in place for these hurricanes  the company had a million pre tax per occurrence loss retention for its personal lines catastrophe losses and a million pre tax per occurrence loss retention for its commercial lines catastrophe losses 
under the loss occurrence provisions of the company s commercial lines catastrophe reinsurance program  hurricane katrina was treated as two separate loss occurrences 
as a result  the company estimates it has retained a million loss 
the company s net loss retention by hurricane is summarized in the table below date of event hurricane dennis katrina rita wilma total in millions net loss and loss adjustment expense estimates personal lines segment commercial lines segment total the calendar year also included million of favorable development on prior accident years net loss and loss adjustment expense 
the favorable net loss and loss adjustment expense development occurred primarily in the commercial and specialty lines segment in accident years and this favorable development is primarily attributed to better than expected claim frequency for commercial package business and better than expected case incurred development for professional liability business for accident year for accident year  the favorable development resulted from decreased loss estimates across most commercial and specialty lines of business due to better than expected case incurred loss development 
the following table illustrates the calendar year and accident year loss ratios by segment 
commercial specialty personal weighted lines lines lines average calendar year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio accident year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio the company recorded a million impairment charge related to the write down of the entire amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition of its personal lines segment based upon its annual impairment test 
the write down was a result of changes to the personal lines segment business plan due to various factors  including  among others the forecasted weather pattern of increased hurricane activity and the disruption in the florida marketplace due to the and hurricane activity 
the company believes its core strategy of adhering to an underwriting philosophy of sound risk selection and pricing discipline enables the company to produce loss ratios well below industry averages 
the company monitors certain measures of growth and profitability of each business unit including but not limited to number of policies written  renewal retention ratios  new business production  pricing  risk selection and loss ratios 
other key financial metrics that are regularly monitored in evaluating financial condition and operating performance include  but are not limited to level of expenses  investment performance  return on equity  cash flow and capital leverage

table of contents certain critical accounting estimates and judgments investments fair values the carrying amount for the company s investments approximates their estimated fair value 
the company measures the fair value of investments based upon quoted market prices or by obtaining quotes from third party broker dealers 
material assumptions and factors utilized by such broker dealers in pricing these securities include future cash flows  constant default rates  recovery rates and any market clearing activity that may have occurred since the prior month end pricing period 
the company s total investments include million in securities for which there is no readily available independent market price 
other than temporary impairment  excluding interests in securitized assets the company regularly performs various analytical procedures with respect to its investments  including identifying any security whose fair value is below its cost 
upon identification of such securities  a detailed review is performed for all securities meeting predetermined thresholds to determine whether such decline is other than temporary 
if the company determines a decline in value to be other than temporary  based upon its detailed review  or if a decline in value for an equity investment has persisted continuously for nine months  the cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value 
the factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a decline below cost is other than temporary include  but are not limited to whether the issuer is in financial distress  the performance of the collateral underlying a secured investment  whether a significant credit rating action has occurred  whether scheduled interest payments have been delayed or missed  whether changes in laws and or regulations have impacted an issuer or industry  an assessment of the timing of a security s recovery to fair value  and an ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
the amount of any write down is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose see investments 
gross unrealized losses for investments excluding interests in securitized assets at december  were million 
impairment recognition for investments in securitized assets the company conducts its impairment evaluation and recognition for interests in securitized assets in accordance with the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board 
pursuant to this guidance  impairment losses on securities must be recognized if both the fair value of the security is less than its book value and the net present value of expected future cash flows is less than the net present value of expected future cash flows at the most recent estimation date 
if these criteria are met  an impairment charge  calculated as the difference between the current book value of the security and its fair value  is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose see investments 
gross unrealized losses for investments in securitized assets at december  were million 
there are certain risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s impairment methodology including  but not limited to  the financial condition of specific industry sectors and the resultant effect on any underlying collateral values and changes in accounting  tax and or regulatory requirements which may have an effect on either  or both  the investor and or the issuer 
liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the company s best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related settlement expenses with respect to insured events 
the process of establishing the liability for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is a complex and imprecise process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
this liability includes an amount determined on the basis of claim adjusters evaluations with respect to insured events that have been reported to the company and an amount for losses incurred that have not been reported to the company 
in some cases significant periods of time  up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss and the reporting of such to the company 
estimates for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on management s assessment of known facts and circumstances  review of past loss experience and settlement patterns  and consideration of other factors such as legal  social  and economic developments 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and any adjustments resulting therefrom are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 

table of contents the table below classifies as of december  the components of the reserve for gross losses and loss expenses loss or losses with respect to major lines of business in thousands as of december  case ibnr total gross loss reserves by line of business commercial lines segment commercial package general liability commercial package auto commercial package property automobile rental supplemental liability automobile rental other program umbrella other specialty lines segment professional liability errors omissions professional liability directors officers professional liability excess personal lines segment personal lines total the most significant actuarial assumptions used in determining the company s loss reserves are ultimate losses are determinable by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past via loss development factor selection that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
this assumption implies that historical claim reporting  handling  and settlement patterns are predictive of future activity and can thus be utilized to forecast ultimate liabilities on unpaid claims 
since the many factors that influence claim activity can change over time and are often difficult to isolate or quantify  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
key objectives in developing estimates of ultimate losses are to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and to adjust for them so that the future can be projected on a more reliable basis 
various diagnostic tools are employed  eg  ratios of claims paid to claims reported and analyses of average claim costs by age of development  and close communication is maintained among the company s actuarial  claims and underwriting departments to continually monitor and assess the validity of this assumption 
in general  this assumption is considered fully valid across the company s lines of business for older  more mature accident years 
most claims in these years have been reported  fully adjusted and settled  and any remaining unpaid claims are not anticipated to result in incurred loss activity at levels significant enough to cause material deviation in ultimate losses as projected by generally accepted actuarial methods that rely upon this assumption 
loss reserve indications from generally accepted actuarial methods that rely upon this assumption are utilized where this assumption is considered fully valid 
where this assumption is considered to have less than full validity  those indications receive partial or no weight 
ultimate loss ratios ultimate losses divided by earned premiums in the current and most recent accident years can be projected from ultimate loss ratios of prior years after adjusting for factors such as trends and pricing changes  to the extent that those factors can be quantified 

table of contents this assumption implies consistency in the loss ratio  after adjusting for inflationary factors and other trends that may be affecting losses and or premiums 
generally accepted actuarial methods employing this expected loss ratio assumption are used to supplement loss reserve indications from standard loss development methods where the validity of the first assumption discussed is incomplete 
while this assumption is also subject to validity constraints  it is generally considered to have higher reliability than the first assumption discussed for the current and more recently completed accident years  as changes in rates and pricing can be monitored and loss trends can be derived or inferred from both internal and external sources 
the company s methodology is to employ several generally accepted actuarial methods to determine loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
these methods generally fall into one of the categories described below  or they are hybrids of one or more of them eg  bornhuetter ferguson method which blends development and expected methods 
the predictive accuracy of any of these methods may vary by line of business  age of development  and credibility of underlying historical experience data 
loss development methods tend to be more accurate where claims data are relatively stable and for older accident years within most lines of business 
expected loss methods and hybrid methods can be more appropriate for more recent accident years 
adjusted historical loss development methods are employed where volatile claims data can be largely attributed to discernable events  such as changes in claim handling procedures 
accordingly  more or less weight is placed on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the actuarially determined loss reserve estimates are made 
historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as claim settlement patterns  inflation  or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses  because cumulative loss payments can take much longer to converge on the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established or material changes in the underlying loss exposures and or circumstances which may lead to a claim being reported  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  such as rate changes and trends affecting the frequency and or severity of claims  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums earned during a given accident period to calculate ultimate losses incurred during that same period 
expected loss ratio methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available  and in new or growing lines of business where historical information may lack predictive accuracy or otherwise not be representative of current loss exposures 
where expected loss ratio methods are employed  one or more of several traditional and accepted actuarial estimation methods are used to select expected loss ratios  including loss ratios from mature years adjusted for trends in pricing and claim costs  permissible loss ratios underlying current rate levels  and projections of industry loss ratios in similar lines 

table of contents adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of recent changes  such as inflation  changes in coverage and or demographics of the line of business  the speed of claim payments  or the adequacy of case reserves 
during periods of significant change  adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses provided the actuaries can reasonably quantify the impact of each change 
frequency severity methods these methods combine estimates of ultimate claim counts and estimates of per claim ultimate loss severities to yield estimates of ultimate losses 
ultimate claim counts frequency are typically estimated using expected ratios of claims to a selected base eg  exposures or policy counts  with the expected ratios being based on historically observed experience 
adjustments for trends affecting claim occurrence or affecting the value of the base are also typically made 
ultimate loss severity estimates are typically based on historically observed per claim average losses and are adjusted for trends affecting the size of claims  most notably inflation 
the company uses this method only in the case of its residual value product 
each of the generally accepted actuarial methods employed generates discrete point estimates of ultimate loss by line of business  by accident year 
while the estimates are often similar across methods  a diverse array of estimates may be generated  particularly for current and recently completed accident years of longer tailed lines and lines of business experiencing growth 
often the outlying point estimates among these diverse results can be dismissed as unreasonable because either the key assumptions of the method generating those outliers are violated or the underlying data feeding that method are too thin for meaningful results 
the remaining indications generally form a reasonable range of point estimates from which informed judgment is utilized to select the actuarially determined estimate 
for most lines of business  given the high level of case reserve adequacy observed in recent calendar periods and the consistent claim reserving practices employed by the company s claim staff  loss reserves for older accident years are generally set in accordance with ultimate projections from incurred loss development methods 
projections from paid loss development methods may be selected for these older accident years where very few claims remain open and case reserves held for those claims are low relative to observed historical average severities of similar claims 
for two specialty lines professional liability products corporate directors and officers and lawyers errors and omissions  changes in claims handling occurred within the past several years that may invalidate the assumptions underlying the standard incurred loss development method 
for these products  indications from adjusted historical incurred loss development methods were utilized in place of the standard method in forming the actuarially determined estimate  as the adjustments made attempt to re state historical experience as it might have appeared had current claim handling practices been in place throughout 
data for the current accident year are often too limited to provide fully reliable indications using standard loss development methods due to the delays in reporting claims and the limited time that has elapsed for adjusting the known claims 
for longer tail coverages and lines experiencing exposure growth  data may be somewhat limited in the more recently completed accident years  as well  for similar reasons 
in such situations  ultimate loss is assessed by weighting results from standard paid and incurred loss development methods  with results from expected loss ratio and hybrid methods 
the judgmental weights assigned are based upon the partial validity that can be attributed to the traditional methods  given the stability of underlying claim activity and exposures  with the complement of that partial validity given to the indications from expected loss ratio methods 
the actuarially determined estimates by line of business are often based upon a weighted average of these results 
the company has a loss reserve review committee consisting of the most senior members of actuarial  corporate  claims  underwriting and financial management 
this committee meets monthly to review and discuss the various monthly and quarterly actuarial analyses which are performed  as well as to discuss any other factors or trends that may influence the company s claims activity 
generally  loss reserves are recorded in accordance with the actuarially determined estimates by line 
however  based upon review performed by the loss reserve committee  the committee may make a management adjustment to an actuarially determined estimate for a line of business if  in the committee s collective judgment  factors affecting ultimate losses in a line have not been fully captured or considered by actuarial methods 
this may be the case with newer product lines  lines that are growing  and or lines which may be exposed to claims with latent emergence patterns that extend beyond the credible historical period that the company has experienced to date 
any such management adjustment is documented and reported to the company s audit committee 
the company s loss reserve committee did not establish a 
table of contents management adjustment as of december  accordingly  the loss reserves recorded in the financial statements as of december  are equal to the actuarially determined estimate for each line of business 
due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  trends affecting loss development factors and pricing adequacy  the company s key actuarial assumptions may change 
approximately of the company s loss reserves are for accident years through these accident years are also the period where changes  if any  to the factors underlying the actuarial assumptions would be most likely to occur 
the quantification referred to in the next paragraph of the impact that changes to the actuarial assumptions could have are stated without any adjustment for reinsurance and before the effects of taxes 
changes may occur in the actuarial assumption that ultimate losses are determinable by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past via loss development factor selection that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
changes may also occur in the actuarial assumption that ultimate loss ratios in the current and most recent accident years can be projected from ultimate loss ratios of prior years 
a increase or decrease to the actuarially selected loss development factors and expected loss ratios  in the aggregate  as applicable to all lines of business in accident years to  would increase or decrease the actuarially determined loss reserve estimate by approximately million 
the results of aggregate changes in the loss development factors and expected loss ratios are approximately linear over reasonable ranges 
a increase or decrease in the loss development factors and expected loss ratios  in the aggregate  would have impacts equal to approximately of the impacts stated above 
reinsurance receivables reinsurance receivables from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are subject to estimation 
reinsurance receivables may prove uncollectible if reinsurers are unable or unwilling to perform under the company s reinsurance contracts due to  but not limited to  such factors as the reinsurers financial condition or coverage disputes 
reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s regular review of amounts outstanding  length of collection period  changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors 
reinsurance receivables at december  amounted to million  and the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance receivables amounted to million 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to an annual impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
this annual test is performed at december of each year or more frequently if events or circumstance change that require the company to perform the impairment analysis on an interim basis 
goodwill impairment testing requires the evaluation of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill  and recording of an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based on management s best estimate  which includes valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows  market multiples and comparable transactions
