item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see forward looking statements and risk factors  below 
our business our business is organized into three segments timber  paper and paperboard and converted products 
we benefit from significant integration between our business segments 
during fiscal year  our paper and paperboard segment obtained approximately of its wood chips from logs that were harvested from our timberlands and chipped by our chipping operations 
in the same period  our converted products segment effectively obtained approximately of its paperboard requirements from our longview mill either by direct shipment from our longview mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements with third parties  representing approximately of total mill production 
in addition  our business segments share centralized corporate management  accounting  human resources and information systems support 
net sales for individual segments are reported net of intercompany transfers 
segment operating profits reflect allocations of selling  administrative and general expenses on the basis of the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
in the case of intercompany transfers  cost of products sold is based upon transfer pricing policies that we believe assist us in managing and optimizing the consolidated financial performance of our business as a whole 
for example  paperboard supplied from our longview mill and used in our converting operations is assigned a transfer price equal to our longview mill s cost 
paperboard purchased through buy sell agreements is assigned a price equal to the cost from the third party 
see fiscal year compared to fiscal year selected segment results below for a more detailed discussion of these arrangements  including a review of the accounting for the buy sell agreements 
depending on market conditions  our transfer pricing practices may understate or overstate the actual price at which we could have sold those products into the open market or the actual price in the open market at which we could have purchased the raw materials used to produce those products 
as a consequence  these allocations and transfer pricing policies sometimes result in individual segment results that do not reflect the financial performance that would have resulted for a segment operating as a stand alone business 
our timber segment owns and operates timberlands in oregon and washington and produces logs for sale in the domestic and export markets 
during fiscal year  our log customers consisted of independent sawmills and plywood plants in the united states and four export customers 
results of operations for our timber segment also include the sale of lumber from our sawmill 
net sales of our timber segment are primarily affected by housing starts and other construction activity in the domestic and japanese markets 
construction activity is influenced by mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions in those markets 
net sales in this segment are also affected by supply side factors such as government regulation restricting the harvest of timber from public and certain private lands and competition from logs supplied by foreign producers  especially canadian producers 
the strength of the japanese export market can significantly influence the results of our timber segment since our sales into that market tend to be at higher prices than sales into the domestic market 
because all of our sales are us dollar denominated  our export sales are also significantly influenced by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
cost of products sold in the timber segment primarily include contract logging expense  the cost of operating our sawmill  and depletion  which is based on the historical cost of timber that is harvested 
our paper and paperboard segment produces a wide variety of paper and paperboard products at our longview mill 
we sell these products to a number of domestic and export customers 
in fiscal year  our converted products segment obtained approximately of our longview mill s paper and paperboard output either by direct shipment from our longview mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
net sales in the paper and paperboard segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states and southeast asia and the relative strength of the us dollar 
average prices in this segment have been favorably affected by industry capacity rationalization over the last several years 
the demand for certain specialty products manufactured by our paper and paperboard segment tends to be less dependent on the economic cycles affecting the commodity paper market 
the major component of cost of products sold for the paper and paperboard segment is fiber  which consists primarily of wood chips  but also includes sawdust and recycled materials 
we have invested in processes that allow us to use an increased proportion of sawdust  hardwood chips and recycled materials to reduce our pulp costs in making our paper and paperboard products 
cost of products sold also includes labor  energy and chemicals used in processing 
our converted products segment produces corrugated containers  solid fiber boxes and creative point of purchase displays 
nearly all of our converted products are sold domestically for end uses that include packaging for consumables such as fresh and frozen produce and beverages  as well as for toys  furniture and electronics 
net sales in the converted products segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states  however  sales of some of our products used in the food and beverage industry are less sensitive to general economic activity 
the primary constituent material for our converted products is paperboard 
our converted products segment effectively obtained approximately of its paperboard requirements from our longview mill either by direct shipment from our longview mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements with third parties 
cost of products sold also includes energy  labor  ink and glue 
our longview mill contains six steam driven generators and one natural gas fired co generation facility  all of which are capable of producing electrical power 
in the past  we elected  based on the relationship between rates we could obtain for third party sales of electricity and the cost to us of purchasing electricity and natural gas  to sell a significant percentage of the electricity that we generated into the market and to allocate the operating profit from those sales to the paper and paperboard and converted products segments based on the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
the primary contracts pursuant to which we purchased and sold power expired in fiscal year and  under current terms  we have significantly less flexibility in selling and using power generated by our facilities 
we did not sell any power during the prior three years 
our future decisions concerning electrical power generation  including the extent to which we operate our co generation facility  will change from period to period based on market conditions 
we do not expect sales of power to contribute meaningfully to our results in the coming year 
we experience some seasonality in our business and operating results  with the first quarter ending january of our historical fiscal year typically reflecting reduced activity in all of our segments 
in our timber segment  timber harvest activity is affected by winter weather in the pacific northwest 
in our converted products and paper and paperboard segments  reduced domestic agricultural activity during the winter months  particularly in the pacific northwest  and the effect of pre holiday season demand for paper and packaging material can negatively affect demand 
while these seasonal influences do generally affect our financial results  in some years other factors affecting supply and demand for our products  especially with respect to our manufacturing segments  may have a more significant impact on quarter to quarter comparisons 
we can curtail the operation of certain of our equipment and facilities from time to time to provide us with flexibility in managing our operations and cost structure 
in order to meet market conditions and to maximize the efficient use of our paper machines  we fully curtailed two of our twelve paper machines for all of fiscal year and fiscal year the two fully curtailed paper machines  and  are no longer available for operation and  accordingly  assets with book value of million and related spare parts of million were written off as a non cash charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year see fiscal year compared to fiscal year selected segment results below 
dependent primarily on product demand  we operated the paper machine for parts of fiscal years and but not continuously for either year 
given market conditions  we may curtail the operation of certain of our converting facilities if we believe it is advantageous to do so 
the reit conversion on july   our board of directors  after reviewing various strategic alternatives  authorized us to take the steps necessary to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes  effective january  a reit is a company that derives most of its income from investments in real estate  which may include timberlands 
if a corporation qualifies as a reit  it generally will not be subject to corporate income taxes on income and gains from investments in real estate  to the extent that it distributes such income and gains to its shareholders 
our principal reit qualifying investment consists of our timberlands 
as a reit  we would continue to be required to pay federal corporate income tax on earnings from our non real estate investments  principally our manufacturing operations  and on income from our real estate investments that is not distributed to our shareholders 
our election to be taxed as a reit effective january  remains subject to final approval by our board of directors and would be made in connection with the filing of our federal income tax return for effective december   in order to comply with reit qualification requirements  we transferred to longview trs those assets and businesses that cannot be held or operated directly by longview fibre company consistent with reit tax rules 
the transferred assets consist principally of our various manufacturing and processing facilities  including our longview mill  our converting plants and our sawmill  and the related businesses and operations including cash and working capital 
longview fibre company  and not longview trs  will continue to own and manage our approximately  acres of timberlands 
longview fibre company and longview trs will jointly elect for longview trs to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  effective upon the effective date of our election to be taxed as a reit 
the trs will be subject to corporate level tax on its earnings 
in order to be eligible to elect reit status  we will be required to provide shareholders with a special distribution of our earnings and profits  or e p  attributable to taxable periods ending prior to the effective date of our election to be treated as a reit  which is expected to be january  this special distribution is referred to as the e p distribution 
to qualify as a reit in  we would have to complete the e p distribution on or before december  we anticipate that the e p distribution will be taxable as a dividend to our shareholders and will be valued between approximately million and million 
shareholders generally will have the opportunity to elect to receive the e p distribution in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
shareholders owning less than a number of shares to be specified in documents we provide at the time of the election will receive only cash for their portion of the e p distribution 
the aggregate amount of cash to be received by all shareholders in the e p distribution will be limited to approximately of the e p distribution 
our financial results following the reit conversion will differ from our historical results 
the most significant changes that will affect our future results include a reduction in provision for income taxes  an increase in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock relative to prior periods as a result of the common stock portion of the e p distribution  which increase will not be reflected in such prior periods and will therefore affect period to period comparisons of per share financial information  and an increase in the dividends we pay on our common stock  pursuant to our new dividend policy described under liquidity and capital resources  below 
we do not expect that the effectiveness of the reit conversion will affect the composition of our reportable segments 
we expect that longview fibre company  as a reit  will generate substantially all of its income from the sale of standing timber to longview trs at market prices pursuant to a timber cutting contract 
this income  and any other income we derive from owning and managing our timberlands  generally will not be subject to corporate level tax  except to the extent we retain those earnings 
to the extent that we retain net capital gains as a reit  we would be required to pay income tax on such gains at regular corporate tax rates 
if we retain and pay taxes on net capital gains  our shareholders  though required to include their proportionate share of the undistributed long term capital gain in income  would receive a credit or refund for their share of the federal income tax paid by us 
our ability to receive dividends from longview trs from which we would make distributions to our shareholders is limited by the rules we must comply with to maintain our status as a reit 
in particular  at least of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income 
no more than of our gross income may consist of dividends from longview trs and other non qualifying types of income 
as a result  if our non reit activities conducted through longview trs were to become highly profitable  we might be limited in our ability to receive distributions from longview trs in an amount required to fund dividends to our shareholders commensurate with that profitability 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  no more than of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of subsidiaries that are trss 
this limitation may affect our ability to make investments in non reit qualifying operations  including our manufacturing operations  which are held by longview trs 
change in fiscal year effective january   we changed our fiscal year end from october to december  as required by reit regulations 
results of operations the following table highlights our net sales and profits for the periods indicated audited fiscal years ended october thousands net sales timber paper and paperboard converted products cost of products sold selling  administrative and general expense loss on asset abandonment operating profit loss timber paper and paperboard converted products interest expense provision for taxes on income net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year  an increase of 
this overall increase reflected increases in net sales of million  or  in our paper and paperboard segment and million  or  in our converted products segment  which more than offset a decrease in net sales of million  or  in our timber segment 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of increased higher margin log sales  led by log price increases  partially offset by lumber price decreases  an increase in logging and hauling costs of  and higher depletion cost 
cost of products sold was favorably impacted by a reduction in total purchased energy cost per ton of production at our longview mill of  labor productivity gains as indicated by reductions in total labor hours per ton of production of at our longview mill and in the converting segment and a reduction of in total fiber cost 
cost of products sold was negatively affected in fiscal year by a million decrease in pension income allocated to cost of products sold 
our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  consisting primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year  of which million and million  respectively  were included in cost of products sold 
selling  administrative and general expenses 
fiscal year selling  administrative and general expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year fiscal year costs were negatively affected by increases in wages and associated fringes  legal and consulting fees associated with our reit conversion and sarbanes oxley compliance  depreciation and other costs associated with the implementation of our erp system  and by a million decrease in pension income 
loss on asset abandonment 
fiscal year included a million non cash charge for the loss on the write off of two paper machines

fiscal year operating profit was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year see selected segment results below 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes was million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year income before income taxes was favorably affected by a modest reduction of interest expense of million compared with fiscal year provision for taxes on income 
fiscal year provision for income taxes was million  reflecting a tax rate of 
fiscal year provision for income taxes was million  reflecting a tax rate of 
this decrease in the tax rate is the result of increased utilization of federal and state tax credits 
net income 
for the reasons noted above  net income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  representing a decrease 
selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet lumber  thousands of board feet logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lumber volume sold and a decrease in lumber prices  partially offset by a increase in log prices and an increase in log volume of 
lumber volume was down primarily due to our decision to optimize our total return and discontinue the processing of logs into lumber at a third party sawmill in oregon 
increases in log volume were driven by favorable harvest conditions 
domestic log price and volume increased and  respectively  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales  compared with million  or of timber net sales  for fiscal year the export sales decrease was due to a decrease in volume  partially offset by a increase in export log price 
log export prices continued to benefit from the dollar being relatively weak compared to the yen during the year 
the decline in export sales as a percent of total sales was due to increased domestic demand for export quality logs 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reasons for this decrease were higher logging and hauling costs  the decrease in lumber volume and a increase in depletion costs due to harvesting from counties with higher depletion rates 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating loss  millions paper  tons paperboard  tons paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increases in paper and paperboard volume of and  respectively 
paper prices increased while paperboard prices decreased 
domestic paper and paperboard volume was up and  respectively  while domestic prices were up and  respectively  as compared with fiscal year the strengthening of the us economy during fiscal year drove the improved demand 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to a increase in sales of pulp in the export market 
total export paper and paperboard volume was up  with paper volume up and paperboard volume up 
export paper prices increased  while export paperboard price went down due mainly to product mix  compared to year ago levels 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year this segment operating loss includes the million of the non cash cost for the write off of the and paper machines that was allocated to paper and paperboard in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as discussed further below 
without this large write off  the paper and paperboard operating loss would have been million 
the decrease in operating loss was primarily the result of improved machine operating rates for fiscal year  driving fixed costs per unit down 
our longview mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year operating results were also positively affected by improved labor productivity as indicated by a decrease in labor hours per ton of paper and paperboard produced 
operating results for fiscal year were also favorably impacted by our on going energy conservation efforts and by strategically utilizing our various fuel sources to mitigate increases in fuel costs  particularly natural gas costs  which resulted in a decrease in total energy cost per ton of production 
in addition  a decrease in total fiber cost  resulting from a reduction in the usage of purchased bleach pulp and a increase in usage of lower cost occ fibers  was partially offset by a increase in wood chip cost over fiscal year and the decrease in pension income 
our bpi initiatives to improve our longview mill optimization  improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower our procurement costs have also contributed favorably to the results 
during fiscal year  we utilized the paper machine from time to time to meet customer demand requirements  leaving two of our least efficient machines fully curtailed to match production with incoming orders 
after considerable review of current market conditions  future expectations and costs of operating and maintaining the and paper machines  management decided to permanently shut down those machines in response to several developments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year specifically  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the decision to outsource supply for a remote box plant in to reduce costs  thereby reducing production demand for linerboard 
we were also able to execute a new strategy of accumulating box plant inventory prior to seasonal demand so that we could dedicate a paper machine that had often been used to make corrugating medium to the production of kraft paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  reducing the need for the and paper machines 
finally  to improve margins  we reduced sales to one of our large kraft paper customers 
converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase converted products net sales  millions converted products operating loss  millions converted products  tons converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume increased and average price increased over fiscal year the increase in volume was primarily the result of improvement in the general domestic economy  which began in the latter part of fiscal year the converted products operating loss for fiscal year was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year this segment operating loss includes the million of the non cash cost for the write off of the and paper machines that was allocated to converted products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year without this large write off  converted products operating loss would have been million in fiscal year  reflecting primarily increased volume and price  coupled with a reduction in total labor hours per ton of production of  relative to fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year net sales increased as a result of increases in net sales in each of our operating segments our timber segment increased million  or  our paper and paperboard segment increased million  or  and our converted segment increased million  or 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of increased higher margin timber sales  led by log and lumber price increases and a reduction in logging and hauling costs of  net of the value of chips produced from pulp logs  partially offset by higher depletion cost 
cost of products sold was further favorably impacted by a reduction in energy cost per ton of production at our longview mill of  labor productivity gains as indicated by reductions in total labor hours per ton of production of at our longview mill and in the converting segment 
cost of products sold was negatively affected by a million decrease in pension income allocated to cost of products sold  a increase in total fiber cost and a million charge for the loss on the sale of our bag plants 
see selected segment results below 
our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year  of which million was included in cost of products sold for both fiscal years 
selling  administrative and general expenses 
fiscal year selling  administrative and general expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year fiscal year costs were negatively affected by increases in wages and associated fringes  legal and consulting fees  depreciation and other costs associated with the implementation of our erp system  and a decrease in allocated pension income

selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet lumber  thousands of board feet logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a increase in log volume sold and a increase in log prices  coupled with an increase in lumber prices of and an increase in lumber volume of 
increases in net sales were driven by the continuing strength of the us housing market and favorable harvest conditions 
domestic log price and volume increased and  respectively  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year the export sales increase was due to a increase in export log prices and a increase in volume 
log export prices continued to benefit from the dollar being relatively weak compared to the yen during the year 
the decline in export sales as a percent of total sales was due to domestic sales growth exceeding export sales growth 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reasons for this increase were the higher log and lumber prices and a decrease in total logging and hauling costs  net of the value of chips produced from pulp logs  partially offset by a increase in depletion costs due to harvesting from counties with higher depletion rates 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating loss  millions paper  tons paperboard  tons paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increases in paper and paperboard volume of and  respectively 
paper and paperboard prices remained relatively flat with paper decreasing and paperboard increasing 
domestic paper and paperboard volume was up and  respectively  while domestic prices declined and  respectively  as compared with fiscal year the strengthening of the us economy during fiscal year drove the improved demand 
domestic paperboard average price was affected by proportionately more corrugated medium being sold in fiscal year than in fiscal year and the addition of roll pulp sold in the export market 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year total export paper and paperboard volume was down  with paper volume down and paperboard volume up 
export paper and paperboard prices increased and  respectively  compared to year ago levels  due mainly to the weaker us dollar 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year the increase in operating loss was primarily the result of low machine operating rates for the first half of fiscal year  driving fixed costs per unit up 
in addition  operational problems in the first quarter of fiscal year caused productivity to decline 
our longview mill operations did improve steadily throughout the year with the fourth quarter of fiscal year operating at of capacity compared with only for the first quarter of fiscal year the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by a increase in total fiber cost  including a increase in occ costs and a increase in wood chip cost  and less pension income 
operating results for fiscal year were favorably impacted by paper and paperboard volume increases of and  respectively  and improved labor productivity as indicated by a decrease in labor hours per ton of paper and paperboard produced 
operating results were also positively affected by our on going energy conservation efforts and by strategically utilizing our various fuel sources to mitigate increases in fuel costs  particularly natural gas costs  which resulted in a decrease in total energy cost per ton of production at our longview mill 
during fiscal year  we restarted our paper machine  leaving the and paper machines  two of our least efficient machines  fully curtailed to match production with incoming orders 
our bpi initiatives to improve our longview mill optimization  improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower our procurement costs have contributed favorably to the results 
in first quarter of fiscal year  we renegotiated a long standing barter agreement whereby we swapped equivalent units of paper for paperboard 
the new buy sell agreement provides for our selling paper to the counterparty s converting facilities  and our purchase of paperboard from them for our converting facilities 
under the buy sell agreement  we began recording the sales of paper as sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year and million in the first three quarters of fiscal year effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and going forward  we are no longer recording these transactions as sales in our financial statements and instead are recording these transactions as an exchange using carryover basis as contemplated by accounting principles board bulletin no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb 
the table below shows the amount by quarter of sales and volume recorded for the buy sell agreements 
dollars in thousands fiscal sales tons st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter the impact of our accounting for these transactions as sales was not material to our operating profit and net income 
converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase converted products sales  millions converted products operating loss  millions converted products  tons converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume increased while average price remained at the levels of fiscal year the increase in volume was primarily the result of improvement in the general domestic economy in the latter part of fiscal year converted products price  although flat year over year  increased approximately from the second quarter of fiscal year low of per ton 
the converted products operating loss for fiscal year was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year the first two quarters of fiscal year accounted for million of the operating loss for fiscal year the increase in operating loss from converted products operations was due mainly to the higher cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting operations by our longview mill in the first two quarters of fiscal year  and an increased percentage of higher cost paperboard supplied to our converting operations by third party suppliers during fiscal year in october  we sold the equipment and working capital of our two paper bag operations for million in cash 
at the same time  we leased a portion of our spanish fork facility to the purchaser  who intends to continue to manufacture bags  and we will continue to supply paper for their operations 
the sale resulted in a million book loss to converted products operating profit 
by selling the two paper bag plants  which accounted for less than of our total sales and less than of converted products sales  we have completely exited a business we consider non core 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due primarily to lower working capital levels caused by reduced accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by reduced accounts payable 
accounts receivable decreased due to fewer days sales outstanding and lower levels of sales in the last two months of fiscal year as compared with fiscal year inventory levels and the related accounts payable were reduced as part of our ongoing business process improvement initiatives 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in working capital caused by the improved level of business activity during the latter part of the year 
net cash used for investing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our capital expenditures  including timberland acquisitions  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance  were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was attributable primarily to timber acquisitions made in that year 
capital expenditures for plant and equipment for fiscal year totaled million 
significant fiscal year capital expenditures for plant and equipment included the following improvements to manufacturing equipment to meet environmental requirements and to continue to burn less expensive biomass fuel  costs associated with further implementation of our erp  and improvements to our yakima box plant material handling system to improve throughput and reduce costs 
during fiscal year  we acquired  acres of timberland in numerous transactions for a total of million  of which the single largest purchase was  acres for million 
capital expenditures for plant and equipment for fiscal year totaled million including these projects that were completed during the year new equipment with in line graphics capabilities in our yakima  washington and bowling green  kentucky box plants  upgrades to the paper machine to improve the quality of our tea kraft high performance paper  an expansion and an upgrade to our occ recycling plant to increase capacity from approximately tons per day to approximately  tons per day  and adding electrostatic precipitators on our hogged fuel boilers to continue to burn less expensive bio mass fuel and meet environmental requirements 
we intend to continue to opportunistically acquire timberlands that improve our future yields and are available at prices that support their long term value 
such acquisitions may result in our exceeding our annual capital expenditure expectations  as in fiscal year capital project investments will be focused on high return projects  meeting customers needs  and environmental compliance 
we expect capital expenditures for timber purchases  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance to total approximately million to million for fiscal year net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the change for fiscal years   and primarily reflect a million  a million and a million decrease  respectively  in borrowings generally resulting from reduced capital expenditures and modest dividends compared to earlier years 
during each quarter of fiscal year  we determined the amount of our dividend based on operating results  current market conditions and debt levels 
during the fiscal year  we declared and paid per share in the aggregate amount of million 
beginning with the first calendar quarter of  we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock amounting to approximately per share  or per share on an annualized basis 
these per share amounts do not reflect the impact of the shares of our common stock to be issued in the e p distribution  which will increase the number of shares outstanding 
actual dividend payments on our common stock following the effectiveness of the reit conversion are subject to final board approval and will be based on our results of operations  cash flow and prospects at the time  as well as any contractual limitations in our debt instruments 
as a result  the level of dividends we pay could be less than expected 
at october   our total borrowed debt was million including long term debt of million and short term borrowings of million 
at october   we had million outstanding under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  excluding letters of credit of million 
in addition  we had million of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
also outstanding at october   were other various senior notes totaling million  and revenue bonds of million 
our financing arrangements at october  required us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  long term borrowing ratio  and fixed charge coverage ratio  and restrict our payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with such covenants at october  as described under new credit agreement  below  in december  we entered into a new credit agreement  repaid all outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and prepaid all of our outstanding senior notes 
we reduced borrowed debt to million at the end of fiscal year  from million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year our debt peaked at million at january  due to borrowings made in connection with substantial capital expenditures  as well as timberland acquisitions  dividends and stock repurchases in fiscal year and decreased operating profits in fiscal years and compared with fiscal year we have been able to reduce borrowed debt in fiscal year by million by maintaining a lower level of capital spending on new projects and by improving operating results through the implementation of our business process improvement initiatives and improved market conditions 
our dividend payouts were at modest levels while we prioritized the use of excess cash for debt reduction 
total deferred net gain on all terminated interest rate swap agreements relating to our senior subordinated notes was million and million at october  and  respectively 
the deferred gain is included in other long term liabilities in our balance sheet and will reduce interest expense over the term of our senior subordinated notes  which mature in the mark to market adjustment for the then outstanding interest rate swaps resulted in a derivative liability of  at october   with a corresponding adjustment to long term debt 
there were no interest rate swap agreements at october  contractual obligations expressed in thousands fiscal year total beyond long term debt a credit agreement b reforestation total a includes the following amounts under senior notes prepaid on december  million total  million  million and million 
b reflects obligations under our credit agreement  which we replaced with a new credit agreement on december   as described under new credit agreement  below 
in december  we completed the refinancing of a portion of our then existing indebtedness by prepaying our outstanding senior notes and entering into a new credit agreement 
see new credit agreement  below 
during  we intend to complete the refinancing of the balance of that indebtedness  consisting of the million of our senior subordinated notes outstanding 
in order to be eligible to elect reit status effective january   we will be required to complete the e p distribution by december  we anticipate that the e p distribution will be taxable as a dividend to our shareholders and will be valued between approximately million and million 
the aggregate amount of cash to be received by all shareholders in the e p distribution will be limited to approximately of the e p distribution 
for  we expect to finance the cash portion of the e p distribution  the retirement of the senior subordinated notes  working capital requirements  timberland acquisitions and other capital expenditures and dividend payments using cash flow generated from operations  borrowings under our credit agreement  proceeds from the issuance of debt and or equity securities or a combination of the foregoing 
new credit agreement on december   we entered into a credit agreement  dated as of december   with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  and various lenders from time to time party thereto 
longview fibre company and longview trs are the borrowers under the credit agreement and are jointly and severally liable for all borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires that any material subsidiaries of longview fibre company other than longview trs become parties to the credit agreement as guarantors 
this description of the credit agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the credit agreement  which is included as exhibit to this annual report on form k 
the credit agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility that comprises a million revolving facility  including provisions for i loans that may be requested on an expedited basis  called swingline loans  in a maximum aggregate amount of up to million and ii letters of credit in an aggregate undrawn face amount of up to million  and a million term facility 
the amount available for borrowings under the revolving facility at any particular time is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit then outstanding under the revolving facility 
at any time during the term of the credit agreement  we may request an increase in the commitments provided thereunder by an aggregate amount for all such requests of up to million  provided that we may make a maximum of three such requests 
any increase in the commitments would be applied pro rata across the revolving facility and the term facility 
a request by us for an increase in the commitments under the credit agreement would be met only if and to the extent that the administrative agent and we were successful in obtaining the agreement of particular lenders to provide new or additional commitments 
we may use borrowings under the credit agreement to fund a portion of the e p distribution  to repay existing indebtedness  to pay fees and expenses associated with our planned reit conversion and related refinancing  and for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  working capital and capital expenditures 
in december  we drew the full million available under the term facility to repay all million of outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility  to prepay the entire million principal amount of our then outstanding senior notes and to pay prepayment premiums  accrued interest and fees in connection with the prepayment of the senior notes 
the charge to december for prepayment premiums  unamortized debt issuance costs and fees was approximately million 
as of december   there was million in borrowings outstanding under the term facility  and no borrowings and million undrawn face amount of letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving facility 
at our option  each individual borrowing under the credit agreement may be designated and maintained as either base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans 
in addition  under the revolving facility  borrowings may be designated and maintained as swingline loans 
a swingline loan may remain outstanding for no more than business days 
for purposes of calculating interest base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of i the higher of a the applicable prime commercial rate and b the applicable federal funds rate plus  referred to as the alternate base rate  and ii a margin  referred to as the applicable margin  that varies according to the ratio of a our consolidated funded indebtedness to b our consolidated total capitalization  eurodollar rate loans  for which we may elect interest periods of one  two  three or six months  bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of i the applicable eurodollar interest rate and ii the applicable margin  and swingline loans  at the applicable borrower s option  bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either i the sum of a the alternate base rate and b the applicable margin or ii such other interest rate as to which we may agree with the swingline lender at the time of the borrowing 
interest is payable i in the case of any base rate loan  on the last business day of each calendar quarter and ii in the case of any eurodollar rate loan  at the end of each interest period except that  in the case of any eurodollar loan having an interest period of more than three months  interest is payable every three months 
the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans  initially  varies from to  and the applicable margin for base rate loans and swingline loans that bear interest based on the alternate base rate  initially  varies from zero to  in each case depending on the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to our consolidated total capitalization 
until we have delivered to the lenders financial statements and compliance certificates for the fiscal quarter ending june   the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans will be no less than  and the applicable margin for base rate loans and swingline loans that bear interest based on the alternate base rate will be no less than 
under the revolving facility  we are required to pay a commitment fee and a letter of credit fee to the lenders 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and computed as a percentage  initially  which varies from to depending on the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to our consolidated total capitalization subject to a minimum until we have delivered to the lenders financial statements and compliance certificates for the fiscal quarter ending june   of the average daily unused commitments  exclusive of swingline loans 
the letter of credit fee is also payable quarterly in arrears  is equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans and is computed on the face amount of any letter of credit issued and outstanding 
under the term facility  we are required to pay a ticking fee to the lenders  payable quarterly in arrears  from the period commencing upon the closing date and ending on the date the term facility is drawn in full  computed as a percentage  determined on the same basis as the commitment fee for the revolving facility  of the average daily unused commitments 
both the revolving facility and the term facility mature on december  no amortization payments are required 
under the term facility  we are required to make mandatory prepayments in the amount of of the net cash proceeds we receive from sales of our property and assets subject to customary exclusions  and of the net cash proceeds we receive in excess of a specified annual threshold amount in connection with a casualty  condemnation or eminent domain proceeding subject to customary exclusions  and  except as otherwise permitted under the credit agreement of the net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance or incurrence of any indebtedness  and of the net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance of additional equity interests  such exceptions to include specified issuances by us prior to december  of equity in connection with our planned reit conversion and our funding of permitted acquisitions 
at our option  we are permitted to prepay all or part of the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement without premium or penalty  but subject to payment of customary breakage charges 
additionally  we may cancel the unused portion of any commitments under the revolving facility at any time 
our obligations under the credit agreement will be secured by first priority perfected liens and security interests on portions of our timberland holdings  together with all proceeds and products thereof  designated by the lenders and having an aggregate collateral value of at least two times the total commitments under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains a number of customary restrictive covenants subject to baskets for permitted transactions and materiality  knowledge and other qualifications  including  among others  covenants related to maintenance by us of qualification as a reit and limitations on liens  mergers  consolidations  sales of assets  incurrence of debt  capital expenditures  investments including loans and advances and acquisitions and transactions with affiliates 
the only limitations on our making dividend distributions are  in the case of any such distribution excluding distributions necessary solely to qualify for or maintain reit status  i the absence of any event of default under the credit agreement in existence at the time of  or caused by  such distribution  ii a requirement that  at the time of such distribution  we be in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement and iii a requirement that such distribution be permitted under the terms of the indenture governing any senior unsecured notes we issue 
under the credit agreement  we are required to comply with financial performance covenants  including a maximum total debt to capitalization ratio of with a step down to after one year  a maximum interest coverage ratio of to and a maximum ratio of commitments under the credit agreement to collateral value of 
we are also required to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth excluding the effect of future non cash asset impairment charges of up to million equal to or greater than the applicable amount as follows from the closing date to but not including the date of the declaration of the e p distribution  of our consolidated net worth as of july   from the date of the declaration of the e p distribution to but not including the first business day after the date on which we deliver to the lenders financial statements and compliance certificates for the fiscal quarter in which the e p distribution occurred  of our consolidated net worth as of july   less the amount by which our consolidated net worth is reduced as a direct result of the declaration of the e p distribution  and from the first business day after the date on which we deliver financial statements and compliance certificates for the fiscal quarter in which the declaration of the e p distribution occurred and thereafter  of our consolidated net worth as of the last day of the fiscal quarter during which the date of the declaration of the e p distribution occurred 
the minimum consolidated net worth requirement would be increased at the end of each fiscal quarter on a cumulative basis by the amount of the net cash proceeds from any equity issuances we consummated during that fiscal quarter 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default subject to materiality and other qualifications and grace periods 
the events of default include nonpayment of principal  interest  fees or other amounts under the credit agreement  any representation or warranty of ours under the credit agreement proving to have been materially incorrect when made or deemed to have been made  failure by us to comply with credit agreement covenants  specified defaults by us under other indebtedness  specified bankruptcy and insolvency events  specified events involving the entry of judgments against us  actual or asserted invalidity of any loan documentation under the credit agreement  a change of control  and specified events related to our compliance with the employee retirement income security act 
upon an event of a default under the credit agreement  the requisite number of lenders or the administrative agent at their request may declare all amounts owing under the credit agreement immediately due and payable  terminate the lenders commitments to make loans under the credit agreement  require that we cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations and or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the credit agreement 
for specified defaults related to insolvency and receivership  the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement will terminate automatically  all outstanding loans and other amounts will become immediately due and payable and our obligation to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations will automatically become effective 
other we continually review any known environmental exposures including the cost of remediation 
at the present time  we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality  the epa has issued a final version of the cluster rule 
we estimate that additional capital expenditures required to comply with this regulatory program will range from million to million for the coming fiscal year 
the applicable requirements for primarily impact our pulp washing operations at their existing levels of production  and we may be required to alter our production process  replace existing equipment or install additional pollution control equipment if either our production levels increase to certain levels or if our proposed actions are not found to be sufficiently effective 
if we are required to pursue these actions  we estimate this will result in capital costs of up to an additional million 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures associated with achieving or maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations  including the amounts required to comply with the cluster rule  and approximately million on operating and other non capitalizable expenditures relating to environmental matters 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty and could continue to escalate because of continuing changes in laws and regulations and uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and applied  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
regulations have been developed to protect certain species of plants  fish and wildlife in oregon and washington 
these regulations restrict the harvest of timber near streams and other environmentally sensitive areas  thereby reducing the timber that can be harvested and increasing costs 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  other than previously entering into the interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our past interest rate swap agreements 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our critical accounting policies are those that may require a higher level of judgment  estimates and complexity 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those that deal with pension expense and income  impairment of long lived assets  and depletion 
pension assumptions used in the determination of pension income  including the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation are evaluated by us  reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results from operations 
we base our discount rate assumptions on rates of return on long term high quality bonds 
as of october   the company s discount rate was  which will be used in the determination of net periodic pension income for fiscal year as of october   the company reduced its discount rate to from to reflect decreases in rates of return on high quality bonds  which were declining beginning since fiscal year net periodic pension income for fiscal year was based on the assumed discount rate 
as of october   the company reduced its discount rate to from to reflect decreases in rates of return on high quality bonds 
net periodic pension income for fiscal year was based on the assumed discount rate 
our assumption regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected average rates of return for current asset classes in the plan investment portfolio 
the expected rate of return used in determining net periodic pension income for fiscal year was as compared to used for fiscal years and the expected rate of return for fiscal year will be changed to from to reflect future expected returns for the portfolio and will be used in determining net periodic pension income for that fiscal year 
at the end of fiscal year  the plan s assets consisted of approximately equities and other assets 
the change to the discount rate effective october   contributed million to the reduction in net periodic pension income for fiscal year the changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return effective october  contributed million to the reduction in net periodic pension income for fiscal year long lived assets an impairment of a long lived asset exists when the carrying value is not recoverable through future operations and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations 
to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset group is impaired  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group and the likelihood of the outcomes 
if the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable through the future cash flows  it is considered impaired 
an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
during fiscal year  we utilized the paper machine from time to time to meet customer demand requirements  leaving two of our least efficient machines fully curtailed to match production with incoming orders 
after considerable review of current market conditions  future expectations and costs of operating and maintaining the and paper machines  management decided to permanently shut down those machines in response to several developments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year specifically  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the decision to outsource supply for a remote box plant in to reduce costs  thereby reducing production demand for linerboard 
we were also able to execute a new strategy of accumulating box plant inventory prior to seasonal demand so that we could dedicate a paper machine that had often been used to make corrugating medium to the production of kraft paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  reducing the need for the and paper machines 
finally  to improve margins  we reduced sales to one of our large kraft paper customers 
depletion assumptions and estimates are used to record merchantable timberland inventory and to calculate depletion costs attributed to timber harvested 
merchantable timber is defined by the company as timber with an age of or more years 
the volume of merchantable timber is estimated using industry standard computer software to track growth and is adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions 
volume estimates are confirmed through periodic timber cruises  a physical measurement of timber on a specific set of acres 
costs subject to depletion include the original cost of the timber  as well as capital reforestation expenditures such as site preparation and tree planting related to merchantable age timber  less depletion previously recorded 
depletion rates are determined by dividing the unamortized cost of timber by the estimated volume of timber of merchantable age 
rates of depletion are adjusted every five years for growth and harvest  and are adjusted for any significant acquisition or disposition of timber at the time of such occurrence 
a change in estimated timber inventory volume would have changed depletion expense by approximately million

cyclical industry conditions and commodity pricing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results reflect the general cyclical and seasonal pattern of the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
most of our products are commodity products and are subject to competition from other timber companies and paper and paperboard products manufacturers worldwide 
historically  prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest  paper and packaging products industries  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of other factors 
the demand for our timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity 
demand for our paper and packaging products is primarily affected by the state of the global economy in general and the economies in north america and east asia in particular 
a prolonged and severe weakness in the markets for one or more of our principal products could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our cash requirements  including the payment of interest and principal on our debt  as well as our ability to pay dividends 
our industries are highly competitive and subject to wide price fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest  paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally  including significant competition from non wood and engineered wood products  and no single company is dominant 
these industries have suffered  and continue to suffer  from excess capacity 
profitability of our manufacturing segment depends in part on our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities efficiently  and our longview mill near full capacity 
during fiscal year  our longview mill operated at of capacity 
these industries are also capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
our competitors include large  vertically integrated forest  paper and packaging products companies and numerous smaller companies 
larger companies that compete with us in each of our markets may be better able to withstand the adverse nature of the business cycle because they may have greater financial and operating resources than we do  have less leverage than we do and own more timberland than we do 
in the past  we have seen significant competition in our export markets as our global competitors have benefited from the strength of the us dollar relative to their currencies 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition and volatility within our industry  especially during periods of reduced demand 
during fiscal years and  the us dollar weakened 
this development had a positive effect on our export business  particularly on european competition in the japanese lumber market where japanese buyers had an advantage purchasing us wood products 
strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of our global competitors now or in the future  could adversely affect our operating results 
these factors  coupled with our leveraged position  may harm our ability to respond to competition and other market conditions 
tariffs  quotas or trade agreements can also affect the markets for our products  particularly our wood products 
for example  in  the united states imposed duties on imported softwood lumber from canada in response to a dispute over the stumpage pricing policies of some provincial governments 
canada is challenging the tariffs in a number of forums  seeking to force the united states to revoke the import duty and return more than billion in deposits collected on imports since duties were first imposed 
both countries are pursuing their own independent litigation and administrative remedies 
in december  the united states reduced its duties on imported canadian softwood lumber 
this reduction  or any further reductions  in duties on imported canadian softwood lumber could put downward pressure on prices in the united states 
price fluctuations in raw materials could adversely affect our ability to cost effectively obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products 
the most significant raw material used in our operations is fiber  including wood  recycled and other fiber  which during fiscal year accounted for of our costs of products produced in our paper and paperboard segment  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight 
we obtained approximately of our wood fiber requirements at open market prices during fiscal year we also obtained almost all of our recycled fiber on the open market 
wood and recycled fiber are both subject to commodity pricing  which fluctuates on the basis of market factors over which we have no control 
in addition  the cost of fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions  particularly the conditions in the pacific northwest  where we purchase most of our fiber 
further  our access to wood fiber could be adversely affected by consolidation of sawmills in the pacific northwest that supply wood fiber to our longview mill  mill closures due to oversupplied domestic lumber markets  as well as more stringent environmental or other regulations affecting the supply or cost of timber to those sawmills 
we may not be able to pass any future raw material cost increases through to our customers through product price increases 
increased costs of raw materials  and our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our operations require substantial capital and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
our operations require substantial capital 
capital requirements for expansion  replacement and maintenance of existing facilities or equipment or to comply with existing and future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial 
the regular periodic and scheduled maintenance we perform on our equipment may not obviate the need to repair or replace key pieces of equipment  and we could incur significant additional costs associated with environmental compliance 
the costs of repairing or replacing equipment and the associated downtime of an affected production line could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
if our future capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs  capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures and liabilities 
our businesses are subject to many federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the restoration and reforestation of timberlands  harvesting timber near waterways  discharges of pollutants and emissions  and the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances or other contaminants 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business and we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenditures to remain in compliance 
for instance  in fiscal year we expect to incur approximately million of capital expenditures and approximately million of operating and other non capitalizable expenditures relating to environmental matters 
we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million to million over the next three years to further reduce air emissions and decrease the possibility of future air violations 
we expect that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will become more stringent and more stringently enforced in the future and may reduce the amount of timber available for harvesting 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
in washington state  we are required to file a forest practice application for each unit of timber to be harvested 
these applications may be denied or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties  including citizen groups 
appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits 
delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
consequently  we cannot be sure that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination  including unanticipated discovery of contamination or discharges of hazardous substances  will not require significant expenditures by us or that internally generated funds or other sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
some environmental laws permit individuals  citizens groups and other third parties to file claims against us based upon alleged violations of laws or damages to property stemming from contamination  or upon alleged injury to persons stemming from exposure to hazardous substances used or otherwise controlled by us 
we may be required to expend significant sums to defend and or settle existing or future claims 
environmental groups and other interested individuals may intervene in the regulatory processes in the states where we own timberlands 
in washington state  environmental groups and other interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the forest practices board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved 
the same persons may also file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from implementing our operating plans  including seeking orders entirely preventing or restricting our ability to harvest our timberlands 
delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results 
forestry regulations  including regulations intended to protect threatened and endangered species  restrict timber harvesting and may otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our timberlands business 
the federal endangered species act and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction 
protection of endangered species habitat includes restrictions on timber harvesting and related activities 
a number of species indigenous to the pacific northwest have already been protected under the endangered species act  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  mountain caribou  grizzly bear  goshawk  bald eagle  and various anadromous fish species 
some of these species  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  and goshawk  are found in some of our timberlands  requiring us to adjust the harvest schedules on some of our timberland resources 
additional species within our timberlands could subsequently receive protected status under the endangered species act or more members of species currently protected could be discovered within our timberlands  requiring us to refrain from harvesting timber on additional acres 
our timberlands may also become subject to laws and regulations designed to protect wetlands  which laws and regulations could restrict harvesting  road building and other activities 
high energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
energy costs are a significant variable operating expense for us and are susceptible to rapid and substantial price increases and volatility 
our costs for energy are currently at relatively high levels and could rapidly increase 
should energy costs increase in future periods  we may not be able to pass all increased energy costs through to our customers 
in addition  the primary contracts pursuant to which we advantageously purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under current terms  we have less flexibility in our ability to mitigate the costs of energy used by our facilities 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies and offshore manufacturing could result in fluctuations in the price of and the demand for our products 
while all of our sales are made in us dollars  a portion of our sales are made to customers operating in markets that use currencies other than us dollars 
for the fiscal year  exports accounted for approximately of our total sales 
of this amount  of our total sales came from log export sales  all to japan  and of our total sales came from export sales of paper and paperboard  primarily to hong kong  canada and southeast asia 
in fiscal year  the continued weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries has helped our products be more competitive in the export market 
however  strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries could make it more expensive for our customers operating in foreign markets to purchase our products  could make our products less price competitive with our foreign competitors  and could consequently reduce the demand for our products 
in addition  adverse currency valuations could make paper and paperboard from foreign competitors more price competitive in the us market 
this situation has caused  and from time to time in the future may cause  excess supply of paper and paperboard in the united states  which  in turn  would likely result in a decrease in us paper and paperboard prices 
historically  a stronger us dollar has been associated with migration of domestic manufacturing to offshore locations 
if further migration of domestic manufacturing to offshore locations occurs  we could be adversely affected by the impact of the migration on the pricing of and demand for our products domestically 
natural disasters or other events may cause losses to our timber holdings or limit our ability to harvest our timber 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters and other events such as fire  volcanic eruptions  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss of our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
in addition  fire and other natural disasters in adjacent or nearby timberlands may limit our access to  or impede our ability to  harvest our timber 
in periods of poor logging conditions  we may harvest less timber than expected  thus impacting our net sales of timber during that period 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions and economically unfavorable collective bargaining agreements 
approximately  employees  or more than of our workforce  are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  there is a risk of work stoppage due to strikes or walkouts 
we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at various times from calendar year through calendar year  including a collective bargaining agreement with our  longview mill employees that extends to may  any significant work stoppage as a result of the failure to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements or the inability to negotiate new agreements on economically beneficial terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
since we do not have pulp and paper production elsewhere  a material disruption at our mill could result in a material disruption of our paper making operations 
such disruptions could be caused by prolonged power failures  a breakdown of our continuous pulp digesters or recovery furnaces  chemical spill or release  disruption of raw material supply  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including railroad tracks  bridges  pipelines  tunnels and roads  or fires  floods  earthquakes  volcanic eruption or other disasters 
the business insurance and replacement value insurance we carry could prove to be inadequate to cover the total amount of any losses caused by any of the above events 
in addition  we are not insured against any losses due to interruptions in our business due to damage to or destruction of our longview pulp and paper making complex caused by earthquakes or to major transportation infrastructure disruptions or other events that do not occur on our premises 
a disruption in our pulp and paper operations would also adversely affect our converting plants  which in fiscal year effectively obtained approximately of their paperboard requirements from our longview mill either by direct shipment from our longview mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements with third parties 
changes in supply  caused by changes in the policies of governmental agencies  may affect timber prices and our revenues 
some governmental agencies  principally the us department of agriculture forest service and the us department of the interior s bureau of land management  own large amounts of timberlands 
if these agencies choose to sell more timber than they have been selling in recent years  timber prices could fall 
our operating and financial performance are dependent upon key personnel 
we believe that our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities or our senior operating management team 
a failure to retain the members of our senior operating management team could adversely affect our operating and financial performance 
a significant portion of the timberlands that we own and manage is concentrated in a limited geographic area 
we own and manage approximately  acres of timberlands in nine tree farms in oregon and washington 
accordingly  if the level of production from these tree farms substantially declines  because of adverse growing or harvesting conditions in the northwest or otherwise  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues 
we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec collectively  section require us to assess and report on our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  beginning with our fiscal year ended october  in our initial report under section  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of october  because of several material weaknesses that existed as of that date 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or a combination of control deficiencies  that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
material weaknesses could adversely affect our financial reporting process and our financial statements 
failure to achieve and maintain  or unanticipated costs incurred to achieve and maintain  an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and or stock price 
we are subject to different risks than reits in other industries 
we are subject to certain risks that are not applicable to reits focused on other types of property  because of our ownership of timberlands and our manufacturing operations 
for example  while many other reits derive substantial portions of their cash flow from leases or other contracts providing for relatively stable payments  our cash flow and ability to maintain or increase dividends will be substantially dependent upon the market price for our timber and market prices for our manufactured products that have historically been volatile 
we are also subject to other risks discussed above which are not typically relevant to reits but which are applicable to us  including risks associated with uninsured losses from natural disasters such as fire  volcanic eruptions  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes  and the risk that regulatory changes  such as those designed to protect threatened and endangered species  could restrict timber harvesting in the future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit  we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders and our income will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates 
our board of directors has authorized us to take the steps necessary to elect to be taxed as a reit effective for our taxable year commencing january   subject to a final determination by our board of directors that we elect reit status with our tax return for the tax year beginning january  however  we may not be able to qualify  or maintain qualification  as a reit 
our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset  income  organizational  distribution  shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis 
our ability to satisfy the asset tests will depend upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets  some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination 
our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis 
the irs could contend that our ownership interests in longview trs  securities of other issuers or other assets would give rise to a violation of the reit requirements 
if in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income  and we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
in addition  we will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions 
as a result  net income and the funds available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer  which would have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate  we could reduce or eliminate dividends on our common stock 
because of the expected nature of our income  we may not be required to distribute material amounts of cash to qualify as a reit 
reits generally are required to distribute of their ordinary taxable income  but not their net capital gains income 
as a reit  we expect that  for the foreseeable future  our income will consist primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments we receive under timber cutting contracts 
we could elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of our net capital gains and still maintain our status as a reit 
to the extent that we elect to retain our net capital gains we would be required to pay the tax on such gains at regular corporate rates  our shareholders  although required to include their proportionate share of the undistributed capital gain in income  would receive a refundable credit for their share of the federal income tax paid by us  and the basis of a shareholder s stock would be increased by the amount of the undistributed capital gains minus the amount of the federal income tax on capital gains paid by us which was included in income by the shareholder 
the timing and amounts of our dividends have varied 
our board of directors has significantly changed our dividend policy in anticipation of the reit conversion 
beginning in the first calendar quarter of  we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock amounting to approximately per share  or per share on an annualized basis 
these per share amounts do not reflect the impact of the shares of our common stock that will be issued to our shareholders in the e p distribution 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  will determine the amount and frequency of dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments  future acquisitions and divestitures  harvest levels  changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands 
consequently  our dividend levels may fluctuate  and the level of dividends we pay could be less than expected 
if we lower our dividend or elect or are required to retain rather than distribute our income  our stock price could be adversely affected 
as a reit  we will be limited in our ability to fund dividend payments using cash generated through longview trs 
our ability to receive dividends from longview trs from which we would make distributions to our shareholders is limited by the rules we must comply with to maintain our status as a reit 
in particular  at least of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income 
no more than of our gross income may consist of dividends from longview trs and other non qualifying types of income 
as a result  even if our non reit activities conducted through longview trs were to become highly profitable  we might be limited in our ability to receive distributions from longview trs in an amount required to fund dividends to our shareholders commensurate with that profitability 
the historical market price of our common shares may not be indicative of the market price of our common shares following the e p distribution and reit conversion 
our historical share price may not be indicative of how the market will value our common shares after our election to be taxed as a reit and the e p distribution because of the effect of the actual distribution of shares of our common stock and cash in connection with the e p distribution  our reit dividend policy and other factors 
our historical share price did not necessarily reflect these factors  and our share price after the reit conversion and the e p distribution could be lower than the historical trading price of our shares 
our current stock price also is affected by general market conditions  the yield from distributions on our common stock relative to yields of other instruments and the economic and market perception of reit stocks 
because the timing of the reit conversion is not certain  we may not realize the anticipated tax benefits from the reit conversion effective january  the timing of the reit conversion depends on our ability to successfully complete the required transactions for qualification as a reit 
we anticipate that the reit conversion will be effective no later than january   but the effective date of the conversion could be delayed 
if the transactions contemplated by the conversion are ineffective  we may not be qualified to elect reit status effective january  in that event  the benefits attributable to our status as a reit  including our ability to reduce our corporate level federal income tax  would not commence january   and we would continue to pay corporate level income taxes in in addition  any delay in our ability to qualify as a reit could affect our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at the level contemplated by our new dividend policy 
there are uncertainties relating to the estimate of the e p distribution 
in order to qualify as a reit  we will be required to make the e p distribution prior to the end of our first taxable year as a reit  which we expect will be the taxable period ending december  failure to make the e p distribution before december  would result in our failure to qualify as a reit for the tax year ending december  the determination of the amount to be distributed in the e p distribution is a complex factual and legal determination 
we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or may interpret the applicable law differently than the irs 
we currently believe and intend that our e p distribution will equal the amount required to be distributed in order to satisfy the requirements relating to the distribution of e p 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of our e p distribution  including the possibility that the irs could  in any audits for tax years through  successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased  which would increase our e p 
thus  we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our e p by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
moreover  we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of certain procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our e p or the economic impact on us of doing so 
we intend that the e p distribution will be a taxable dividend  notwithstanding any elections by shareholders to receive all or part of their portion of the e p distribution in the form of stock rather than cash 
we intend that the entire amount of the e p distribution received by each shareholder will be treated for tax purposes as a taxable dividend  regardless of whether the shareholder receives the e p distribution in the form of cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
therefore  a shareholder that receives its portion of the e p distribution entirely in the form of shares of our common stock would generally be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received a taxable dividend from us  as would a shareholder that receives its portion of the e p distribution entirely in cash or partly in cash and partly in the form of shares of our common stock 
the e p distribution could be treated for tax purposes as a nontaxable stock dividend  which would preclude an effective distribution of e p 
we believe that the e p distribution will be taxable in its entirety 
however  the irs could argue that the imposition of the limit on the cash component of the e p distribution causes a portion of the common stock component of the e p distribution to be treated as a non taxable stock dividend 
treatment of a portion of the common stock component of the e p distribution as a non taxable stock dividend would reduce the amount of our e p distributed through the e p distribution  and might require us to incur additional expenses and make an additional distribution when we lack the financial wherewithal to do so  or at a time when the tax rate would be less advantageous to our shareholders 
an irs assertion that the distribution of common stock was not a taxable distribution  if successful  would also result in a holder not having been required to recognize income 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to the e p distribution  and the statements and conclusions described above are not binding on the irs 
the extent of our proposed use of longview trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 
we conduct a portion of our business activities through longview trs 
longview trs is a corporation subject to corporate level tax 
our use of longview trs enables us to engage in non reit qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of specialty paper and containers  sales of timberlands as a dealer and sales of logs 
however  under the code  no more than of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of subsidiaries that are trss 
this limitation may affect our ability to make investments in non reit qualifying operations 
furthermore  our use of longview trs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits  which may not use trss as extensively as we will use them 
our management has never operated a reit  and our future performance could be impaired as a result 
none of our officers and directors has prior experience managing or operating a reit 
compliance with the highly complex reit rules may divert our management team s attention form other business concerns 
our management team may be unable to replicate or exceed our historical performance while operating under the constraints imposed by reit qualification rules 
lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own  directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules  or more of its outstanding voting shares 
although it is not required by law or the reit provisions of the code  many existing reits have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which prevent five or fewer individuals from owning  directly or indirectly  or more of the outstanding voting shares of these entities 
we do not have  nor do we currently plan on adopting  share ownership and transfer restrictions 
as a result  the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire or more of our outstanding voting shares  which could result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax or corporate level tax 
reits are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the code  which for longview fibre company generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio  growing timber  and selling standing timber 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale by us of wood products  containers  kraft paper  paperboard  certain types of timberlands sales  if any  and the harvest and sales of logs conducted through longview trs  because such activities generate non qualifying reit income  could constitute prohibited transactions if such activities were engaged in directly by the reit 
in general  prohibited transactions are defined by the code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
by conducting our business in this manner  we believe we will satisfy the reit requirements of the code and avoid the tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction 
we may not always be successful  however  in limiting such activities to longview trs 
therefore  we could be subject to the prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur 
the net income of longview trs will be subject to corporate level income tax 
we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
if  during the ten year period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which we qualified as a reit expected to be january   we recognize gain on the disposition of any property other than the sale of standing timber pursuant to a timber cutting contract that we held as of such date  then  to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of such date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of such date  we will be required to pay a corporate level federal income tax on such gain at the highest regular corporate rate 
although we have no present intention to dispose of any property in a manner that would trigger such tax consequences  such dispositions could occur in the future 
in addition  the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualify as a reit  in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties  if any 
moreover  any such increase in taxable income will result in an increase in accumulated e p  which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then existing shareholders within days of the relevant determination 
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury 
changes to the tax laws  which may have retroactive application  could adversely affect our investors or us 
we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us 
new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
an investment in our common shares involves other tax issues 
we may face other tax liabilities as a reit that reduce our cash flow 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  or to avert the imposition of a tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory  we hold some of our assets through longview trs 
longview trs is a corporation subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
state tax laws may not conform to federal tax law 
though we expect to qualify as a reit in for federal income tax purposes  our qualification as a reit under the laws of each individual state will depend  among other things  on that state s conformity with federal tax law 
in the case of a shareholder living in a state whose tax laws do not conform to the federal tax treatment of reits  even if we do not do business in that state  cash distributions to that shareholder may be characterized as ordinary income rather than capital gains for purposes of computing that shareholder s state taxes 
investors should consult with their tax advisors concerning the state tax consequences of an investment in our common shares 
capital gains distributions to non us shareholders are generally subject to withholding 
we anticipate that our reit distributions that are taxable to our shareholders  other than the e p distribution  will primarily be treated as capital gains 
under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act  which applies to non us shareholders  capital gain distributions are generally subject to withholding at a rate of to non us shareholders who own more than of our common stock and to other non us shareholders unless  in each case  reduced as provided by an applicable income tax treaty 
these distributions may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a non us shareholder that is a corporation 
since the total cash payable to shareholders in the e p distribution will be limited  a shareholder s receipt of cash may be dependent on the election of others 
we plan on limiting the total amount of cash available for the e p distribution to approximately of the e p distribution 
the total amount of cash distributed will depend upon the extent to which our shareholders elect to receive cash rather than shares of our common stock 
if the total amount of cash elected by our shareholders exceeds the maximum cash available in the e p distribution  then the available cash may  to some extent  be prorated among our shareholders making cash elections 
therefore  a particular shareholder may not receive the proportions of the dividend that he or she elects 
our inability to obtain third party consents may have a material adverse effect 
we are required to obtain third party consents in connection with the december  transfer of non reit qualifying assets to longview trs 
these include consents of lenders  customers  suppliers and others with whom we have a contractual relationship  as well as consents of governmental authorities to the transfer of permits and licenses to longview trs 
given the number of and the length of time it takes to obtain consents  we may complete the reit conversion prior to completing the process of obtaining consents 
our completion of the reit conversion without our obtaining all such consents could cause a default under some of our contractual arrangements or prevent us from conducting operations for which permits or licenses are required 
if we were unable to obtain all third party consents  or a third party claims we should have obtained consent prior to the transfer of the non reit assets and business  we may lose the ability to use particular assets or lose our contractual rights  such as the ability to sell under favorable terms to a particular customer or buy from a particular supplier 
any loss of the ability to use an asset or operate part of our business or any loss of a contractual relationship may adversely affect our business 
we could lack access to funds to meet our distribution and tax obligations 
in addition to the e p distribution requirement  to the extent we do not meet reit income distribution requirements  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the undistributed amount 
we also could be required to pay taxes and liabilities attributable to periods and events prior to the reit conversion and additional taxes in the event we were to fail to qualify as a reit 
in addition  unless we elect to retain earnings  we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity 
the amount of funds  if any  available to us could be insufficient to meet our distribution and tax obligations 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our stock 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments  including investments in the businesses to be conducted by longview trs 
the e p distribution is expected to be taxable to our shareholders and could lead to increased selling pressure on our common stock 
we expect to distribute between approximately million and million to our shareholders in the e p distribution 
we expect that a minimum of approximately of the value of the e p distribution will be paid in shares of our common stock 
the e p distribution is expected to be taxable to our shareholders 
our shareholders may elect to sell some or all of their shares in anticipation of or following the e p distribution to satisfy their tax liabilities resulting from the e p distribution 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the marketplace could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the tax treatment for our dividends may fluctuate and may vary among different types of investors  which may change their value to some investors 
as a reit  we expect that  for the foreseeable future  our income will consist primarily of net capital gains 
a shareholder may offset such gains with the shareholder s capital losses from other sources  if any 
a portion of our dividends may be treated as qualified dividends eligible for the maximum rate for individuals or ordinary income 
moreover  our dividends as a reit will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction that is otherwise available to us shareholders that are domestic corporations other than s corporations  and corporate shareholders that receive our dividends may be subject to certain other special rules 
these treatments may have different tax consequences to different investors  which may affect the after tax value of our dividends 
we have substantial debt that could reduce the effectiveness of our operations 
we have a large amount of debt outstanding 
at october   our fiscal year end  we had million of borrowed debt 
this substantial level of debt could have important consequences  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  including debt service requirements  placing us at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements  limiting our ability to use cash flow from operations for capital expenditures  working capital  dividends to shareholders and other purposes  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities  including our ability to make strategic acquisitions  and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in our business  our industry or government regulation 
borrowings under our new credit agreement  which we signed in december  bear interest at variable rates 
if these rates increase significantly  our ability to borrow additional funds could be reduced  and the risks related to our substantial indebtedness would intensify 
our indebtedness imposes restrictions on us that may adversely affect our business operations and our ability to service our debt 
our debt instruments include covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock  repurchase capital stock  make loans and investments  allow restrictions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make distributions  dispose of assets  merge or consolidate with other entities  enter new lines of business  enter into transactions with affiliates  and create liens on our assets 
our credit agreement subjects us to maintenance requirements with respect to financial ratios  including that our net worth be maintained above a specified minimum and that our total debt to capitalization ratio not exceed a specified maximum 
these covenants in our debt instruments could restrict our ability to expand or to fully pursue our business strategies and opportunities 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our debt obligations may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in general business and economic conditions  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of any applicable debt covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness  which could cause those obligations to become immediately due and payable 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may be unable to repay it 
provisions in our organizational documents  applicable laws and debt instruments and other contractual arrangements could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws  applicable washington laws  and our shareholder rights plan  debt instruments and other contractual arrangements could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  various of the foregoing permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with rights and preferences designated by our board  impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings  divide our board of directors into three classes of directors serving staggered terms  limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors  allow the board of directors to fill any vacancies on our board  limit shareholders ability to call special meetings of shareholders and to take action by written consent without a meeting  prohibit us from consummating a significant business transaction with any person who acquires of our voting stock for a period of five years from the date such acquiring person makes such an acquisition unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of our board of directors prior to the time of the acquisition  with certain exceptions  require an affirmative vote of two thirds of our shareholders to approve a merger  share exchange or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets not in the ordinary course of business and provide for dissenters rights under several of the same circumstances  provide that any amendment to our articles of incorporation reducing to less than two thirds the percentage of votes necessary to approve a merger  share exchange  sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business or dissolution is not effective unless such amendment is approved by two thirds of all the votes entitled to vote  and this provision is protected by the same supermajority voting provision  require that  in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under our shareholder rights plan become exercisable to purchase our common stock and potentially other securities at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price  and may require upon specified types of change in control that we repurchase our outstanding debt securities 
these provisions and similar provisions that could apply to us in the future may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or otherwise adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
such provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  other than our entering into interest rate swaps from time to time to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
at october   there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our recent interest rate swap activities 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities and under interest rate swap agreements in which we enter from time to time 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october
