additional hurricane related losses may be recorded in future periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to reinsurers are processed

however  any adverse rulings could result in an increase in the company s hurricane related claim exposure and losses 
based on information currently known by management  it does not believe that additional claim losses resulting from hurricane katrina will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i investment impairments  ii the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  iii application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  iv the fair value of and accounting for derivatives  v the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac  including value of business acquired voba  vi the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  vii the liability for future policyholder benefits  viii accounting for reinsurance transactions  ix the liability for litigation and regulatory matters  and x accounting for employee benefit plans 
the application of purchase accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical estimates 
in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  mortgage and consumer loans  other limited partnerships  and real estate and real estate joint ventures  all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on i valuation methodologies  ii securities the company deems to be comparable  and iii assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in addition  the company enters into certain structured investment transactions  real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships for which the company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary and  therefore  may be required to consolidate such investments 
the accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party 
derivatives the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions primarily to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to the company s financial assets and liabilities 
the company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
the company also purchases investment securities  issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives 
the associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income which can result from i changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as accounting hedges  ii ineffectiveness of designated hedges  and iii counterparty default 
in addition  there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation are not identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives is complex  as evidenced by significant authoritative interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under the circumstances 
such assumptions include estimated volatility and interest rates used in the determination of fair value where quoted market values are not available 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of that business  are deferred 
the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
the amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  morbidity  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs 
the aforementioned factors enter into management s estimates of gross margins and profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
voba  included in dac  reflects the estimated fair value of in force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the insurance and annuity contracts in force at the acquisition date 
voba is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred 
in addition  the company utilizes the reversion to the mean assumption  a common industry practice  in its determination of the amortization of dac 
this practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but that it does change when large interim deviations have occurred 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment  or a business that is one level below the operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  goodwill within corporate other is allocated to reporting units within the company s business segments 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple or discounted cash flow model 
the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings  comparative market multiples and the discount rate 
liability for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns and inflation 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
the company also establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty claim insurance which represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company must review all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 
litigation the company is a party to a number of legal actions and regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease  the jurisdiction of claims filed  tort reform efforts and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the review includes senior legal and financial personnel 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the reported expense and liability associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plan and its assets  and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm 
these assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
financial condition as a result of the travelers acquisition  management of the company increased significantly the size and scale of the company s core insurance and annuity products and expanded the company s presence in both the retirement savings domestic and international markets 
the distribution agreements executed with citigroup as part of the acquisition will provide the company with one of the broadest distribution networks in the industry 
the travelers assets and liabilities acquired of billion and billion  respectively  have been included in the consolidated balance sheet of the company at their estimated fair market values as of the date of acquisition  july   and significantly increased the company s assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements as of december   as included elsewhere herein 
the purchase price of billion was financed through the issuance of common stock of billion to citigroup  issuances to the public of preferred stock of billion  common equity units of billion and debt securities of billion and the use of cash on hand of billion

the management s discussion and analysis which follows isolates  in order to be meaningful  the results of the travelers acquisition in the period over period comparison as the travelers acquisition was not included in the results of the company until july  the travelers amounts which have been isolated represent the results of the travelers legal entities which have been acquired 
these amounts represent the impact of the travelers acquisition  however  as business currently transacted through the acquired travelers legal entities is transitioned to legal entities already owned by the company  some of which has already occurred  the identification of the travelers legal entity business will not necessarily be indicative of the impact of the travelers acquisition on the results of the company 
as a part of the travelers acquisition  management realigned certain products and services within several of the company s segments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business 
accordingly  all prior period segment results have been adjusted to reflect such product reclassifications 
also in connection with the travelers acquisition  management has utilized its economic capital model to evaluate the deployment of capital based upon the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the company s existing and newly acquired businesses and has adjusted such allocations based upon this model 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  the acquisition of travelers contributed million to net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  excluding the impact of travelers  net income available to common shareholders increased by  million in the period 
the years ended december  and include the impact of certain transactions or events  the timing  nature and amount of which are generally unpredictable 
these transactions are described in each applicable segment s discussion below 
these items contributed a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the year ended december  and a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the comparable period 
excluding the impact of these items  net income available to common shareholders increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
in  the company sold its one madison avenue and park avenue properties in manhattan  new york  which  combined  resulted in a gain of  million  net of income taxes 
in addition  during  the company completed the sales of ssrm and metlife indonesia and recognized gains of million and million  respectively  both net of income taxes 
in  the company completed the sale of the sears tower property resulting in a gain of million  net of income taxes 
accordingly  income from discontinued operations and  correspondingly  net income  increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to the period primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in net investment losses of million  net of income taxes  for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in the acquisition of travelers contributed a loss of million  net of income taxes  to this decrease 
excluding the impact of travelers  net investment gains losses decreased by million  net of income taxes  in the period 
this decrease is primarily due to losses on fixed maturity security sales resulting from continued portfolio repositioning in the period 
significantly offsetting these reductions is an increase in gains from the mark to market on derivatives in the derivative gains resulted from changes in the value of the dollar versus major foreign currencies  including the euro and pound sterling  and changes in us interest rates during the year ended december  the increase in net income available to common shareholders during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is partially due to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders in the prior year of million  net of income taxes  as a result of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in recorded in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
in addition  during the second half of the year ended december   the company paid million in dividends on its series a and series b preferred shares issued in connection with financing the acquisition of travelers 
the remaining increase in net income available to common shareholders of million is primarily due to an increase in premiums  fees and other revenues primarily from continued sales growth across most of the company s business segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts 
the value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity performance 
in addition  continued strong investment spreads are largely due to higher than expected net investment income from corporate joint venture income and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
partially offsetting these increases is a rise in expenses primarily due to higher interest expense  integration costs  corporate incentive expenses  non deferrable volume related expenses  corporate support expenses and dac amortization 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  continued top line revenue growth across all of the company s business segments  strong interest rate spreads and an improvement in net investment gains losses are the leading contributors to the increase in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  over the comparable period 
total premiums  fees and other revenues increased to billion  up  from the year ended december   primarily from continued sales growth across most of the company s business segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts 
the value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity performance 
continued strong investment spreads are largely due to higher than expected net investment income from corporate joint venture income and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
in addition  an improvement in net investment gains losses  net of income taxes  of million is primarily due to the more favorable economic environment in these increases are partially offset by an million  net of income taxes  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in recorded in accordance with sop in comparison  in the period the company recorded a million charge for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement implementation issue no

industry trends the company s segments continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry 
financial environment 
the current financial environment presents a challenge for the life insurance industry 
a low general level of short term and long term interest rates can have a negative impact on the demand for and the profitability of spread based products such as fixed annuities  guaranteed interest contracts and universal life insurance 
in addition  continued low interest rates could put pressure on interest spreads on existing blocks of business as declining investment portfolio yields draw closer to minimum crediting rate guarantees on certain products 
the compression of the yields between spread based products and interest rates will be a concern until new money rates on corporate bonds are higher than overall life insurer investment portfolio yields 
recent volatile equity market performance has also presented challenges for life insurers  as fee revenue from variable annuities and pension products is tied to separate account balances  which reflect equity market performance 
also  variable annuity product demand often mirrors consumer demand for equity market investments 
improving economy 
a recovery in the employment market combined with higher corporate confidence should improve demand for group insurance and retirement savings type products 
group insurance premium growth  for example  with respect to life and disability products  are closely tied to employers total payroll growth 
additionally  the potential market for these products is expanded by new business creation 
bond portfolio credit losses have also benefited from an increasingly healthy economy 
demographics 
in the coming decade  a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will be the rising income protection  wealth accumulation  protection and transfer needs of the retiring baby boomers the first of whom have entered their pre retirement  peak savings years 
as a result of increasing longevity  retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span or more years 
helping the baby boomers accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently converting these assets into retirement income represents a transformative opportunity for the life insurance industry 
life insurers are well positioned to address the baby boomers rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for income protection 
in light of recent social security reform and pension solvency concerns  protection is what sets the us life insurance industry apart from other financial services providers pursuing the retiring baby boomer segment 
the company believes that  among life insurers  those with strong brands  high financial strength ratings  and broad distribution  are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection products to baby boomers 
moreover  the life insurance industry s products and the needs they are designed to address are complex 
the company believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek advice to plan for and manage their retirements and that  in the workplace  as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning  they will need individually tailored advice 
the challenge for the life insurance industry remains delivering tailored advice in a cost effective manner 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry is becoming increasingly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition  and sufficient scale  financial strength and flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
regulatory changes 
the life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulation recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and capital requirements for several of the industry s products 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products

the current period includes million of income from continuing operations related to the acquisition of travelers 
included in the travelers results is a charge for the establishment of an excess mortality reserve related to group of specific policies 
in connection with metlife s acquisition of travelers  the company has performed reviews of travelers underwriting criteria in its effort to refine its estimated fair values for the purchase price allocation 
as a result of these reviews and actuarial analyses  and to be consistent with metlife s existing reserving methodologies  the company has established an excess mortality reserve on a specific group of policies 
this resulted in a charge of million  net of income taxes  to fourth quarter results 
the company expects to complete its reviews and refine its estimate of the excess mortality reserve by june  excluding the acquisition of travelers  income from continuing operations increased by million  or 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december  and includes the impact of certain transactions or events  the timing  nature and amount of which are generally unpredictable 
these transactions are described in each applicable segment s discussion below 
these items contributed a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the year ended december  and a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the comparable period 
excluding the impact of these items  income from continuing operations increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
the individual segment contributed million  net of income taxes  to the increase  as a result of interest rate spreads  increased fee income related to the growth in separate account products  favorable underwriting  a decrease in the closed block related policyholder dividend obligation  lower annuity net guaranteed benefit costs and lower dac amortization

liquidity uses insurance liabilities 
the company s principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities associated with its various life insurance  property and casualty  annuity and group pension products  operating expenses and income taxes  as well as principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations

the determination of these liability amounts and the timing of payment are not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event or payment triggering event has not yet occurred 
such excluded liabilities primarily represent future policy benefits of approximately billion relating to traditional life  health and disability insurance products and policyholder account balances of approximately billion relating to deferred annuities  billion for group and universal life products and approximately billion for funding agreements without fixed maturity dates 
significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns  inflation and the timing of payments

the amount shown in the more than five years column represents the sum of cash flows  also adjusted for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement and other appropriate factors and undiscounted with respect to interest  extending for more than years from the present date 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements at december  the liability amount in the consolidated financial statements reflects the discounting for interest  as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
amounts differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts above do not include any fair value adjustments  related premiums and discounts or capital leases which are presented separately 
amounts include interest to be paid on fixed rate debt only

further  state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations 
it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere herein in connection with specific matters 
in some of the matters referred to herein  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
other 
based on management s analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities  the dividends it receives from subsidiaries  including metropolitan life  that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the company to make payments on debt  make cash dividend payments on its common stock  pay all operating expenses  and meet its cash needs 
the nature of the company s diverse product portfolio and customer base lessens the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity

the common and preferred securities of the trusts  totaling  million  represent undivided beneficial ownership interests in the assets of the trusts  have no stated maturity and must be redeemed upon maturity of the corresponding series of junior subordinated debt securities the sole assets of the respective trusts 
the series a and series b trusts will make quarterly distributions on the common and preferred securities at an annual rate of and  respectively 
the holding company has directly guaranteed the repayment of the trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent that there are funds available in the trusts 
the guarantee will remain in place until the full redemption of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities held by the common equity unit holders are pledged to the holding company to collateralize the obligation of the common equity unit holders under the related stock purchase contracts 
the common equity unit holder may substitute certain zero coupon treasury securities in place of the trust preferred securities as collateral under the stock purchase contract 
the trust preferred securities have remarketing dates which correspond with the initial and subsequent stock purchase dates to provide the holders of the common equity units with the proceeds to exercise the stock purchase contracts 
the initial stock purchase date is expected to be august   but could be deferred for quarterly periods until february   and the subsequent stock purchase date is expected to be february   but could be deferred for quarterly periods until february  at the remarketing date  the remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the interest rate on the trust preferred securities to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the common equity unit holder s obligation under the stock purchase contract  subject to a reset cap for each of the first two attempted remarketings of each series 
the interest rate on the supporting junior subordinated debt securities issued by the holding company will be reset at a commensurate rate 
if the initial remarketing is unsuccessful  the remarketing agent will attempt to remarket the trust preferred securities  as necessary  in subsequent quarters through february  for the series a trust preferred securities and through february  for the series b trust preferred securities 
the final attempt at remarketing will not be subject to the reset cap 
if all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful  the holding company has the right  as a secured party  to apply the liquidation amount on the trust preferred securities to the common equity unit holders obligation under the stock purchase contract and to deliver to the common equity unit holder a junior subordinated debt security payable on august  at an annual rate of and on the series a and series b trust preferred securities  respectively  in payment of any accrued and unpaid distributions 
each stock purchase contract requires i the holding company to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly contract payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual rate of on the stated amount of per stock purchase contract until the initial stock purchase date and at the annual rate of on the remaining stated amount of per stock purchase contract thereafter  and ii the holder of the common equity unit to purchase  and the holding company to sell  for  on each of the initial stock purchase date and the subsequent stock purchase date  a number of newly issued or treasury shares of the holding company s common stock  par value per share  equal to the applicable settlement rate 
the settlement rate at the respective stock purchase date will be calculated based on the closing price of the common stock during a specified day period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date 
accordingly  upon settlement in the aggregate  the holding company will receive proceeds of  million and issue between million and million shares of common stock 
the stock purchase contract may be exercised at the option of the holder at any time prior to the settlement date 
however  upon early settlement  the holder will receive the minimum settlement rate

guarantees in the course of its business  the company has provided certain indemnities  guarantees and commitments to third parties pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in the future 
in the context of acquisition  disposition  investment and other transactions  the company has provided indemnities and guarantees  including those related to tax  environmental and other specific liabilities  and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by the company 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing  as well as for certain other liabilities  such as third party lawsuits 
these obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration  including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law  such as applicable statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than million to billion  with a cumulative maximum of billion  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees in the future 
in addition  the company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by laws 
also  the company indemnifies other of its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the company s interests 
since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these indemnities in the future 
the company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on certain international retirement funds in accordance with local laws 
since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees in the future 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a liability of million with respect to indemnities provided in connection with a certain disposition 
the approximate term for this liability is months 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to pay under these indemnities is approximately million 
due to the uncertainty in assessing changes to the liability over the term  the liability on the company s consolidated balance sheet will remain until either expiration or settlement of the guarantee unless evidence clearly indicates that the estimates should be revised 
in the third quarter of  the company released million of a liability due to the expiration of indemnities provided in a prior year disposition 
the company s recorded liabilities at december  and for indemnities  guarantees and commitments were million and million  respectively 
in connection with rsats  the company writes credit default swap obligations requiring payment of principal due in exchange for the reference credit obligation  depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit events for the referenced entities 
in the event of a specified credit event  the company s maximum amount at risk  assuming the value of the referenced credits becomes worthless  is million at december  the credit default swaps expire at various times during the next six years 
other commitments tic is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb of boston and has entered into several funding agreements with the fhlb of boston whereby tic has issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and for which the fhlb of boston has been granted a blanket lien on tic s residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities to collateralize tic s obligations under the funding agreements 
tic maintains control over these pledged assets  and may use  commingle  encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level 
the funding agreements and the related security agreement represented by this blanket lien  provide that upon any event of default by tic  the fhlb of boston s recovery is limited to the amount of tic s liability under the outstanding funding agreements 
the amount of the company s liability for funding agreements with the bank as of december  is billion  which is included in policyholder account balances 
collateral for securities lending the company has noncash collateral for securities lending on deposits from customers  which cannot be sold or re pledged  and which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets

pensions and postretirement benefit plans description of plans plan description overview subsidiaries of the company the subsidiaries sponsor and or administer various qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans and postretirement employee benefit plans covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified eligibility requirements 
virtually all of the subsidiaries obligations under the defined benefit pension plans relate to traditional defined benefit obligations 
effective january   the basic plan benefit under the traditional defined benefit pension plan was amended to provide an annual benefit based upon a participant s final five year average earnings and credited years of service integrated with social security benefits 
effective january  the pension plan was amended to incorporate a new benefit formula for employees hired on or after january  and those existing employees who elected to have new accruals after december  determined under the new formula 
under the new benefit formula  amounts are credited to individual participants hypothetical accounts 
such plan accumulations are commonly referred to as cash balance plans 
eligible participants accounts are credited monthly for benefits equal to five percent of eligible monthly pay  and an additional five percent on the excess eligible monthly pay over the current social security wage base 
participants are also credited interest each month based on the average annual rate of interest on year us treasury securities as published by the irs in november of the prior year 
postretirement benefits consist primarily of healthcare and life insurance benefits 
employees of the subsidiaries who were hired prior to or  in certain cases  rehired during or after and meet age and service criteria while working for a covered subsidiary  may become eligible for these postretirement benefits  at various levels  in accordance with the applicable plans 
employees hired after are not eligible for postretirement benefits 
financial summary a summary of the plan obligations and plan assets for the pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years ended december  and are presented below 
a december measurement date is used for all the subsidiaries defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
as described more fully in the discussion of plan assets which follows  the subsidiaries have issued group annuity and life insurance contracts supporting of all pension and postretirement benefit plan assets 
the benefit obligations and funded status of the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows december  postretirement pension benefits benefits in millions projected benefit obligation at end of year     fair value of plan assets at end of year     underfunded  unrecognized net asset at transition unrecognized net actuarial losses   unrecognized prior service cost prepaid accrued benefit cost   qualified plan prepaid pension cost   non qualified plan accrued pension cost intangible assets accumulated other comprehensive loss prepaid accrued benefit cost   the prepaid accrued benefit cost for pension benefits presented in the above table consists of prepaid benefit costs of  million and  million as of december  and  respectively  and accrued benefit costs of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for the pension plans were as follows non qualified qualified plan plan total in millions aggregate fair value of plan assets principally company contracts     aggregate projected benefit obligation     over under funded the accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was  million and  million at december  and  respectively

 employers accounting for pensions sfas establishes the accounting for pension plan obligations 
under sfas  the projected pension benefit obligation pbo is defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary levels 
the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo is the actuarial present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary levels 
the pbo and abo of the pension plans are set forth in the preceding section 
obligations  both pbo and abo  of the defined benefit pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  from which actual results may vary 
some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the expected rate of compensation increases and average expected retirement age 
assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as follows december  weighted average discount rate rate of compensation increase average expected retirement age the discount rate is determined annually based on the yield  measured on a yield to worst basis  of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the valuation date  which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate projected pension benefit obligation when due 
the yield of this hypothetical portfolio  constructed of bonds rated aa or better by moody s resulted in a discount rate of approximately and for the defined pension plans as of december  and  respectively 
a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the pension benefit obligation 
this increase is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain 
based on the december  pbo  a basis point decrease increase in the discount rate would result in an increase decrease in the pbo of approximately million 
changes in discount rates are amortized into earnings as actuarial gains and losses 
at the end of  total unrecognized actuarial losses were  million  as compared to  million in the majority of the unrecognized actuarial losses are due to declining discount rates in recent years 
these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the pension plans 
as the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are calculated as a percentage of future earnings  an assumption of future compensation increases is required to determine the projected benefit obligation 
these rates are derived through periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted by an independent actuarial firm 
the last review of such data was conducted using salary information through and the subsidiaries believe that no circumstances have since occurred that would result in a material change to these rates 
sfas also requires the recognition of an additional minimum liability and an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost if the market value of pension plan assets is less than the abo at the measurement date 
the subsidiaries additional minimum liability was million  and the intangible asset was million  at december  the excess of the additional minimum liability over the intangible asset  of million is recorded  net of income taxes  as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income 
postretirement benefit plan obligations sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  establishes the accounting for expected postretirement plan benefit obligations epbo which represents the actuarial present value of all postretirement benefits expected to be paid after retirement to employees and their dependents 
unlike for pensions  the epbo is not recorded in the financial statements but is used in measuring the periodic expense 
the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligations apbo represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a particular date 
the apbo is recorded in the financial statements 
the apbo is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  from which actual results may vary 
some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate  the health care cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age 
the determination of the discount rate and the average expected retirement age are substantially consistent with the determination described previously under the pension plan 
the assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation were as follows december  pre medicare eligible claims down to in down to in medicare eligible claims down to in down to in assumed health care cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects one percent one percent increase decrease in millions effect on total of service and interest cost components effect of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
this increase is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain 
based on the december  apbo  a basis point decrease increase in the discount rate would result in an increase decrease in the apbo of approximately million 
changes in discount rates are amortized into earnings as actuarial gains and losses 
at the end of  total unrecognized actuarial losses were million  as compared to million in the majority of the unrecognized actuarial losses are due to declining discount rates  an increase in expected health care inflation and changes in demographic assumptions 
these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the postretirement benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the postretirement benefit plans 
the company expects to receive subsidies on prescription drug benefits beginning in under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the prescription drug act 
the other postretirement benefit plan accumulated benefit obligation was remeasured effective july  in order to determine the effect of the expected subsidies on net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
as a result  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by million at july  and net periodic postretirement benefit cost from july  through december  was reduced by million 
the reduction of net periodic benefit cost was due to reductions in service cost of million  interest cost of million  and amortization of prior actuarial loss of million 
the reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to the prescription drug act was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the reduction of net periodic postretirement benefit cost was million  which was due to reductions in service cost of million  interest cost of million and amortization of prior actuarial loss of million 
an additional million reduction in the december  accumulated postretirement benefit plan obligation is the result of an acturial loss recognized during the year resulting from updated assumptions including a january  participant census and new claims cost experience and the effect of a december  change in the discount rate 
pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost pension cost net periodic pension cost is comprised of the following service cost service cost is the increase in the projected pension benefit obligation resulting from benefits payable to employees of the subsidiaries on service rendered during the current year 
interest cost on the liability interest cost is the time value adjustment on the projected pension benefit obligation at the end of each year 
expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated pension fund assets in a particular year 
amortization of unrecognized prior service cost this cost relates to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation of new plans 
as the economic benefits of these costs are realized in the future periods these costs are amortized to pension expense over the expected service years of the employees 
amortization of actuarial loss the amortization of actuarial loss comprises of differences between the actual experience and the expected experience on pension plan assets or projected benefit obligation at the end of each year and the amortization of the unrecognized net gain or loss from prior periods 
the subsidiaries recognized pension expense of million in as compared to million in and million in the major components of net periodic pension cost described above are as follows pension benefits in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior actuarial losses amortization of prior service cost curtailment cost net periodic benefit cost the increase in expense was primarily a result of both increase in service cost and amortization of actuarial losses resulting largely from a declining discount rate  partially offset by the impact of an increase in the expected rates of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net periodic pension cost was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected rate of return on pension plan assets used to calculate the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which the plan invests  weighted by target allocation percentages 
anticipated future performance is based on long term historical returns of the plan assets by sector  adjusted for the subsidiaries long term expectations on the performance of the markets 
while the precise expected return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to year  the subsidiaries policy is to hold this long term assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate 
the actual net return on the investments has been an approximation of the estimated return for the pension plan in  and due to anticipated changes in asset allocations  the expected rate of return will be lowered to for purposes of determining net periodic pension benefit cost 
based on the december  asset balances  a basis point increase decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost of approximately million for the pension plans 
postretirement benefit cost the net periodic postretirement benefit cost benefit consists of the following service cost service cost is the increase in the projected postretirement benefit obligation resulting from benefits payable to employees of the subsidiaries on service rendered during the current year 
interest cost on the liability interest cost is the time value adjustment on the projected postretirement benefit obligation at the end of each year 
expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated postretirement fund assets in a particular year

as the economic benefits of these costs are realized in the future periods these costs are amortized to postretirement benefit expense over the expected service years of the employees 
amortization of actuarial loss the amortization of actuarial loss comprises of differences between the actual experience and the expected experience on postretirement benefit plan assets or expected postretirement plan benefit obligation at the end of each year and the amortization of the unrecognized net gain or loss from prior periods 
the subsidiaries recognized postretirement benefit expense of million in as compared to million in and million in the major components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost described above are as follows postretirement benefits in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior actuarial losses amortization of prior service cost curtailment cost net periodic benefit cost the increase in expense was primarily a result of both increase in service cost and amortization of actuarial losses resulting largely from a declining discount rate  partially offset by the impact of an increase in the expected rates of return on plan assets

the actual net return on the investments has been an approximation of the estimated return for the postretirement plans in  and due to anticipated changes in asset allocations  the expected rate of return will be lowered to for healthcare benefits and is estimated to remain the same at for life benefits 
based on the december  asset balances  a basis point increase decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost of approximately million for the postretirement plans 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assets pension plan assets assets of the pension plans are invested within group annuity and life insurance contracts issued by the subsidiaries 
the majority of assets are held in separate accounts established by the subsidiaries 
the account values of assets held with the subsidiaries were  million and  million as of december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its corporate risk management department  asset liability management committees alm committees and additional specialists at the business segment level 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
the company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate  equity market and foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of that analysis  the company has determined that the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  equity market  and foreign currency exchange risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
the travelers acquisition has increased the company s exposure to market risk 
the travelers acquisition has not changed management s processes for measuring  managing and monitoring market risk  however  some of those processes are utilizing interim manual reporting and estimation techniques while the company integrates the operations acquired 
during the second half of  management restructured the portfolio of assets that were acquired  generally reducing the amount of market risk associated with the acquired block  in line with the company s overall investment strategy 
the acquisition also changed the profile of the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk  although management still deems the aggregate sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk to be immaterial 
market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include guaranteed interest contracts and fixed annuities  which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term treasury rates as the fixed maturities 
the company employs product design  pricing and asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products 
asset liability management strategies include the use of derivatives  the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments  and prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the company s products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support 
equity market prices 
the company s investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices  as do certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance 
it manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset liability management strategies 
the company also manages equity market price risk through industry and issuer diversification  asset allocation techniques and the use of derivatives 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity securities  equity securities and liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the company mitigates the majority of its fixed maturities foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company is primarily exposed to the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  the australian dollar  the argentinean peso  the south korean won  the chilean peso  the taiwanese dollar and the japanese yen 
the company has matched substantially all of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to currency exchange rate fluctuation 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
additionally  in some countries  local surplus is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk 
risk management corporate risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve asset liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
metlife also has a separate corporate risk management department  which is responsible for risk throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief financial officer 
the corporate risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the governance committee of the holding company s board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
the company actively manages its assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income taxes  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the asset liability management process is the shared responsibility of the portfolio management unit  the business finance asset liability management unit  and the operating business segments under the supervision of the various product line specific alm committees 
the alm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios on a periodic basis  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the asset liability management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists  who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities  implement the goals and objectives established by the alm committees 
each of metlife s business segments has an asset liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment  product pricing  hedge strategy and liability management issues 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies include objectives for effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
to manage interest rate risk  the company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
new york state department of insurance regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each operating asset segment has a duration constraint based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments or curve mismatch strategies 
hedging activities 
to reduce interest rate risk  metlife s risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities 
such instruments include financial futures  financial forwards  interest rate and credit default swaps  caps  floors and options 
metlife also uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments 
in  metlife initiated a hedging strategy for certain equity price risks within its liabilities using equity futures and options 
risk measurement  sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts  based on changes in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its trading and non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets  earnings and cash flows as follows fair values 
the company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change increase or decrease in the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices  and the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates 
earnings and cash flows 
metlife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate change increase or decrease in interest rates and equity prices 
the following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities  the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities  the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each change increase or decrease in the interest rates  and the expected turnover sales of fixed maturities and equity securities  including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset liability management personnel 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  in addition  the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the company s equity price sensitive positions at december  is set forth in the table below 
the potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s portfolio  as of the period indicated was december  in millions non trading interest rate risk  equity price risk foreign currency exchange rate risk trading interest rate risk the table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in fair value of the company s non trading interest sensitive financial instruments at december  by type of asset or liability 
as of december  assuming a increase notional in the yield amount fair value curve 
in millions assets fixed maturities   equity securities  mortgage and consumer loans  policy loans  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents  mortgage loan commitments total assets  as of december  assuming a increase notional in the yield amount fair value curve 
in millions liabilities policyholder account balances  short term debt  long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities underlying common equity units  shares subject to mandatory redemption payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions  total liabilities  other derivative instruments designated hedges or otherwise interest rate swaps  interest rate floors  interest rate caps  financial futures  foreign currency swaps  foreign currency forwards  options financial forwards  credit default swaps  synthetic gics  other total other net change  this quantitative measure of risk has increased by  million  or  at december   from  million at december  the primary reasons for the increase are growth in assets exposed to interest rate risk in increasing interest scenarios including fixed maturity instruments and interest rate floors  and the increase in the yield curve since december  subsequent to the restructuring of assets to comply with metlife s investment guidelines  the travelers acquisition represents million of the increase 
approximately million of the increase is due to asset growth other than from the travelers acquisition and approximately million is due to the lengthening of the asset portfolio during the major contributor to the remainder of the change is movements in the yield curve 
in addition to the analysis above  as part of its asset liability management program  the company also performs an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates  including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments 
as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates applied to the company s liabilities  insurance and associated asset portfolios would reduce the fair value of equity by million 
management does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity strain on the company
