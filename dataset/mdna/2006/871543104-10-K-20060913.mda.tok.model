our products play an essential role in network operations  bandwidth optimization  and quality of service of wireline  wireless and broadband communications networks  enabling our customers to increase performance and efficiency in their communications infrastructures 
symmetricom s customers include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  public telephone and telegraph companies ptts  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  other telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable television operators  distributors and systems integrators and communications original equipment manufacturers oems 
with the fiscal acquisition of truetime and datum  we broadened our customer base to include aerospace contractors  governments and research facilities 
on april   we announced plans for the closure of the contract manufacturing work conducted at our puerto rico facility 
symmetricom s telecom solution division revenues contain a specialty manufacturing other segment that is related to this contract manufacturing work 
we anticipate exiting this non core business during fiscal and reallocating the majority of the related manufacturing resources to other activities 
revenues for this segment were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
on august   we acquired agilent technologies frequency and timing standards product line 
including the a cesium primary frequency standard 
this acquisition has enhanced symmetricom s position in the area of cesium standards and symmetricom s leadership in generating high precision frequency and timing references including rubidium  cesium and hydrogen masers 
we acquired certain assets of agilent technologies for a cost of approximately million which was accounted for as a purchase 
in june  we discontinued the operation of the trusted time division and integrated the broadband network division into the telecom solutions division 
the trusted time division was acquired as part of the acquisition of datum in october the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
certain charges related to the discontinuance of this operation  including a non cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles associated with this business  were taken in fiscal on october   we completed our acquisition of datum 
each share of datum common stock outstanding was converted into the right to receive shares of symmetricom common stock 
the aggregate consideration was approximately million shares of our common stock 
the acquisition of datum qualified as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of section a of internal revenue code and was accounted for as a purchase 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventories  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  excess and obsolete inventory  future warranty costs  stock options  and valuation of deferred tax assets  income taxes  and stock options 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for warranty  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of investments and valuation of intangible assets and goodwill to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue from sales of product and software licenses is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue from post sale customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
we assess collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an amount of revenue equal to our estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense when orders are shipped  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the income from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand  and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
during fiscal  and  we charged million  million and million  respectively to cost of goods sold to write down excess and obsolete inventory 
accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
we operate a subsidiary in puerto rico under a grant providing for partial exemption from puerto rico taxes through fiscal in addition  this subsidiary was taxed under section of the us internal revenue code  which exempted qualified puerto rico source earnings  subject to various limitations  from regular federal income taxes through fiscal taxes have been calculated on this subsidiary s earnings  all of which we intend to remit to the us section expired as of the end of fiscal in july  the puerto rico subsidiary  formerly enjoying the benefits of section  moved its place of legal organization from delaware to bermuda in a tax free reorganization 
consistent with a resolution by the symmetricom  inc board of directors  this subsidiary has elected to indefinitely reinvest its future earnings outside the united states 
under the applicable accounting rules  future earnings of this subsidiary will not be subject to us taxes  as its future earnings will not be repatriated back to symmetricom  inc we estimate that the fiscal effective tax rate will be approximately  based on management s estimate of pretax income and the split of income between us and foreign jurisdictions 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and has a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
valuation of investments we did not carry any investments in public or private companies during fiscal and during fiscal  we concluded that the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of sarantel ltd  a privately held company  was other than temporary 
we recorded million as a loss on equity investment 
on march   sarantel went public in the united kingdom and began trading on the aim market of the london stock exchange under the symbol slg 
subsequently  the company sold the stock of sarantel ltd 
and recorded a gain of million on the investment in june valuation of goodwill in the third quarter of the fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of the goodwill entirely related to our wireless oem business segment purchased in connection with the datum acquisition in october we perform goodwill impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to perform a goodwill impairment test on the wireless oem business segment since the product pricing pressures and gross margin pressures discussed in prior quarters continued to decline in the third quarter of fiscal and we did not anticipate any improvement 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount using discounted cash flow valuation method  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in fiscal and  no impairment losses were recorded based on these evaluations 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
we review our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the third quarter of the fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of the other intangibles entirely related to our wireless business segment purchase in connection with the datum acquisition in october in fiscal and  no impairment losses were recorded based on this evaluation

these metrics  which compare fiscal with fiscal  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of june  our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of june   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of june   we have approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
headcount our consolidated headcount as of june  was comprised of regular employees and temporary employees  compared to regular employees and temporary employees as of june  deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of deferred revenue on sales of goods with special terms  which are recognized when the special terms are satisfied  maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  and distributor return allowances  which are based on historical return averages with certain distributors 
deferred revenue for sales of goods with special terms was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for maintenance contracts was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for distributor return allowances was million as of june   compared to million as of june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million compared to million as of june  cash and cash equivalents as of june  decreased million to million from million as of june  this decrease was primarily the result of million in cash used for investing activities  and million in cash used for financing activities  offset by million in cash provided by operating activities 
short term investments increased from million as of june  to million as of june  this increase resulted primarily from the fact that we invested more in short term investments during fiscal the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net profit of million and non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of million  impairment of goodwill and intangibles of million  and stock based compensation of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million increase in inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal and the increase in inventory was the result of discontinuing the contract manufacturing works for our telecom solution division in puerto rico manufacturing 
the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in purchases of short term investments  million in purchases of plant and equipment  and million cash payment for the acquisition of the agilent product line  which was partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments 
the million net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which was offset by million repurchase of common stock and million for repayment of long term obligation 
our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of june  were million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   an increase from days as of june   which is attributable to a larger amount of shipments made in the last month of the prior quarter  resulting in lower collections in the last quarter of fiscal we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments in corporate debt securities have maturity dates of greater than three months 
our corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than nine months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
in addition  we believe that we currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
on june   we issued convertible subordinate notes with a fixed rate of  which would have no interest rate risk impact to our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business with various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
based on the intercompany balances of million with the united kingdom and million with germany at june   a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such intercompany balances  or of other accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
