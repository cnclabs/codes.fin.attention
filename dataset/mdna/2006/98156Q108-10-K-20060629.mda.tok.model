better worse depreciation and amortization better worse investment income the decrease in investment income relates to realized losses recognized with the sale of certain investments during fiscal better worse interest expense better worse other income  net provision effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance no longer necessary upon the assignment of the lease of the world to a third party and other state tax benefits

the transaction subsequently closed during the third quarter of fiscal income from discontinued operations related to xfl was million for fiscal year the results from fiscal reflected our final settlement of substantially all xfl remaining liabilities at less than the originally projected amount 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal years ended april   and were  million and million  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal is due in part to the million reduction in the amount spent on feature film production projects

we currently have completed two film projects and are in the principal photography stage of production for our third film 
as of april   we have approximately million in capitalized film production assets 
the aggregate gross production budget for the film currently in production  the condemned  is estimated to be approximately million  with the majority of this expenditure occurring in the eight months ending december cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a million increase in accrued expense and other liabilities 
accrued income taxes were million as of april  increasing from zero at april  as we were in a prepaid tax position at that time

this transaction did not affect other aspects of our business relationship with viacom 
we made this repurchase because we believed that it was an appropriate use of excess cash and was beneficial to the company and our stockholders 
we believe that cash generated from operations and from existing cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs over the next twelve months for working capital  capital expenditures  feature film production and the payment of dividends 
contractual obligations in addition to long term debt  we have entered into various other contracts under which we are required to make guaranteed payments  including various operating leases for office space and equipment 
employment contract with vincent k 
mcmahon  which runs through october  with annual renewals thereafter if not terminated by us or mr 
mcmahon  as well as a talent contract with mr

our aggregate minimum payment obligations under these contracts as of april   assuming the continued waiver of compensation by mr 
and mrs 
mcmahon  were as follows payments due by period in millions months ending to to after total long term debt operating leases talent  employment agreements and other commitments total commitments seasonality our operating results are not materially affected by seasonal factors  however  our premier event  wrestlemania  occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter  which as a result is historically our strongest quarter 
due to our change in fiscal year end  beginning in calendar year wrestlemania will occur in our second quarter 
in addition  revenues from our licensing and direct sale of consumer products  including our catalogs  magazines and internet sites  may vary from period to period depending on the volume and extent of licensing agreements and marketing and promotion programs entered into during any particular period of time  as well as the commercial success of the media exposure of our characters and brand 
the timing of these events as well as the continued introduction of new product offerings and revenue generating outlets can and will cause fluctuation in quarterly revenues and earnings 
inflation during the past three fiscal years  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
application of critical accounting policies accounting policies we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  as well as the significant judgments and estimates affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition pay per view programming revenues from our pay per view programming are recorded when the event is aired and are based upon our initial estimate of the number of buys achieved 
this initial estimate is based on preliminary buy information received from our pay per view distributors 
final reconciliation of the pay per view buys occurs within one year and any subsequent adjustments to the buys are recognized on a cash basis 
as of april   our pay per view accounts receivable was million 
if our initial estimate is incorrect  it can result in significant adjustments to revenues in subsequent years 
television advertising revenues from the sale of television advertising in canada are recorded when the commercial airs within our programming and are based upon contractual amounts previously established with our advertisers 
these contractual amounts are typically based on the advertisement reaching a desired number of viewers 
if an ad does not reach the desired number of viewers  we record an estimated reserve to reflect rebates or additional ad placements due to advertisers  based on the difference between the intended delivery as contracted and actual delivery of audiences 
as of april   our estimated reserve was million 
if our estimated reserves are incorrect  revenues in subsequent periods would be impacted 
sponsorships through our sponsorship packages  we offer advertisers a full range of our promotional vehicles  including internet and print advertising  arena signage and special appearances by our superstars 
we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and assign the total sponsorship revenues to the various elements contained within a sponsorship package based on their relative fair value 
our relative fair values for the sponsorship elements are based upon a combination of historical prices and current advertising market conditions 
revenue from these packages is recognized as each element is delivered 
if we do not accurately estimate the fair values of the various components of sponsorship packages  the timing of our income recognition would be impacted 
sponsorship revenues totaled million in fiscal home video revenues from the sales of home video titles are recorded when shipped by our distributor to wholesalers retailers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
the allowance for estimated returns is based on historical information and current industry trends 
as of april   our home video returns allowance was million 
if we do not accurately predict returns  we may have to adjust revenues in future periods 
magazine publishing publishing newsstand revenues are recorded when shipped by our distributor to wholesalers retailers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
we estimate the allowance for newsstand returns based upon our review of historical return rates and the expected performance of our current titles in relation to prior issue return rates 
as of april   our newsstand returns allowance was million 
if we do not accurately predict returns  we may have to adjust revenues in future periods 
feature films we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including production overhead  as feature film production assets 
these costs will be amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized film costs or estimated fair value 
these costs for an individual film will be amortized and participation and residual costs will be accrued in the proportion that the current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
management regularly reviews and revises  when necessary  its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film to its estimated fair value 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue and cost estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
as of april   we have approximately million in capitalized film production costs 
we have performed an initial estimate of our ultimate revenue for our two completed projects  see no evil and the marine  and believe no write down is required at this time 
allowance for doubtful accounts our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that we estimate to be uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding and the financial condition of individual customers 
changes in the financial condition of significant customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional allowances that may be required 
as of april  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  we recognize the future impact of the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april   we have million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when management does not believe the future tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
we also provide reserves when we believe that it is not probable that a tax position taken by the company will be sustained if challenged 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity compensates employee services through share based payments 
this statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates of sfas no 
r to require the implementation no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company plans to adopt this statement on may  we do not currently expect the impact of this pronouncement to be material to our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate  interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange rate risk is minimized by maintaining minimal net assets and liabilities in currencies other than our functional currency 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolio 
our debt consists of the mortgage related to our corporate headquarters  which has an annual interest rate of 
the fair value of this debt is not significantly different from its carrying amount 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income mutual funds and united states treasury notes  with a strong emphasis placed on preservation of capital 
in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  our investment portfolio s dollar weighted duration is less than one year 
due to the nature of our investments and our strategy to minimize market and interest rate risk  we believe that our portfolio would not be materially impacted by adverse fluctuations in interest rates
