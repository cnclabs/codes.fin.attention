see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 
suppliers pharmaceutical distribution and provider services the company obtains its products from many different suppliers  the largest of which  pfizer inc  accounted for approximately by dollar volume of the company s revenue in fiscal the company s five largest suppliers accounted on a combined basis for approximately by dollar volume of the company s revenue during fiscal overall  the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good 
the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable rates 
the company s pharmaceutical distribution business began a business model transition in fiscal regarding the manner in which it was compensated for the services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
historically  pharmaceutical distribution was compensated by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of price inflation 
specifically  a significant portion of the compensation pharmaceutical distribution received from such manufacturers was derived from the company s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of price increases  hold that inventory as manufacturers increased prices  and generate a higher gross margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 
beginning in fiscal  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers sought additional services from the company  including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
these changes significantly reduced the compensation as a percentage of revenue received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in response to these developments  the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers pricing practices  and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
this transition was completed during fiscal these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers price increases 
under the fee for service arrangements  reflected in written distribution service agreements  the company s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus an inflation based compensation component 
in certain instances  the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement 
the fee is typically a fixed percentage of the company s purchases or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to customers 
apart from its fee for service arrangements reflected in distribution service agreements  the company also continues to be compensated by some branded manufacturers based solely on price inflation 
if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents the distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one year term with an automatic renewal feature to a five year term 
these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed to by the parties  a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured  or in the event of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate without cause within a defined notice period 
medical products and services  pharmaceutical technology and services and clinical technologies and services the medical products and services and pharmaceutical technologies and services segments use a broad range of raw materials  compounds and purchased components in the products they manufacture  including latex  resins  gelatin and pharmaceutical ingredients  among others 
the clinical technologies and services segment uses purchased components in the products that it manufactures  including custom designed components and assemblies 
in certain circumstances  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by cost increases because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements 
in addition  although most of these raw materials or components are generally available  certain raw materials or components used by the company s manufacturing businesses may be available only from a limited number of suppliers 
there also may be cases where a particular raw material may be available from another supplier or several other suppliers  but the company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements  regulatory filings or product approvals 
in either case  where there are a limited number of suppliers  the company may experience shortages in supply  and as a result  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s medical products and services segment  at times  purchases medical surgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products 
certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer 
if this practice becomes more widespread  the ability of the medical products and services segment to purchase products from other distributors  as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors  may be impaired 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
competition the company operates in markets that are highly competitive 
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment  the company s pharmaceutical distribution business competes directly with two other national wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors and third party logistics companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes pricing  breadth of product lines  service offerings and support services 
the pharmaceutical distribution business has narrow profit margins and  accordingly  the company s earnings depend significantly on its ability to compete effectively on the pricing of pharmaceutical products  distribute a large volume and variety of products efficiently  provide quality support services  enter into and maintain satisfactory arrangements with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers so it is compensated for the services it provides manufacturers  and 
table of contents effectively manage inventory and other working capital items 
with respect to pharmacy franchising operations  a few smaller franchisors compete with medicine shoppe and medicap in the franchising of pharmacies  with competition being based primarily upon financial assistance offered to qualified franchisees  aggregation of purchase volume  operational support and assistance  benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the customer  access to third party programs  brand awareness and marketing support and pricing 
medicine shoppe and medicap also need to be competitive with a pharmacist s ongoing options to operate an independent pharmacy or work for a chain pharmacy

inventories in connection with the business model transition discussed under suppliers above  the pharmaceutical distribution business days of inventory on hand are significantly lower than historical levels as a result of reduced investment buying opportunities and lower inventory levels negotiated with pharmaceutical manufacturers

competitive pressures could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company operates in markets that are highly competitive 
for example  the company s pharmaceutical distribution business competes with two national wholesale distributors  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors and third party logistics companies 
competitive pressures could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the company s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in recent years  a significant portion of the company s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers 
the company s largest customers  cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately 
table of contents and  respectively  of the company s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal the aggregate of the company s five largest customers  including cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately of the company s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal in addition  cvs and walgreens accounted for and  respectively  of the company gross trade receivable balance at june  as a result  the company s sales and credit concentration is significant 
any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  certain of the company s businesses have entered into agreements with gpos 
approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation and premier 
generally  compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary 
still  the loss of an agreement with a gpo could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition because the company could lose customers or have to reduce prices as a result 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and the company expects the industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services  legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information  or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the company s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for the company s products and services 
changes in the healthcare industry s pricing  selling  inventory  distribution or supply policies or practices  or changes in the company s customer mix  could also significantly reduce the company s revenue and results of operations 
healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents 
a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of generic drugs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government  including state departments of health  state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies  to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit  adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 
certain states  such as florida  have already adopted laws and regulations  including pedigree tracking requirements  that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system 
regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act  which will be effective december   will also require the passage of pedigree information in defined circumstances 
other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the company s pharmaceutical distribution business  and could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
new federal legislation was enacted on february  that  among other things  changes the prescription drug reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements for generic pharmaceuticals under medicaid to reduce costs for that program 
under this new legislation  the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in various administrative agencies are in the process of defining the specific details of the legislation 
the company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process 
the company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes 
if the company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans  this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of this new legislation could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s medical products and services segment  at times  purchases medical surgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products 
certain manufacturers 
table of contents have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer 
if this practice becomes more widespread  the ability of the medical products and services segment to purchase products from other distributors  as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors  may be impaired 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s pharmaceutical distribution business is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices  which subjects the company to risks and uncertainties 
as part of the pharmaceutical distribution business s transition to fee for service terms  some distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation based compensation component to them 
arrangements with other branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflation based 
if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  the pharmaceutical distribution business distributes generic pharmaceuticals  which are subject to price deflation 
if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

the company accordingly recorded a reserve of million in the fiscal year ended june  in addition to the million reserve recorded during the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to resolve the sec s investigation with respect to the company will be successful  or that the amount reserved will be sufficient  and the company cannot predict the timing or the final terms of any settlement 
the company is subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows

insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to pharmaceutical companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits  require larger self insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products 
there can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the company s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and  as such  these claims could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition

in connection with these conclusions  the audit committee determined that the consolidated financial statements of the company with respect to fiscal   and  as well as the first three quarters of fiscal  should be restated to reflect the conclusions from its internal review 
in january  the audit committee took disciplinary actions with respect to the company s employees who it determined bore responsibility for certain of these matters 
there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required  that the historical consolidated financial statements included in the company s previously filed public reports or this report will not change or require amendment  or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances 
in addition  as the sec investigation and us attorney inquiry continue  new issues may be identified  or the audit committee may make additional findings if it receives additional information  that may have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in the company s previously filed public reports or this report 
failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition

the company is subject to various local  state  federal  foreign and transnational laws and regulations  which include the operating and security standards of the dea  the fda  various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments  the nrc  dhhs  the european union member states and other comparable agencies 
certain of the company s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and or licenses with  and comply with operating and security standards of  the dea  the fda  the nrc  dhhs and various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution  manufacturing and sale 
although the company believes that it is in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the company s operations with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits  licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits  licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the company s businesses 
any noncompliance by the company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain  renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition

on august   the company initiated a voluntary field corrective action of the product as a result of information indicating that a sensitive keypad posed a risk of key bounce and could lead to over infusion of patients 
as part of the field corrective action  the company sent letters and warning labels to its customers and is currently 
table of contents testing a modification that reduces sensitivity of the keyboard 
this modification will need to be validated on the product and approved by the fda 
these actions did not require the return of products currently in use by customers and the company currently has no plans of recalling these products 
the company has stopped manufacturing and distribution of the alaris se infusion pumps pending resolution of the issue with the fda 
there have been approximately  alaris se infusion pumps distributed worldwide during the past years and the product line currently represents less than of annual revenue for the clinical technologies and services segment 
the company does not believe that implementation of the modification currently being tested will materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company has not completed its testing or received approval from the fda and if additional remedial actions are deemed necessary by the company or the fda  the effect could become material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company is subject to extensive local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
the federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
many of these laws and regulations are complex and broadly written and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in its operations 
if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could suffer civil and criminal penalties  including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
circumstances associated with the company s acquisition strategy could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
an important element of the company s growth strategy historically has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the company s existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks  including the risk that the company overpays for a business or is unable to obtain the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring the business 
integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks  including the following the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential operating synergies  problems assimilating and retaining the employees of the acquired company or the company s employees following an acquisition  accounting issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  including unforeseen issues related to internal control over financial reporting  regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company  challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses  and potential adverse short term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise

results of operations the following summarizes the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and in millions  except per common share amounts growth results of operations years ended june  revenue operating earnings earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting net earnings net diluted earnings per common share growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year 
growing demand for the company s diversified products and services in fiscal led to record revenue of approximately billion  a increase from fiscal the company s operating earnings increased to nearly billion and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to 
the company placed significant emphasis on improving operating margins  which increased in each reportable segment from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year 
reportable segments the company s operations are organized into four reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services  medical products and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services  and clinical technologies and services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal effective for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june   the company will report financial information for the following five reportable segments supply chain services pharmaceutical  supply chain services medical  medical products manufacturing  pharmaceutical technologies and services  and clinical technologies and services 
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services performance during fiscal  the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment revenue increased  primarily from revenue from bulk customers 
operating earnings within this segment were flat due to the positive impact of signed distribution service agreements and earnings from generic products  offset by decreased selling margins resulting from competitive pressures and a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal reflecting credits owed to certain vendors 
during fiscal  this segment completed its transition to a fee for service business model  as described below under pharmaceutical distribution business model transition 
with the transition to the fee for service business model completed  the segment s operating earnings were more evenly distributed throughout the fiscal year  moderating the historical earnings seasonality 
going forward  this transition will continue to result in less earnings volatility within this segment 

table of contents medical products and services performance revenue and operating earnings within the medical products and services segment increased and  respectively  during fiscal however  these growth rates were adversely impacted by the loss of the specialty distribution business largest customer at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal revenue and operating earnings growth rates were lowered by approximately percentage points and percentage point  respectively  during fiscal due to the loss of this customer and the ultimate sale of a significant portion of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal the segment s operating earnings growth resulted primarily from the favorable year over year comparison from the prior year latex litigation charge  favorable product mix and manufacturing cost reductions 
pharmaceutical technologies and services performance during fiscal  the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment revenue increased due to increased demand for certain proprietary and oral drug delivery formulations  improved terms with existing customers and increased volume on certain sterile products and a significant one time payment from an ongoing customer 
operating earnings decreased within this segment due to the impact of competitive pressures and pricing within the nuclear pharmacy services business and the stronger us dollar during fiscal clinical technologies and services performance during fiscal  the clinical technologies and services segment revenue increased due to increased demand for the segment s core products within both the alaris and pyxis businesses and the introduction of new products 
in addition to the strong revenue growth noted above  this segment s operating earnings increased due to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies and integration synergies from the acquisition of alaris 
pharmaceutical distribution business model transition the company s pharmaceutical distribution business began a business model transition in fiscal regarding the manner in which it was compensated for the services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
historically  pharmaceutical distribution was compensated by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of price inflation 
specifically  a significant portion of the compensation pharmaceutical distribution received from such manufacturers was derived from the company s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of price increases  hold that inventory as manufacturers increased prices  and generate a higher gross margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 
beginning in fiscal  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers sought additional services from the company  including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
these changes significantly reduced the compensation as a percentage of revenue received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in response to these developments  the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers pricing practices  and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
this transition was completed during fiscal these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers price increases 

table of contents under the fee for service arrangements  reflected in written distribution service agreements  the company s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus an inflation based compensation component 
in certain instances  the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement 
the fee is typically a fixed percentage of the company s purchases or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to customers 
apart from its fee for service arrangements reflected in distribution service agreements  the company also continues to be compensated by some branded manufacturers based solely on price inflation 
if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one year term with an automatic renewal feature to a five year term 
these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed to by the parties  a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured  or in the event of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate without cause within a defined notice period 
adoption of sfas no 
r and equity based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  applying the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires all equity based payments to employees  including grants of employee options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for equity based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and equity based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure within the notes to the financial statements 
in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company did not modify the terms of any previously granted options 
the company made significant changes to its equity compensation program with its annual equity grant in the first quarter of fiscal  including reducing the overall number of options granted and utilizing a mix of restricted share and option awards 
the company also moved from three year cliff vesting to installment vesting over four years for annual employee option awards and shortened the option term from ten to seven years 
total company operating earnings for fiscal were adversely affected by the impact of equity based compensation due to the implementation of sfas no 
r and the impact of stock appreciation rights granted to the company s then chairman and chief executive officer during the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded million for equity based compensation during fiscal compared to million in fiscal beyond the current fiscal year  the company expects the equity based compensation expense to decline year over year due primarily to the significant changes made to the company s equity compensation program  including a reduction in the overall number of options granted

total company revenue increased and  respectively  during fiscal and the revenue growth in fiscal resulted from the following increased revenue within each of the company s four reportable segments  including revenue growth of within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment  driven primarily by growth in revenue from bulk customers and within the clinical technologies and services segment  driven primarily by revenue growth within the pyxis and alaris products businesses  pharmaceutical price increases within its pharmaceutical distribution business averaging approximately during fiscal  the addition of new customers  and the addition of new products 
these increases were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the medical products and services segment due to the loss of the specialty distribution business largest customer at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal and the ultimate sale of a significant portion of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment was adversely impacted by competitive pressures and pricing within the nuclear pharmacy services business 
the revenue growth in fiscal resulted from the following revenue growth from existing customers  the addition of new customers  the addition of new products  pharmaceutical price increases within its pharmaceutical distribution business averaging approximately during fiscal  and the year over year impact of acquisitions

bulk customers consist of customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
non bulk customers include retail stores  hospitals  alternate care sites and other customers not specifically classified as bulk customers 
most deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer 
bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers 
non bulk customers  on the other hand  require more complex servicing 
these services include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities  warehousing the product for a longer period of time  picking individual products specific to a customer s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 
bulk customers generate lower margins than non bulk customers because of lower customer pricing and lower vendor margins 
both bulk and non bulk customers generate vendor margins  but such margins for bulk customers are lower due to the impact of product mix 
lower customer pricing and vendor margins for bulk customers  however  are partially offset by the lower cost of servicing bulk customers 
as noted above  deliveries to bulk customers have lower servicing costs related to warehousing and handling than deliveries to non bulk customers 
see the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment s operating earnings discussion below for the significant items impacting margin within this segment 
revenue from bulk customers for fiscal was billion compared to billion in fiscal the increase in revenue from bulk customers primarily relates to additional volume from existing large retail chain customers and market growth with customers in the mail order business

these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities and the national logistics center within the company s pharmaceutical distribution business and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statement of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price inflation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals and consumer products are primarily inflationary  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
under the lifo method  it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold 
as such  the company uses lifo to better match costs and revenues 
therefore  reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining brand pharmaceutical and consumer product inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of goods sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment 
conversely  reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of goods sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment 
in fiscal  the lifo credit of million was primarily due to price deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories 
the lifo credit in fiscal of million was primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories  lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation for all inventory  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would not have changed in fiscal and would have increased million in due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories  inventories at lifo are approximately million higher than its fifo value as of june  however  the company s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 
below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory june  in millions fifo inventory lifo reserve valuation total inventory 
table of contents inventories recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were million and million  respectively  at june  and june  the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the company s assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required  however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
accordingly  the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in conducting the impairment test  the fair value of the company s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
the company s impairment analysis is based on a review of the price earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature  scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been consistently applied for the periods presented 
the discount rate used for impairment testing is based on the risk free rate plus an adjustment for risk factors 
the use of alternative estimates  peer groups or changes in the industry  or adjusting the discount rate used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment 
any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company s results of operations 
the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal and  neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges 
decreasing the price earnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units for fiscal or an increase in the price earnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing or a decrease in the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis would not adversely affect the computed fair value of the reporting units 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
business combinations assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
the company typically utilizes third party valuation experts for this process 
in addition  current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company s research and development projects to determine the existence of in process research and development ipr d 
the company has not historically recorded significant costs related to ipr d 
however  in conjunction with the acquisition of alaris  the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assessed the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value 
costs were not assigned to ipr d unless future development was probable 
once the fair value was determined  an asset was established and  as 
table of contents required by us gaap  immediately written off as a special item in the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
the company recorded million as a special item in fiscal representing an estimate of alaris ipr d see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
special items the company s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity 
integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
certain costs related to these acquisitions  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 
the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
certain costs to be incurred by the company as the acquirer  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  are recognized at the date the integration plan is committed to and adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 
at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities 
under this standard  a liability for most types of exit costs is recognized as incurred 
as discussed above  the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf issue no 
 which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
the majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments and other integration costs 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
the company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent  non recurring or unusual in nature as special items 
in addition  costs related to legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters are also classified as special items 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
vendor reserves the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors 
in determining appropriate vendor reserves  the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims 
the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors  company policy and 
table of contents findings of research performed 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences 
changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
at june  and june   vendor reserves were million and million  respectively 
approximately of the vendor reserve at june  and june  pertained to the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment 
fluctuations in the reserve balance are also caused by the variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in the operating earnings discussion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period  unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate  and thus  have a financial impact on the period s financial results 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company s original estimate and may require adjustment 
however  the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
equity based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r applying the modified prospective method 
this statement requires all equity based payments to employees  including grants of options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a black scholes model 
the company s estimate of an option s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events 
these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include  but are not limited to  stock price volatility  the expected option life  expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates 
effective with all options granted during fiscal  the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant years 
the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates 
the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors 
once employee stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results 
however  sfas no 
r requires the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding equity based compensation 
income taxes the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company had net deferred income tax assets of million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of  million and  million at june  
table of contents and  respectively 
included in the net deferred income tax assets are net federal  state and local  and international loss and credit carryforwards at june  and of million and million  respectively 
the company has established a net valuation allowance of million at june  against certain deferred tax assets  which primarily relates to state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
in addition  the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  the company s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period 
the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of the company s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments 
in all cases  the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its conclusions 
amounts accrued for a particular period are adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred 
the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
in addition to income mix from geographical regions  the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
although not material to the effective tax rate for the three fiscal years ended june   if any of the company s assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase decrease in the company s effective tax rate by on earnings before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting would have caused income tax expense to increase decrease by million for the fiscal year ended june  loss contingencies the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 
self insurance accruals the company is self insured for employee medical and dental insurance programs 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending 
table of contents claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be million 
if the amount of claims  medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated  the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required 
however  the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
medical and dental insurance expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  the company has certain deductibles or is self insured for various risks including general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation 
however  claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial insurers 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to liability  property and workers compensation at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs  claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
for certain types of exposures the company uses third parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim 
for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices 
the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates 
although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june   it is possible  based on generally accepted actuarial analysis  that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june  by as much as million 
the insurance expense for general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal  and fiscal years ended june  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities

recent developments 
on august   the company announced that is has suspended production  sales  repairs and installation of its alaris se infusion pump after approximately  units were seized by the fda 
on august   the company initiated a voluntary field corrective action of the product as a result of information indicating that a sensitive keypad posed a risk of key bounce and could lead to over infusion of patients 
as part of the field corrective action  the company sent letters and warning labels to its customers and is currently testing a modification that reduces sensitivity of the keypad 
this modification will need to be validated on the product and approved by the fda 
these actions did not require the return of products currently in use by customers and the company currently has no plans of recalling these products 
the company has stopped manufacturing and distribution of the alaris se infusion pumps pending resolution of the issue with the fda 
there have been approximately  alaris se infusion pumps distributed worldwide during the past years and the product line currently represents less than of annual revenue for the clinical technologies and services segment 
the company does not believe that implementation of the modification currently being tested will materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company has not completed its testing or received approval from the fda and if additional remedial actions are deemed necessary by the company or the fda  the effect could become material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional subsequent events after june  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks 
these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate  and commodity related changes 
the company maintains a comprehensive hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures 
it employs operational  economic  and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the company s use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity 
by nature of the company s global operations  it is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
since the company manufactures and sells its products throughout the world  its foreign currency risk is diversified 
principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the european euro  mexican peso  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and thai baht 

table of contents transactional exposure the company s transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries 
as part of its risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year the company performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
the analysis utilizes an implied volatility measurement for each currency to estimate the net potential gain or loss 
the analysis assumed a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the u 
s dollar 
included in the analysis is the estimated impact of its hedging program  which mitigates the company s transactional exposure 
at june  and  the company had hedged approximately and  respectively  of its transactional exposures

s dollars  the functional currency of the parent 
it performs a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure 
the company does not typically hedge any of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in the company s analysis at june  and the following table summarizes the company s translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the u 
s dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss interest rate sensitivity 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the company s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
the company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of its risk management program  the company annually performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity 
the company purchases certain commodities for use in its manufacturing processes  which include latex  heating oil  diesel fuel and polystyrene  among others 
the company typically purchases these commodities at market prices  and as a result  is affected by price fluctuations 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
at june  and  the company had not hedged any of these exposures 
the table 
table of contents below summarizes the company s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss the company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through its normal course of business 
these exposures result primarily from operating the company s distribution  manufacturing  and corporate facilities 
in certain deregulated markets  the company from time to time enters into long term purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price
