overview we are a nationwide provider of equipment financing solutions primarily to small businesses 
we finance over categories of commercial equipment important to businesses including copiers  telephone systems  computers  and certain commercial and industrial equipment 
we access our end user customers through origination sources comprised of our existing network of independent equipment dealers and  to a lesser extent  through relationships with lease brokers and through direct solicitation of our end user customers 
our leases are fixed rate transactions with terms generally ranging from to months 
at december   our lease portfolio consisted of approximately  accounts  from approximately  customers  with an average original term of months  and average transaction size of approximately  since our founding in  we have grown to million in total assets at december  our assets are substantially comprised of our net investment in leases which totaled million at december  our lease portfolio grew in personnel costs represent our most significant overhead expense and we have added to our staffing levels to both support and grow our lease portfolio 
since inception  we have also added four regional sales offices to help us penetrate certain targeted markets  with our most recent office in salt lake city  utah 
the salt lake city office is expected to become fully operational by the end of the second quarter of growing the lease portfolio  while maintaining asset quality  remains the primary focus of management 
we expect our on going investment in our sales teams and regional offices to drive continued growth in our lease portfolio 
our revenue consists of interest and fees from our leases and  to a lesser extent  income from our property insurance program and other fee income 
our expenses consist of interest expense and operating expenses  which include salaries and benefits and other general and administrative expenses 
as a credit lender  our earnings are also significantly impacted by credit losses 
for the year ended december   our net credit losses were of our average net investment in leases 
we establish reserves for credit losses which require us to estimate expected losses in our portfolio 

table of contents our leases are classified as direct financing leases under generally accepted accounting principles  and we recognize interest income over the term of the lease 
direct financing leases transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the equipment lessee 
our investment in leases is reflected in our financial statements as net investment in direct financing leases 
net investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of total minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual value of leased equipment  less unearned lease income 
unearned lease income consists of the excess of the total future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term plus deferred net initial direct costs and fees less the cost of the related equipment 
approximately of our lease portfolio amortizes over the term to a residual value 
for the remainder of the portfolio  we must estimate end of term residual values for the leased assets 
failure to correctly estimate residual values could result in losses being realized on the disposition of the equipment at the end of the lease term 
since our founding  we have funded our business through a combination of variable rate borrowings and fixed rate asset securitization transactions  as well as through the issuance from time to time of subordinated debt and equity 
our variable rate financing sources consist of a revolving bank facility and two cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we issue fixed rate term debt through the asset backed securitization market 
typically  leases are funded through variable rate borrowings until refinanced through term note securitization at fixed rates 
all of our term note securitizations have been accounted for as on balance sheet transactions and  therefore  we have not recognized gains or losses from these transactions 
as of december  all of our million borrowings were fixed cost term note securitizations 
since we initially finance our fixed rate leases with variable rate financing  our earnings are exposed to unexpected increases in interest rates that may occur before those variable rates can be hedged by a fixed rate term note securitization 
we use derivative contracts to attempt to reduce our exposure to increasing interest rates 
we generally benefit in times of falling and low interest rates 
we are also dependent upon obtaining future financing to refinance our warehouse lines of credit in order to grow our lease portfolio 
we currently plan to complete a fixed rate term note securitization at least once a year 
failure to obtain such financing  or other alternate financing  would significantly restrict our growth and future financial performance 
we have recently filed an application for an industrial bank charter with the fdic and the state of utah department of financial institutions to form marlin business bank 
subject to regulatory approvals  we plan to begin operating the bank in to further diversify our funding by issuing fdic insured deposits 
marlin business bank will operate from our salt lake city office 
reorganization and initial public offering marlin leasing corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  on august   we incorporated marlin business services corp 
in pennsylvania 
on november   we reorganized our operations into a holding company structure by merging marlin leasing corporation with a wholly owned subsidiary of marlin business services corp 
as a result  all former shareholders of marlin leasing corporation became shareholders of marlin business services corp 
after the reorganization  marlin leasing corporation remains in existence as our primary operating subsidiary 
in november   shares of our common stock were issued in connection with our ipo 
of these shares  a total of  shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
the initial public offering price was per share resulting in net proceeds to us  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  of approximately million 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we 
table of contents evaluate our estimates  including credit losses  residuals  initial direct costs and fees  other fees and realization of deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies  the most significant of which are described below 
income recognition 
interest income is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
when a lease is days or more delinquent  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and we do not recognize interest income on that lease until the lease is less than days delinquent 
fee income consists of fees for delinquent lease payments and cash collected on early termination of leases 
fee income also includes net residual income which includes income from lease renewals and gains and losses on the realization of residual values of equipment disposed of at the end of term 
fee income from delinquent lease payments is recognized on an accrual basis based on anticipated collection rates 
other fees are recognized when received 
net residual income includes charges for the reduction in estimated residual values on equipment for leases in renewal and is recognized during the renewal period 
residual balances at lease termination which remain uncollected more than days are charged against income 
insurance income is recognized on an accrual basis as earned over the term of the lease 
payments that are days or more past due are charged against income 
ceding commissions  losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded in the period incurred and netted against insurance income 
initial direct costs and fees 
we defer initial direct costs incurred and fees received to originate our leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the initial direct costs and fees we defer are part of the net investment in direct financing leases and are amortized to interest income using the effective interest method 
we defer third party commission costs as well as certain internal costs directly related to the origination activity 
the costs include evaluating the prospective lessee s financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing and processing lease documents and closing the transaction 
the fees we defer are documentation fees collected at lease inception 
the realization of the deferred initial direct costs  net of fees deferred  is predicated on the net future cash flows generated by our lease portfolio 
lease residual values 
a direct financing lease is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual values less unearned income 
residual values reflect the estimated amounts to be received at lease termination from lease extensions  sales or other dispositions of leased equipment 
these estimates are based on industry data and on our experience 
management performs periodic reviews of the estimated residual values and any impairment  if other than temporary  is recognized in the current period 
allowance for credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for credit losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates based on our projection of probable net credit losses 
to project probable net credit losses  we perform a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that an account will progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately be charged off 
in addition to the migration analysis  we also consider other factors including recent trends in delinquencies and charge offs  accounts filing for bankruptcy  recovered amounts  forecasting uncertainties  the composition of our lease portfolio  economic conditions  and seasonality 
we then establish an allowance for credit losses for the projected probable net credit losses based on this analysis 
a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
our policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent 
our projections of probable net credit losses are inherently uncertain  and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such losses 
changes in economic conditions  the risk characteristics and composition of the portfolio  bankruptcy laws  and other factors could impact our actual and projected net credit losses and the related 
table of contents allowance for credit losses 
to the degree we add new leases to our portfolio  or to the degree credit quality is worse than expected  we will record expense to increase the allowance for credit losses for the estimated net losses expected in our lease portfolio 
derivatives 
sfas  as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires recognition of all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the accounting standard 
for derivatives not designated or qualifying for hedge accounting  the related gain or loss is recognized in earnings for each period and included in other income or financing related costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivatives designated for hedge accounting  initial assessments are made as to whether the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective and on going periodic assessments may be required to determine the on going effectiveness of the hedge 
the gain or loss on derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting is recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet net of tax effects unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges or in current period earnings depending on the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
stock based compensation 
we issue both restricted shares and stock options to certain employees and directors as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the company follows the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we record deferred compensation for option grants to employees for the amount  if any  by which the fair value per share exceeds the exercise price per share at the measurement date  which is generally the grant date 
this deferred compensation is recognized over the vesting period 
pursuant to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company discloses net income as if compensation expense for stock option grants had been determined based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
in we will adopt sfas no 
r share based payments  an amendment of fasb statements and  which requires companies to recognize expense on the grant date for the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and non employees 
the company plans to use the modified prospective method whereby awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with statement r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to date will be accounted for in accordance with statement r and expensed as the awards vest based on their grant date fair value 
we will adopt this rule in the first quarter of and anticipate recognizing approximately  of expense for the vesting of previously issued stock options in warrants 
we issued warrants to purchase our common stock to the holders of our subordinated debt that was repaid in november in accordance with eitf issue no 
 codified in eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we initially classified the warrants fair value as a liability since the warrant holders had the ability to put to the company the shares of common stock exercisable under the warrants under certain conditions to us for cash settlement 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrants were recorded in the accompanying statement of operations 
the charge to operations in was million 
under the terms of the warrant agreement  the warrants were exercised into common stock at the time of our ipo and the total warrant liability balance of million was reclassified back to equity and  therefore  there are no effects on subsequent operations in or income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  for example  leases for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
our management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent our management believes recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance in a period  an expense must be recorded within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

table of contents our net operating loss carryforwards nols as of december  for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols expire in periods beginning to the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the nols available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
a change in the ownership of a company greater than within a three year period results in an annual limitation on a company s ability to utilize its nols from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
management believes that the reorganization and initial public offering did not have a material effect on its ability to utilize these nols 
no valuation allowance has been established against net deferred tax assets related to our nols  as our management believes these nols will be realizable through reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  and future taxable income 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and net income 
net income was million for the year ended december  this represented a million  or  increase from million net income reported for the year ended december  our increased earnings are primarily the result of growth and improved net interest and fee margins in our core leasing business 
during the third quarter of  the company increased its reserves for expected credit losses based on its initial assessments of exposure to areas significantly impacted by hurricane katrina such as new orleans 
the impact of this increase in reserves was a reduction of approximately  in net income for the year diluted net income per share was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we generated  new leases at a cost of million compared to  new leases at a cost of million for the year ended december  the weighted average implicit interest rate on new leases originated was for the year ended december  compared to for year ended december  overall  the net investment in direct financing leases grew  to million at december  from million at december  returns on average assets were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  returns on average equity were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our debt to equity ratio was at december  compared to at december  year ended december  dollars in thousands interest income fee income interest and fee income interest expense net interest and fee income average net investment in direct financing leases percent of average net investment in direct financing leases interest income fee income interest and fee income interest expense net interest and fee margin excludes allowance for credit losses and initial direct costs and fees deferred 

table of contents net interest and fee margin 
net interest and fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the net interest and fee margin represents an increase of basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  with the increase primarily attributed to fee income 
interest income  net of amortized initial direct costs and fees  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a growth in average net investment in direct financing leases dfl which increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our interest income yield on assets declined by basis point for the year ended december  to as a percentage of average net investment in dfl from for the year ended december  the interest income yield on our lease portfolio declined by basis points for the year ended december  to as a percentage of average net investment in dfl from for the year ended december  this decline was due in part to lower weighted average implicit interest rates on new leases originated in the year ended december  than in years prior and the amortization and payoffs of older higher yielding leases 
this reduction was partially offset by a basis point increase in earnings on cash balances which grew to as a percentage of average net investment in dfl for the year ended compared to for the year ended december  fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  all major components of fee income contributed to the increase in fiscal year consistent with the continued growth and seasoning of our lease portfolio

the federal reserve increased its targeted fed funds rate eight times for a total of during and a total of thirteen times or since june these increases have increased interest rates on libor and prime interest rate based loans such as the company s warehouse facilities and created a higher interest rate environment in which to issue term note securitizations 
interest expense as a percentage of weighted average borrowings was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the average balance for our warehouse facilities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the average borrowing costs for our warehouse facilities was for the year ended december  compared to for year ended december  reflecting the higher interest rate environment

table of contents interest coupon approximating over the term of the financing 
after the effects of hedging and other transaction costs are considered  we expect total interest expense on the term transaction to approximate an average of over the term of the borrowing 
in july we issued million in term securitizations with an approximate average total interest expense of over the term of the borrowing 
our term securitizations include multiple classes of fixed rate notes with the shorter term  lower coupon classes amortizing maturing faster then the longer term higher coupon classes 
this causes the blended interest expenses related to these borrowings to change and generally increase over the term of the borrowing 
on august  we elected to exercise our call option and pay off our term securitization when the remaining note balances outstanding were million at a coupon rate of approximately

insurance and other income 
insurance and other income increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to higher net insurance income earned in during the fourth quarter of  we expensed approximately  in insurance claims from the gulf states region of the usa attributed to the effects of hurricane katrina

financing related costs include commitment fees paid to our financing sources and costs pertaining to our derivative contracts used to limit our exposure to possible increases in interest rates 
financing related costs decreased  to million for the year period ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due principally to lower costs associated with mark to market adjustments for derivative contracts in the period

this additional reserve was initially estimated based on our total estimated exposure of million in net investment in direct financing leases in the most affected areas at the time 
through december   we have yet to experience any significant charge offs related to hurricane katrina 
however  we have restructured approximately million in net investment in leases in the gulf states region by deferring payments on such leases generally until january we continue to monitor this portion of our portfolio as a specifically identified segment outside of our normal migration analysis 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in tax expense is primarily attributed to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate  which is a combination of federal and state income tax rates  was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we anticipate our effective tax rate in future years to approximate our effective tax rate 
comparison of the years ended december  and net income

accordingly  this expense has not continued beyond fiscal year provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in our provision for credit losses was a result of growth of our lease portfolio and the corresponding proportional growth in net charge offs

the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in tax expense is primarily attributed to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate  which is a combination of federal and state income tax rates  was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was heavily impacted by the expense associated with the changes in fair value of warrants which is a non deductible expense 
earnings per common share in conjunction with our november reorganization and ipo  warrants were exercised and convertible preferred stock converted  and our capital structure simplified into one class of common stock outstanding 
the number of common shares issued as a result of these conversions was million  or approximately of total common shares outstanding following the ipo 
because of the significant impact on share count and the related impact on operations from warrant valuations and preferred dividends  we believe a pro forma analysis of diluted eps for the year provides a more meaningful basis to evaluate performance of the company over the past three fiscal years 
the following analysis reconciles eps calculations on a gaap basis to pro forma eps which assumes the exercise of the of warrants and the conversion of the convertible preferred stock as of the beginning of

operating data we manage expenditures using a comprehensive budgetary review process 
expenses are monitored by departmental heads and are reviewed by senior management monthly 
the efficiency ratio relating expenses with revenues and the ratio of salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of the average net investment in direct financing leases shown below are metrics used by management to monitor productivity and spending levels

table of contents key growth indicators management evaluates regularly are sales account executive staffing levels and the activity of our origination sources  which are shown below 
as of or for the year ended december  number of sales account executives number of originating sources monthly average of origination sources generating lease volume 
residual performance our leases offer our end user customers the option to own the purchased equipment at lease expiration 
based on the minimum lease payments receivable as of december   approximately of our leases were one dollar purchase option leases  were fair market value leases and were fixed purchase option leases  the latter of which typically are of the original equipment cost 
as of december   there were million of residual assets retained on our balance sheet of which million or were related to copiers 
as of december   there were million of residual assets retained on our balance sheet of which million or were related to copiers 
no other group of equipment represented more than of equipment residuals as of december  and  respectively 
improvements in technology and other market changes  particularly in copiers  could adversely impact our ability to realize the recorded residual values of this equipment 
our leases generally include automatic renewal provisions and many leases continue beyond their initial term 
we consider renewal income a component of residual performance 
for the years ended december    and renewal income  net of depreciation amounted to million  million  and million and net gains losses on residual values disposed at end of term amounted to   and  respectively 
the increase in net residual income is generally consistent with past customer behavior in electing renewal options  the growth in our lease portfolio and an increased number of leases where we retain a residual interests reaching end of term

calculated as a percentage of minimum lease payments receivable 

table of contents we generally expect net charge offs to approximate of average net investment in leases 
net charge offs in were and below our expectation we believe principally due to continued refinement of our credit underwriting and monitoring of our lease portfolio 
also  general economic conditions in the usa have remained favorable as reflected by the federal reserve s actions to increase interest rates 
in the third quarter of we booked additional reserves for expected credit losses of million based on our assessment of information available at the time on our lease portfolio s exposure to those areas most impacted by hurricane katrina in late august marlin estimates that it had approximately million in net investment in leases outstanding in the areas most affected by hurricane katrina 
during the fourth quarter we charged off approximately  and restructured approximately million of these accounts by deferring lessee payments generally until january the longer term impact of this storm on the economy in the gulf states region and our customers remains uncertain 
the additional hurricane katrina reserve was the primary cause of the increase in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net investment in leases to increase to at december  from at december  delinquent accounts days or more past due as a percentage of minimum lease payments receivable declined to at december  from at december  our usual experience and expectation is for slightly higher delinquency rates as of year end as we believe our lessees tend to adjust their payment patterns around the year end 
we also expected higher delinquency rates in the fourth quarter of attributed to hurricane katrina and its impact on our lessees in the gulf states region 
we restructured many accounts in the katrina affected areas by deferring payments until january and  therefore  these accounts did not contribute to delinquency rates as of year end 
we continue to monitor this portion of our portfolio as a specifically identified segment outside of our normal migration analysis 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate and grow 
our primary liquidity need is for new lease originations 
in addition  we need liquidity to pay interest and principal on our borrowings  to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with our securitization transactions  to fund infrastructure and technology investment and to pay administrative and other operating expenses 
we are dependent upon the availability of financing from a variety of funding sources to satisfy these liquidity needs 
historically  we have relied upon four principal types of third party financing to fund our operations borrowings under a revolving bank facility  financing of leases in cp conduit warehouse facilities  financing of leases through term note securitizations  and equity and debt securities with third party investors 
new lease originations are generally funded in the short term with cash from operations or through borrowings under our revolving bank facility or our cp conduit warehouse facilities 
our current plans assume the execution of a term note securitization approximately once a year to refinance and relieve the bank and cp conduit warehouse facilities 
as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under our bank and cp conduit warehouse facilities and  therefore  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity through these facilities in addition to available cash and cash equivalents of million 
in november   shares of our common stock were issued in connection with our ipo 
of these shares  a total of  shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
the initial public offering price was per share resulting in net proceeds to us  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  of approximately million 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
we used the net proceeds from the ipo as follows i approximately million was used to repay all of our outstanding subordinated debt and all accrued interest thereon  ii approximately million was used to pay accrued dividends on preferred stock which converted to common stock at the time of the ipo  iii approximately million was used to pay issuance 
table of contents costs incurred in connection with the ipo 
the remaining million was used to fund newly originated and existing leases in our portfolio and other general business purposes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we used cash in investing activities of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to lease origination activity 
additional liquidity is provided by our cash flow from operations 
we generated cash flow from operations of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect cash from operations  additional borrowings on existing and future credit facilities and  the completion of additional on balance sheet term note securitizations to be adequate to support our operations and projected growth 
cash and cash equivalents 
our objective is to maintain a low cash balance  investing any free cash in leases 
we generally fund our lease originations and growth using advances under our revolving bank facility and our cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we had available cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  restricted cash 
we had million of restricted cash as of december  compared to million at december  restricted cash consists primarily of the cash reserves and advance payment accounts related to our term note securitizations 
borrowings 
our aggregate outstanding secured borrowings amounted to million at december  and million at december  at december   our external financing sources  maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding and unused available commitments  subject to certain minimum equity restrictions and other covenants and conditions  are summarized below for the months ended december  maximum as of december  maximum month end average weighted weighted facility amount amount average amounts average unused amount outstanding outstanding coupon outstanding coupon capacity dollars in thousands revolving bank facility cp conduit warehouse facilities term note securitizations subject to lease eligibility and borrowing base formula 
our term note securitizations are one time fundings that pay down over time without any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
as of december   we had completed seven on balance sheet term note securitizations and repaid four in their entirety 
revolving bank facility 
our revolving bank facility totals million from four financial institutions 
it is secured by leases that meet specified eligibility criteria 
our revolving bank facility provides temporary funding pending the accumulation of sufficient pools of leases for financing through a cp conduit warehouse facility or an on balance sheet term note securitization 
funding under this facility is based on a borrowing base formula and factors in an assumed discount rate and advance rate against the pledged leases 
our weighted average outstanding borrowings under this facility were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we incurred interest expense under this facility of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this facility expires on august  as of december  and december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving bank facility 

table of contents cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we have two cp conduit warehouse facilities that allow us to borrow  repay and re borrow based on a borrowing base formula 
in these transactions  we transfer pools of leases and interests in the related equipment to special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries 
these special purpose entities in turn pledge their interests in the leases and related equipment to an unaffiliated conduit entity  which generally issues commercial paper to investors 
borrowings under these facilities are based on borrowing base formulas and assumed discount rates and advance rates against the pledged collateral combined with specific portfolio concentration criteria 
these facilities are also credit enhanced through third party financial guarantor s insurance policies 
interest expense on these facilities is generally charged based on floating commercial paper rates 
these financing arrangements have minimum annual fee requirements based on anticipated usage of the facilities 
a warehouse facility this facility totals million and expires in october for the year ended december  and the year ended december   the weighted average interest rates were and  respectively 
as of december  and december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
a warehouse facility this facility totals million and expires in april for the year ended december  and year ended december   the weighted average interest rate was and  respectively 
there was outstanding under this facility at december  and million at december  term note securitizations 
since our founding through december   we have completed seven on balance sheet term note securitizations of which three remain outstanding 
in connection with each securitization transaction  we have transferred leases to our wholly owned  special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and issued term debt collateralized by such commercial leases to institutional investors in private securities offerings 
our term note securitizations differ from our cp conduit warehouse facilities primarily in that our term note securitizations have fixed terms  fixed interest rates and fixed principal amounts 
by entering into term note securitizations  we reduce outstanding borrowings under our cp conduit warehouse facilities and revolving bank facility  which increases the amounts available to us under these facilities to fund additional lease originations 
as of december   million of our net investment in direct financing leases was pledged to our term note securitizations 
each of our outstanding term note securitizations is summarized below outstanding scheduled notes originally balance as of maturity original issued december  date coupon rate dollars in thousands class a   may class b   february class c   may class a  august class a   january class a   june class a   may class b   may class c   may

in addition to this coupon interest  term securitizations also have other transaction costs which are amortized over the life of the borrowings as additional interest expense 
original coupon rate represents fixed rate coupon payable on interest rate swap agreement 
certain classes of the term note securitization were issued at variable rates to investors with the company simultaneously entering interest rate swap agreements to convert the borrowings to a fixed interest cost 
for the weighted average term of the term note securitization  the weighted average coupon rate will approximate 
the weighted average coupon rate of the term note securitization will approximate over the term of the borrowing 
financial covenants all of our secured borrowing arrangements have financial covenants we must comply with in order to obtain funding through the facilities and to avoid an event of default 
the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities also contain cross default provisions such that an event of default on any facility would be considered an event of default under the others  in essence simultaneously restricting our ability to access either of these critical sources of funding 
a default by any of our term note securitizations is also considered an event of default under the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities 
some of the critical financial covenants under our borrowing arrangements as of december  include tangible net worth of not less than million  debt to equity ratio of not more than to  fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and interest coverage ratio of not less than to as of december  we believe we were in compliance with all covenants in our borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our credit facilities and term debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases 
the 
table of contents contractual obligations under our agreements  credit facilities  term securitizations  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december  were as follows contractual obligations as of december  operating leased capital borrowings interest leases facilities leases total dollars in thousands thereafter total market interest rate risk and sensitivity market risk is the risk of losses arising from changes in values of financial instruments 
we engage in transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to market risks 
we attempt to mitigate such risks through prudent management practices and strategies such as attempting to match the expected cash flows of our assets and liabilities 
we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates and our earnings may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
the lease assets we originate are almost entirely fixed rate 
accordingly  we generally seek to finance these assets with fixed interest cost term note securitization borrowings that we issue periodically 
between term note securitization issues  we finance our new lease originations through a combination of variable rate warehouse facilities and working capital 
our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings and our exposure to interest rate risk changes over time 
during  the mix of variable rate borrowings has ranged from zero to of total borrowings and averaged 
our highest exposure to variable rate borrowings generally occurs just prior to the issuance of a term note securitization 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to the effects of changes in market interest rates and to fulfill certain covenants in our borrowing arrangements 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value as either assets or liabilities 
accounting for the changes in fair value of derivatives depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas  as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to changing market interest rates prior to issuing a term note securitization 
in this scenario we enter into forward starting swap agreements to coincide with the forecasted pricing date of our next term note securitization 
the value of this derivative contract moves directly with interest rates and our intention is to close these derivative contracts simultaneous with the pricing of our next term securitization and amortize the resulting gain or loss to interest expense over the term of our forecasted securitization 
we may choose to hedge all or a portion of a forecasted transaction 
in june and september  the company entered forward starting interest rate swap agreements with total underlying notional amounts of million to commence in september related to its forecasted term note securitization transaction 
these interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values of million 
these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges with unrealized gains recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet of approximately million  net of tax  as of december  the company expects to terminate these agreements simultaneously with the pricing of its term securitization with any of the unrecognized gains or losses amortized to interest expense over the term of the related borrowing 
in october and december  the company had entered into similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with total underlying notional amounts of million to commence in august related to our term note securitization transaction 
the company terminated these agreements simultaneously with the 
table of contents pricing of its term securitization issued on august  and is amortizing the realized gains of million to interest expense over the term of the related borrowing 
these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges with the gains realized deferred and recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet at approximately million  net of tax  as of december  during the year ended december   the company amortized  of deferred gains to lower interest expense of the related term securitization borrowing 
the company expects to reclassify approximately  net of tax  into earnings over the next twelve months 
we issued a term note securitization on july  where certain classes of notes were issued at variable rates to investors 
we simultaneously entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert these borrowings to a fixed interest cost to the company for the term of the borrowing 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements related to these transactions with underlying notional amounts of million 
these interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values of million and  as of december  and december   respectively 
these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges with unrealized gains recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet of approximately  and  net of tax  as of december  and december   respectively 
the ineffectiveness related to these interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was not material for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recognized a net gain of  in other financing related costs related to the fair values of the interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a net loss of  in other financing related costs related to similar interest rate swaps that were terminated or did not qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   the company had interest rate swap agreements related to non hedge accounting transactions with underlying notional amounts of  these interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at a fair value of  these derivative contracts also related to the term securitization and are intended to offset certain prepayment risks in the lease portfolio pledged in the term securitization 
the company also uses interest rate cap agreements that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment to fulfill certain covenants in our warehouse borrowing arrangements 
accordingly  these cap agreements are recorded at fair value in other assets at  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
changes in the fair values of the caps are recorded in financing related costs in the accompanying statements of operations 
the notional amount of interest rate caps owned as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the company also sells interest rate caps to generate premium revenues to partially offset the premium cost of purchasing its required interest rate caps 
as of december   the notional amount of interest rate cap sold agreements totaled million 
the fair value of interest rate caps sold is recorded in other liabilities at  as of december  there were no similar outstanding sold rate cap agreements at december  
table of contents the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents the expected principal cash flows and the related weighted average interest rates as of december  expected as of and for each year ended through december  and for periods thereafter

the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities are charged a floating rate of interest based on libor  prime rate or commercial paper interest rates 
because our assets are fixed rate  increases in these market interest rates would negatively impact earnings and decreases in the rates would positively impact earnings because the rate charged on our borrowings would change faster than our assets could reprice 
we would have to offset increases in borrowing costs by adjusting the pricing under our new leases or our net interest margin would be reduced 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset higher borrowing costs with increased pricing of our assets 
for example  the impact of a hypothetical basis point  or  increase in the market rates for which our borrowings are indexed for the twelve month period ended december  would have been to reduce net interest and fee income by approximately  based on our average variable rate warehouse borrowings of approximately million for the year then ended  excluding the effects of derivatives  taxes and possible increases in the yields from our lease portfolio due to the origination of new leases at higher interest rates 
we manage and monitor our exposure to interest rate risk using balance sheet simulation models 
such models incorporate many of our assumptions about our business including new asset production and pricing  interest rate forecasts  overhead expense forecasts and assumed credit losses 
past experience drives many of the assumptions used in our simulation models and actual results could vary substantially
