item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking disclaimer please keep the forward looking disclaimer on page in mind as you review the following discussion and analysis 
overview competitive  economic and industry factors we are an energy company 
we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own interests in power generating plants 
all of our five mines supply baseloaded power plants 
several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines and we sell virtually all our coal under long term contracts 
consequently  our mines enjoy relatively stable demand and pricing compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market 
we also earned royalties for the production of coalbed methane gas from the first quarter of until early in in partnership with others  we have developed eight independent power projects totaling mw of generating capacity 
we have sold our interests in five of those projects 
we currently own a interest in the rova i and ii coal fired plants  which have a total generating capacity of mw 
we also retain a interest in the gas fired fort lupton project  which has a generating capacity of mw and provides peaking power to the local utility 
the rova project  which accounted for of our equity in earnings from independent power in  is baseloaded and supplies power pursuant to long term contracts 
according to the annual energy outlook prepared by the eia  approximately of all electricity generated in the united states in was produced by coal fired units 
the eia projects that the demand for coal used to generate electricity will increase per year from through consequently  we believe that the demand for coal will grow  in part because coal is the lowest cost fossil fuel used for generating baseload electric power 
revenues and expenses  sources and uses of cash in  approximately million of our operating income came from coal operations  and almost million came from independent power projects 
this income was mostly offset by over million of expenses in the corporate segment for our heritage health benefit expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  in order to finance the purchase of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  westmoreland mining borrowed million from institutional lenders under a term loan agreement 
by the end of  westmoreland mining had repaid million of that million and deposited an additional million into two restricted accounts for the benefit of its lenders 
in early march  westmoreland mining made arrangements to borrow an additional million from the lenders pursuant to what we call the add on facility 
westmoreland mining borrowed million immediately and the additional million in december the add on facility permits westmoreland mining to undertake certain significant capital projects in the near term without adversely affecting cash available to us 
we may also seek additional capital in for general corporate purposes and to support our growth and development strategy 
meeting our commitment to preferred stockholders we remain committed to meeting our obligation for accumulated dividends to our preferred stockholders 
due to legal and business constraints  no dividends were declared from the third quarter of until on october  and for the following three quarters  a partial dividend of per depositary share was paid 
in october and october  the quarterly dividend was increased to and  respectively 
as of january   million of arrearages had accumulated per preferred share or per depositary share 
a quarterly dividend of per depositary share will be paid on april   to stockholders of record on march  the accumulated amount will continue to increase until we pay quarterly dividends of per depositary share 
challenges we believe that our principal challenges today include the following re determining sales prices to reflect significantly higher market prices and commodity and production costs  addressing the potential impact of limited availability of tires for heavy equipment used at our mines  high ongoing heritage health benefit expenses associated with inflation in medical costs  potentially longer life expectancies for retirees and active employees and the failure of the umwa health and benefit fund to manage those costs  maintaining and collateralizing  where necessary  our coal act and reclamation bonds  funding required contributions to pension plans that are underfunded at the end of  providing adequate capital for on going operations and our growth initiatives  completing the acquisition of lg e s interest in the rova project and obtaining the necessary financing  implementation of a new company wide computer system to support our mining and corporate segments  integration of new personnel  especially in the area of finance and accounting  new environmental regulations  which have the potential to significantly reduce sales from our mines  and claims for potential taxes and royalties asserted by various governmental entities 
we discuss these issues  as well as the other challenges we face  elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and under risk factors 
internal control over financial reporting we had two material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in in connection with the audit of our financial statements  we identified matters involving our internal controls over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses as defined by the public company accounting oversight board in auditing standard no 
 pursuant to which material weaknesses are defined as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected  and a significant deficiency is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that adversely affects our ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
we are committed to maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
our accounting personnel report regularly to our audit committee on all accounting and financial matters 
in addition  our audit committee actively communicates with and oversees the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm 
we describe the actions that we have taken in response to the identification of the material weakness in more detail in item a controls and procedures 
we believe we have remediated the material weaknesses that were identified in connection with the audit of our financial statements 
however  we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
see item a  risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and related matters our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have made significant judgments and estimates in connection with the following accounting matters 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the section below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in connection with our discussion of these critical accounting matters  and in order to reduce repetition  we also use this section to present information related to these judgments and estimates 
postretirement benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligations are the obligations to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements for current information about these assumptions  estimates  and obligations 
estimates and judgments we estimate the total amount of these obligations with the help of third party professionals using actuarial assumptions and information 
our estimates are sensitive to judgments we make about the discount rate  about the rate of inflation in medical costs  about mortality rates  and about the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of or medicare reform act 
we review these estimates and obligations at least annually 
we pay these obligations currently and will have continuing obligations for future periods 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to estimate the present value of these obligations 
in order to do this  we make a judgment about the discount rate  which is an estimate about the current interest rate at which these obligations could be effectively settled on the date we estimate them 
significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our financial statements by influencing our estimate of these amounts 
the recent trend of decreasing discount rates has significantly increased the present value of our obligations and our reported costs 
in order to estimate the total cost of our obligation to provide medical benefits  we must make a judgment about the rate of inflation in medical costs 
as our estimate of the rate of inflation of medical costs increases  our calculation of the total cost of providing these benefits increases 
our accruals for postretirement medical  pension  workers compensation and black lung benefits are also affected by the mortality rate of the population for which we provide benefits 
as people live longer  the cost of providing these benefits increases 
however  the number of assigned beneficiaries for our company under the coal act is fixed  since we discontinued our eastern underground operations  and the primary beneficiaries are elderly 
related information actuarial valuations project that our retiree health benefit costs for current employees and retirees will continue at the current level in the near term and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
we expect to incur lower cash payments for workers compensation benefits in than in and expect that amount to decline over time 
we anticipate that these payments will decline because we are no longer self insured for workers compensation benefits and have had no new claimants since we do not pay pension or black lung benefits directly 
these benefits are paid from trusts that we established and funded 
as of december   our pension trusts were underfunded by million  and we expect to contribute approximately million to these trusts in as of december   our black lung trust was overfunded by million  and we do not expect to be required to make additional contributions to this trust 
the coal act  passed in  established three benefit plans 
first  the statute merged the umwa and plans into the cbf 
the cbf provides benefits to a closed pool of beneficiaries  retirees who were actually receiving benefits from either the or plan as of july  the coal act requires that the benefits provided to this group remain substantially the same as provided by the and plans as of january  this group is essentially medicare eligible and the cbf supplements the benefits this group receives under medicare 
second  the coal act requires companies that had established individual employer plans  or ieps  pursuant to prior collective bargaining agreements to maintain those ieps and provide the beneficiaries a level of benefits substantially the same as they received as of january  the beneficiaries of these statutorily required ieps are retirees meeting age and service requirements as of february  and who actually retired before september  third  the coal act established the umwa benefit plan which serves three distinct populations miners who were eligible to retire as of february  and actually retired before september  and whose employers are no longer in business  miners receiving benefits under an iep but whose former employer went out of business  and new spouses or new dependants of retirees in the cbf 
as required by the coal act  we maintain an iep for our own retirees  and we pay premiums that cover a portion of the retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
in addition  and separate from the coal act  we continue to provide benefits under another iep to a smaller group of former umwa employees who retired under our last collective bargaining agreement  which ended in one of the estimates we have made relates to the implementation of the medicare reform act 
as provided for under that act  we recognized a benefit to our anticipated future prescription drug costs for retirees and their dependents in based on a coordinated implementation of the medicare reform act and our existing benefit programs  including the umwa plan 
in  the government issued regulations which made the subsidy approach the only practical alternative given our existing programs 
in october  we adopted the subsidy approach for the subsidy approach will limit our annual benefit to to a maximum of  participant of actual costs 
a revised actuarial analysis reduced the projected net present value benefit to us from the medicare reform act as reflected in our postretirement medical obligations  but caused a higher resultant future annual expense of approximately million compared to what we had previously anticipated with a coordinated benefits approach 
asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and the reclamation of land upon cessation of mining 
we account for reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
asset retirement obligations or sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which we incur that obligation 
we capitalize the present value of our estimated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
certain of the company s customers have either agreed to reimburse the company for reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
these funds will serve as sources for use in final reclamation activities 
the liability asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet represents our estimate of the present value of the cost of closing our mines and reclaiming land that has been disturbed by mining 
this liability increases as land is mined and decreases as reclamation work is performed and cash expended 
the asset  property  plant and equipment capitalized asset retirement costs  remains constant until new liabilities are incurred or old liabilities are re estimated 
we estimate the future costs of reclamation using standards for mine reclamation that have been established by the government agencies that regulate our operations as well as our own experience in performing reclamation activities 
these estimates can and do change 
developments in our mining program also affect this estimate by influencing the timing of reclamation expenditures 
adopting sfas no 
significantly affected our financial statements 
see the summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  which includes a discussion of the effect on our financial statements of adopting sfas no 
however  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our cash costs  because the annual cash requirements for reclamation activities are the same using sfas no 
and the units of production accrual method  the accounting method we used prior to adopting sfas no 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for current information about these obligations  costs and reserve estimates 
deferred income taxes estimates and judgments our net income is sensitive to estimates we make about our ability to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete analysis of our current income tax position 
as of december   we have significant nols 
these nols expire at various dates through when we have taxable income  we can use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
our ability to use our nols thus depends on all the factors that determine taxable income  including operational factors  such as new coal sales  and non operational factors  such as increases in heritage health benefit expenses 
under federal tax law  our ability to use our nols would be limited if we had a change of ownership within the meaning of the federal tax code 
our nols are one of our deferred income tax assets 
we estimate the results of future operations that will generate taxable income to realize these deferred income tax assets 
based on this estimate  however  we have reduced our deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is primarily an estimate of the deferred tax assets that will more likely than not expire before they can be realized in future periods 
on an annual basis we estimate how much of our nols we will be able to use to shield future taxable income and make corresponding adjustments in the valuation allowance 
if we increase our estimated utilization of nols  we decrease the valuation allowance  increase our net deferred income tax assets and recognize an income tax benefit in earnings 
if we decrease our estimated utilization of nols  we increase the valuation allowance  decrease our net deferred income tax assets and increase income tax expense 
these changes can materially affect our net income and our assets 
we also make other adjustments in our net deferred tax assets related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
at december  the valuation allowance for federal tax purposes was million and relates primarily to nols that will expire if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income 
related information under the federal tax laws  there are two types of taxable income and two types of net operating loss carryforwards  both of which generally differ from reported pretax income on our consolidated financial statements 
regular taxable income is generally less than our reported pre tax income 
the two types of taxable income are regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income  or amti 
amti differs from regular taxable income in that amti does not allow certain deductions  such as percentage depletion 
we have significant percentage depletion because of our mining activities 
the two types of nols are regular nols and alternative minimum tax  or amt  nols 
our nols are important to our strategy 
regular nols can offset our future regular taxable income  permit us to avoid payment of regular federal income tax  and thereby increase our cash flow and return from profitable investments as compared to the return that would be received by a tax paying entity that cannot shield its income from federal income taxation 
however  regular nols will not shield our income from amt 
we are subject to amt at a rate 
as of december   we had amt net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
only of our amti can be shielded each year by our amt nols 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income  we expect to fully utilize our remaining amt nols by and would normally begin paying the full amt in however  amt will be paid only after we use the indian coal production tax credits generated from to discussed below and will continue until we fully utilize our regular nols after that 
any amt we pay is available as a credit against future regular federal income tax 
these credits do not expire 
as a strategic matter  we may face choices between business strategies intended to maximize the use of our regular nols and strategies that seek to increase our after tax profits  including the effects of amt 
some of these strategies may involve decisions about business activities that generate amti  and many of these choices will require us to make judgments about matters that will arise in the future and that are therefore inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the figures below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars contractual obligations and commitments total after westmoreland mining term debt      other debt    interest on debt       operating leases      workers compensation   combined benefit fund multiemployer        postretirement medical       qualified pension benefits       serp benefits   pneumoconiosis        reclamation costs        preferred dividends        per year at december   westmoreland mining had deposited million in two restricted accounts as collateral against these obligations 
in calculating the amount of interest on debt  we have assumed that the interest rate on westmoreland mining s million of floating rate debt would not increase or decrease from the december  rate 
we have not accrued the present value of this obligation  because this plan is a multiemployer plan 
we expense our premium payments when due 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and the unrecognized net transition obligation  was million as of december  the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
the expected pension benefit payments shown above will be made from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial gain and an unrecognized prior service cost  was million as of december  the plan was unfunded at december  the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
pneumoconiosis benefits will be paid from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross cost of final reclamation 
the accrued liability of million as of december  will increase in present value as acres are disturbed in mining operations and as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability reflects the present value of contractual obligations of our customers and of washington group  the contract miner at the absaloka mine  to perform reclamation  we estimate that the present value of their combined obligations is million 
the table does not reflect million  the amount held in escrow as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of the rosebud mine  or million in restricted cash for other mines 
in addition  the absaloka contract mine operator is funding a separate reclamation escrow account that is approximately million as of december  we estimate that the present value of our net obligation for final reclamation that is  the costs of final reclamation that are not the contractual responsibilities of others is million at december  represents quarterly dividends that are accumulated through and including january  as provided in the certificate of designation establishing the series a preferred stock  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds of the corporation legally available therefore 
in general  dividends that are not paid accumulate  as provided in the certificate of designation 
the rova project s debt is not listed in the table above because  at december   we were required to account for our investment in the rova project using the equity method of accounting 
if we complete the rova acquisition  we will no longer account for our investment in the rova project using the equity method  and the rova project s debt will be fully consolidated in our financial statements with our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries 
the rova project had outstanding indebtedness of million at december   and the principal of that debt is payable from through growth and development strategy our growth and development strategy is founded on the ownership and operation of assets that generate profits 
we strive to identify assets that are low cost suppliers and environmental leaders and that supply customers who share our orientation for low cost supply and our environmental concern 
we believe that we will be more likely to achieve success in niche markets 
our goal is to acquire stable  long term earnings 
we will use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
the acquisitions we completed in exemplify this strategy 
among other things  the rosebud  jewett  beulah and savage mines are essentially adjacent to their principal customers  to which they deliver coal by conveyor belt or truck  and are the lowest cost suppliers for their respective customers 
these mines principal customers all employ modern emissions control technology 
these mines are party to long term contracts with their principal customers that generate relatively stable earnings 
examples of our current development efforts include the following in august  we signed a purchase agreement with lg e to acquire lg e s interest in the rova project 
while this acquisition has been delayed by litigation over the customer s alleged right of first refusal  we are currently in discussion with the customer in the hope that we can resolve the dispute on mutually acceptable business terms 
in  as part of our transaction with knife river  we acquired rights to develop the lignite deposits at gascoyne  north dakota 
our subsidiary  westmoreland power  inc  then joined with mdu resources group  inc 
to pursue development of a baseloaded lignite fired power plant near gascoyne as part of the state of north dakota s lignite vision lv program 
lv is a partnership between north dakota and the lignite energy council lec that is administered by the north dakota industrial commission ndic 
westmoreland power and mdu executed a joint development agreement in  and we each own half of the venture that is seeking to develop the power plant 
in september  ndic awarded the westmoreland mdu joint venture up to million in matching funds to finance feasibility and technical studies 
in january  as a result of these studies  we and mdu sought additional support from ndic to study the feasibility of substituting a mw or mw power plant for the mw plant that had originally been proposed 
ndic awarded the funds sought  and we and mdu completed studies of generation technology  and lignite mining issues in air quality evaluation was completed in early in may  we and mdu filed an application for an air permit for a proposed mw plant and a completeness determination was received in july the north dakota department of health department of health issued a draft air permit on march  the department of health issued the final air permit in june  after holding a day public comment period and a public hearing 
we also continue to identify and evaluate other potential growth opportunities in the coal and independent power sections 
an existing source of future income and cash flow relates to the caballo mine in campbell county  wyoming 
in connection with the acquisitions  we acquired the stock of horizon coal services  inc horizon s only asset is a royalty interest in coal reserves located at the caballo mine  which is owned by a company that is not affiliated with us 
the royalty of per ton covers the mining of million tons of coal  making the potential gross royalty amount million 
the latest mine plan projects that mining of coal subject to the royalty is expected to begin in mid year and continue to in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k  we describe our possible acquisition of lg e s interest in the rova project  including the current status 
we describe the financial aspects of that transaction in more detail below under financial implications of the rova acquisition 
as a strategic matter  owning of the rova project would give us an additional long lived asset whose value  we believe  extends well beyond the expiration of the rova project s existing contracts with dominion in it also should enhance our ability to develop and implement strategies to restructure the project s contracts with its principal customer  dominion  and with the project s lenders  to the mutual benefit of all parties  including us  as owners 
the rova acquisition also would double the number of megawatts of generated power that we own and substantially expands the foundation for further growth of the power segment of our business 
such growth may include the development and construction of additional power generating units at the rova site  the gascoyne site or elsewhere 
such growth may also include the operation of power plants 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in the overview section above  westmoreland mining s add on facility substantially improved our liquidity during and in addition  even though the requirements of westmoreland mining s basic term loan agreement  including debt service requirements  restrict our access to some of westmoreland mining s cash  westmoreland mining itself provides liquidity to westmoreland coal company 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in cash from operations in compared to increased because of several factors which include we sold more coal at higher prices at the jewett mine due to restructuring of the contract with its customer  where in  unusually high rainfall disrupted production and costs of commodities increased to a greater extent than customer revenue 
we had significantly higher distributions from the rova project in compared to  because in the project s lenders withheld million of which our share was million as a reserve for a disputed personal property assessment by halifax county  north carolina and in connection with a scheduled maintenance outage 
mandatory contributions to our defined benefit pension plans declined to million in compared to million in contributions in we received a payment at the jewett mine of million in that was related to operations 
we also increased cash from working capital during primarily through higher levels of accounts payable  net of slightly higher receivables and inventory levels 
we used million of cash for investing activities in  million in and million in in  additions to property and equipment totaled million reflecting continued investment in mine equipment and development and over million for implementation of a corporate wide computer system 
we also deposited million into our restricted cash accounts  pursuant to westmoreland mining s term loan agreement and as collateral for our surety bonds 
cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment for mine equipment and development projects 
cash used in investing activities in also included a million increase in restricted cash accounts 
additions to property  plant and equipment in were million and increases in restricted cash accounts were million 
during  net proceeds from sales of assets of million included million cash received from the sale of dta and million received from the sale of land and mineral rights in colorado 
cash used in financing activities in primarily represented repayment of long term debt of million partially offset by million borrowings of revolving lines of credit 
we generated cash from financing activities of million in  comprised primarily of new borrowings of million of long term debt 
we used cash of million for the repayment of long term debt in we used cash of million for financing activities in  including million for the net repayment of long term debt and million for the net repayment of revolving debt 
dividends paid to westmoreland resources shareholder in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at our captive insurance subsidiary 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at our captive insurance subsidiary 
the cash at westmoreland mining is available to us through quarterly distributions  as described below 
the cash at westmoreland resources is available to us through dividends 
in addition  we had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of million at december  and million at december  the restricted cash at december  included million in westmoreland mining s debt service reserve and long term prepayment accounts 
the restricted cash at december  included million in westmoreland mining s debt service and long term prepayment accounts 
at december   our reclamation  workers compensation and postretirement medical cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of million  which amounts we have classified as non current assets 
in addition  we had reclamation deposits of million at december  and million at december   which we received from customers of the rosebud mine to pay for reclamation 
we also had million in interest bearing debt reserve accounts for the rova project at december  this cash is restricted as to its use and is classified as part of our investment in independent power projects 
in march  westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility 
this facility made million available to us in the add on facility permits westmoreland mining to undertake significant capital projects  principally at the rosebud and jewett mines  in the near term without adversely affecting cash available to westmoreland coal company 
the terms of the add on facility permit westmoreland mining to distribute this million to westmoreland coal company 
westmoreland mining distributed million in and million in to westmoreland coal company and expects to distribute the balance in the original term loan agreement  which financed our acquisition of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  continues to restrict westmoreland mining s ability to make distributions to westmoreland coal company from ongoing operations 
until westmoreland mining has fully paid the original acquisition debt  which is scheduled for december   westmoreland mining may only pay westmoreland coal company a management fee and distribute to westmoreland coal company of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow 
westmoreland mining is depositing the remaining into an account that will fund the million balloon payment due december  in when westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility  it also extended its revolving credit facility to and reduced the amount of the facility to million 
in december  westmoreland mining amended the revolving facility to increase the borrowing base to million and to extend its maturity to april to better align with our operating needs 
the increase includes the ability to issue letters of credit up to million which the company expects to use for reclamation bond collateral needs 
as of december   westmoreland mining had the entire million revolving facility available to borrow 
as of december   westmoreland coal company had million of its million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
liquidity outlook we describe certain liquidity comparisons in the liquidity outlook section below 
in addition  the following items are important 
reclamation our asset retirement obligations  as previously described under critical accounting estimates above  increased million during two of the more significant reasons for that increase were changes we made about the timing of required reclamation activities and the amount of work necessary 
these and other factors are disclosed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
jewett mine supply contract texas westmoreland and nrgt are party to a lignite supply agreement that expires in and that provides annual price redeterminations based on an equivalent cost of sprb coal used at the limestone station 
in january  the parties agreed to fix a price for the period through  with pricing thereafter to be determined pursuant to the underlying contract 
subsequent dramatic and unexpected increases in commodity costs  including costs for diesel fuel and steel  among other items  rendered the four year fixed price agreement uneconomic 
at the same time  market prices for sprb coal and associated rail rates also increased dramatically 
a new interim agreement was reached in september that enhanced the economics of the jewett mine over previous interim pricing arrangements  provides capital to support mine development  improves the mechanics for determining equivalent market pricing pursuant to the parties underlying contract after  and has returned texas westmoreland to a stable and satisfactory level of financial performance through the end of  when the price will be determined annually based on equivalent market value  or until the current long term supply agreement is modified further or restructured 
payments of million related to the first nine months of were recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter as related performance obligations were completed and payments were received from the customer 
combined benefit fund as previously reported in item legal proceedings and in note to the consolidated financial statements  on august  the united states district court for the district of maryland ruled that the cbf has been charging an excessive premium to coal operators since in our case  the total of the overpayment is approximately million 
the cbf trustees and the commissioner of social security have appealed the district court decision 
however  we believe that the decision will be upheld on appeal 
at that time  the company would recognize the million as income 
in the interim  the company accrued  but withheld  payment of its monthly premium for the fourth quarter  thereby benefiting cash flow in the amount of approximately million 
in early  the cbf resumed invoicing and the company paid the withheld payments 
however  as provided for by the court  the company is paying at the lower  adjusted rate going forward 
indian coal production tax credit in august the energy policy act of was enacted 
among other provisions  it contains a tax credit for the production of coal owned by indian tribes 
the credit is per ton beginning through and per ton from through  with both amounts escalating for inflation 
the credit may be used against regular corporate income tax for all years and against alternative minimum tax for the initial period 
the company s owned absaloka mine  which produces coal under a lease with the crow tribe  produces about million tons per year 
the savings will be shared with the crow tribe when they are realized 
significant anticipated variances between and we anticipate that the following events and developments  which we expect will occur in but which did not occur in  and the following events and developments  which we expect will not occur in but which did occur in  will affect our liquidity and our net income 
we discuss the prospective effects of the anticipated rova acquisition in more detail below 
tons sold increased in but are likely to remain comparable in coal revenues are expected to increase in due to contract renewals at higher prices 
however  overall cost of sales are also increasing due to inflation of commodity costs although not as much as revenues 
we anticipate that capital expenditures related to our mining activities will be comparable in and however  if capital expenditures at the jewett mine are included which are mostly reimbursed by the customer  the overall level of capital projects will be higher in than in we anticipate higher interest costs in because of increased use of our revolving credit lines and higher rates for the floating rate portion of westmoreland mining s debt 
our results for reflect a negative impact of increased prospective and retroactive personal property taxes at the rova project 
our pre tax income in was reduced by million for the accrual of our portion of the estimated cost 
in pre tax income should not suffer the cost of retroactive payments 
the lender to the rova project withheld funds in an amount equal to the total amount claimed by halifax county  which funds are normally available for distribution 
in early  most of the claim was resolved  and the county was paid from the withheld funds 
we expect higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in than in due to continued capital expenditures at our mines and an increase in the carrying value of our capitalized asset retirement costs 
in  we did not pay  but did accrue about million of the cbf s assessment which amount was paid in early thereby increasing cash costs in compared to our cash payments for this obligation are expected to decrease about million in as compared to  in part because we have now fully paid this assessment

our results reflect an million benefit which resulted from a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our federal nols 
during and  we have continued implementation of a corporate wide computer system to enhance our accounting  reporting and analysis capability 
the total investment at year end was approximately million 
we expect that the system will produce efficiencies and reduce costs associated with our current  separate systems 
in  we adopted a long term incentive plan to promote the successful implementation of our strategic plan and link the compensation of our key managers to the appreciation in the price of our common stock 
the board of directors compensation benefits committee granted awards under this long term incentive plan with a variable value in   and there was a reduction of expense of million for these awards in due to a reduction of the previous estimate of the obligations 
we are not able to predict the variable expense for these awards in new accounting rules require that we expense the value of stock options over their vesting periods  beginning in the first quarter of we have not determined the impact of this new requirement for new stock option awards 
the cost of expensing existing stock option grants will be minimal 
we accelerated vesting of all stock appreciation rights at the end of  resulting in an additional expense of million 
this decision will reduce future expense 
significant factors affecting our liquidity the matters discussed above focus on anticipated differences between and a number of non recurring events significantly influenced our results 
our operational performance  our financial results  and our liquidity may also be affected by all of the other matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including the legal proceedings discussed in item and the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
primarily because of our size and the multitude of issues related to our transition from an eastern underground producer of coal  to a western niche surface producer with significant reliance on independent power operations  we have been subject to the impact of many matters 
for all of the foregoing reasons  and while we anticipate that we will be profitable in  we cannot project our overall level of profitability 
financial implications of the rova acquisition on august   we signed an interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of lg e energy llc to acquire the interest in the rova project that we do not currently own 
lg e energy llc is now a subsidiary of e 
on us in november  dominion  the purchaser of the electricity generated by the rova project  asserted that the power purchase agreement gives it the right of first refusal with respect to lg e energy s interest 
dominion brought a legal action in virginia state court to assert their alleged right of first refusal 
this legal action has delayed the acquisition and made the ultimate outcome uncertain 
we are currently in negotiations with dominion and lg e in the hope that we can find a business solution that will resolve the pending dispute on terms that are acceptable to all parties 
the financial implications of the rova transaction depend significantly on when it is completed  how we choose to finance the transaction and the terms of any such financing 
in evaluating the terms of any proposed financing or any proposed agreement with dominion  we start with the existing contracts that were negotiated initially when the project was developed 
the principal contracts are two power purchase and operating contracts  pursuant to which the rova project sells electricity to dominion  and the agreements between the rova project and its lenders that financed the project s construction 
annual principal payments on the project s debt are projected to increase from million in  to approximately million in  and approximately million in annual principal payments are projected to fall sharply thereafter until the project s debt is fully paid in the revenues under the power purchase contracts were structured to permit the rova project to make these principal payments  but the project s revenues and expenses do not correspond perfectly  and under the project s existing arrangements  cash flow from the project after payment of principal and interest is expected to decline from through and then gradually increase through the coal supply agreements expire in and given today s market  the cost of coal is expected to increase 
we currently expect that completing the rova acquisition would increase our revenues  operating income  and net income over what we expect to receive from our existing ownership of the rova project  but the magnitude of the impact would depend in part on the factors described in the preceding paragraph 
if the rova acquisition is completed  we will subsequently consolidate their financial results in our consolidated financial statements 
we also expect that  through at least  the rova acquisition would increase our cash flow on an after tax basis over what we would have received from owning of the project  but the magnitude of the impact would again depend in part on the factors described above 
the alternative minimum tax also affects our return from the acquisition we anticipate that  if we acquire lg e s interest in the rova project  we would increase our alternative minimum taxable income 
coal markets and rail delivery issues significant events occurred during in the market for coal from the sprb of wyoming  the market benchmark for most of the company s sales 
first  the bnsf and union pacific up railroads experienced significant disruptions in their ability to carry coal out of the sprb on the so called joint line due to continued increases in demand for sprb coal and due to a major rail bed ballast rehabilitation project that caused limited capacity on that route 
the railroads rehabilitation work commenced in summer and will continue into these rail issues  combined with increasing demand for sprb coal  resulted in a marked increase in prices for sprb coal during the second half of and into prices for higher btu  ultra low sulfur sprb coal made further gains due to the rise in market prices for sulfur dioxide emission allowances  which are required by most coal fired power plants for compliance with regulations under the federal clean air act 
two thirds of the company s coal sales are delivered to its customers via conveyor belt  coal haulers  or highway trucks  while the remaining third is delivered via the bnsf 
the company s bnsf served mines  in montana and north dakota  are not directly affected by the joint line rehabilitation project 
rather  company mines have been affected indirectly  and to a much lesser extent than the sprb mines  because the bnsf has shifted some crews and locomotives to the sprb from time to time to help to alleviate the issues there 
unlike the sprb producers  the company did not lose significant budgeted production or sales in as a result of the on going rail issues 
market prices for sprb coal increased significantly from the first half of eighteen percent of the company s total sales tonnage was scheduled for price re determination on january   and most of these tons were generally benchmarked to sprb market prices with certain contractual and other restrictions 
these redeterminations resulted in a weighted average price increase for these tons of almost effective january  our ability to capture further market gains is restricted by the fact that almost all of our production is sold under long term contracts 
in addition  our mines are now producing at maximum in place capacity 
about of total company tons are currently scheduled to be open to market  via contract renewal  or market benchmarked price re determinations on january   on january   and  if certain customers elect not to invoke extension options  on january  plus an additional in and if the market based pricing mechanism under the jewett mine s contract with nrgt is preserved in the renegotiation of a long term supply agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
coal revenues increased from primarily as a result of a million increase in tons sold and because of higher prices  including a one time catch up payment of million received in the first quarter of for past cost increases for commodities 
as discussed in the liquidity outlook section of this form k under jewett mine supply contract  payments of million related to the first nine months of were recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter as performance obligations were completed and payments were received from the customer 
the increase in tons sold in came from new or extended sales contracts at the rosebud mine as well as increases at the jewett and absaloka mines 
cost of sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of increased tons produced  higher commodity prices for diesel fuel  electricity and explosives and higher stripping ratios 
very difficult mining conditions and unusually heavy rainfall increased costs at the beulah mine in the revenue includes the million colstrip arbitration award for the price reopener with the owners of colstrip units for coal shipped from july  to may  production taxes and royalties on those revenues totaled million 
costs at the jewett mine in included unplanned repairs to a primary dragline combined with significant weather related production interruptions 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods for actual results as reported and on a pro forma basis which excludes the impact of the colstrip arbitration award in year ended actual pro forma change change revenues thousands    volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands    change represents change between actual amounts and pro forma amounts 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily related to increased coal production  increased capital expenditures at the mines for both continued mine development and the replacement of mining equipment  and increased amortization of capitalized asset retirement costs 
independent power 
our equity in earnings from the independent power projects were million in both and for and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved capacity factors of in and in the slightly lower capacity factor in was the result of increased start up hours after scheduled outages 
in and  equity in earnings was reduced by and million  respectively  for costs associated with higher halifax county personal property tax assessments from prior years  which we unsuccessfully contested 
most of the contested claims were paid to halifax county in early in  the rova i and ii units had more scheduled outages for planned repairs that decreased the capacity factor  and they experienced more unscheduled outages for repairs than in we recognized  in equity earnings in  compared to  in from our interest in the fort lupton project 
costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for in  costs increased as a result of the million entech settlement plus related legal fees 
legal fees associated with the company s legal contingencies 
professional and consulting fees largely related to sarbanes oxley compliance activities 
compensation costs due to an increase in the number of employees required to pursue our growth initiatives 
higher costs at westmoreland energy llc for outside consulting 
however  as a result of the decline in the market price of the company s common stock in  the projected cost of our long term incentive performance unit plan declined and resulted in a benefit of million compared to an expense of million in heritage health benefit expenses  exclusive of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle associated with workers compensation  were million lower in compared to due primarily to three factors as follows costs for pneumoconiosis black lung benefits were million in  but primarily because of reduced actuarial projections a credit of million was recorded in workers compensation expense was million less than in with the conclusion of the case audits discussed below 
costs for the cbf were million less than in as a result of factors discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued workers compensation expense was significantly higher in and relative to because we conducted and completed case audits of all active claims over the past two years  and because we are using more current mortality tables for those claims 
cash payments  however  have declined over the past three years because indemnity payments for a majority of the beneficiaries have been satisfied 
we incurred cash costs of million for workers compensation during compared to million in we incurred cash costs of million for postretirement medical costs during compared to million in we expect to incur approximately million for these costs in interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
another million was incurred and capitalized as acquisition costs in interest associated with the increased debt outstanding from the westmoreland mining add on facility and borrowing using the company s revolving credit facilities was offset by the lower interest expense on the acquisition financing obtained during as principal payments are made 
interest income decreased in in spite of larger balances in our restricted cash and surety bond collateral accounts because included million in interest relating to the colstrip units arbitration decision 
both years include amortization of debt financing costs 
when taxable income is generated  the deferred tax asset relating to the company s net operating loss carryforwards is reduced and a deferred tax expense non cash is recognized although no regular federal income taxes are paid 
current income tax expense in both and relate to obligations for state income taxes  including the million expense recorded for tax assessments for prior years in north carolina and federal alternative minimum tax 
during  the deferred tax benefit of million includes an million benefit caused by a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from an increase in the amount of federal nols carryforwards we expect to utilize before their expiration 
results of operations for the quarter ending december  were affected by several significant adjustments as follows a million credit in heritage health benefit expenses for black lung benefits 
workers compensation expense of million as the result of actuarial changes and updated estimates 
revenue totaling million for coal shipped earlier in the year for which the related performance obligations weren t completed until the fourth quarter 
a significant tax benefit as the result of adjusting the valuation allowance related to our federal nols 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
we sold about million more tons of coal in than we did in the increase in tons sold in came from new or extended sales contracts at the rosebud and absaloka mines 
revenues increased at a greater rate primarily because  in  we received an arbitration award increasing the contract price for tons sold to colstrip units from our rosebud mine retroactive to july this resulted in the recognition in of additional revenue of million and related production taxes and royalties of million 
the increased price will continue through the expiration of the contract with colstrip units in in spite of the additional margin from this retroactive price increase  costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in compared to in this was mostly a result of weather related interruptions in at the jewett mine and increased costs for diesel fuel and electricity used at our mines 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in  primarily because we increased capital expenditures at the mines for both continued mine development and the replacement of mining equipment and because increased depreciation resulted from the increase in production levels 
there was also higher amortization due to an increase in capitalized asset retirement costs 
independent power 
our equity in earnings from independent power operations decreased to million in from million in the decrease was attributable to a million charge for halifax county personal property tax assessments from prior years  and costs associated with a major five year scheduled maintenance outage 
during and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
we also recognized  in equity in earnings in from our interest in the fort lupton project compared to  in costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in contributing to the decrease were lower expenses for both severance and long term incentive compensation plans  a decrease in health care costs for active employees and decreased legal fees associated with coal contract negotiations and other litigation 
long term incentive compensation decreased to million in from million in this is a non cash expense until it is paid 
payments are currently being made over a five year period following maturity 
the compensation and benefits committee elected to pay a portion of the payments in shares of common stock 
future exercises of stock appreciation rights will be settled in common stock 
heritage health benefit expenses increased to million in compared to million in several factors impacted these costs these expenses included a million credit in for settlement of the umwa pension plan  which was partially offset by a million retroactive premium assessed by the combined fund 
in  we increased our estimate of outstanding workers compensation costs by million based upon increased claims experience and revised actuarial projections 
interest expense was million in and million in interest associated with the larger amount of outstanding debt as a result of westmoreland mining s add on facility and increased use of westmoreland mining s revolver facility during the year was offset by lower interest payments due to the pay down of the acquisition financing obtained in interest income increased in because of larger restricted cash and surety bond collateral balances and interest of million associated with the arbitration decision relating to colstrip units new accounting pronouncements please refer to the new accounting pronouncements discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company  through its subsidiaries wri and wml  produces and sells coal to third parties from coal mining operations in montana  texas and north dakota and through its subsidiary  wellc  produces and sells electricity and steam to third parties from its independent power projects located in north carolina and colorado 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts serve to minimize the company s exposure to revenue volatility due to changes in commodity prices although some of the company s contracts are adjusted periodically based upon market prices 
however  the company is subject to variable costs for commodities it consumes such as diesel fuel  electricity and steel 
during  the company was not party to any derivative contracts 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
long term debt obligations have both fixed and variable interest rates  and the company s revolving line of credit has a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  based on the balances outstanding as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
the company s heritage health benefit costs are also impacted by interest rate changes because its pension  pneumoconiosis and post retirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
