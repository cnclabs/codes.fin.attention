item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general overview our products and services are marketed in at least states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be countercyclical to each other 
demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the united states and global economy and economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the united states and global economy 
as a result  we may experience changes in demand within particular markets  segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers respective markets 
during  our performance was impacted negatively by the economic downturn  particularly the downturn in domestic manufacturing 
all of our increase in sales and gross profit for compared to was due to increased sales of products for offshore energy production 
our employee headcount decreased by over ten percent during as we worked to bring our cost structure in line with our sales 
during the economy improved 
our employee headcount decreased by approximately during the majority of the sales increase came from increased sales of products for offshore energy production and general manufacturing 
during the general economy and the oil and gas exploration and production business continued to improve 
our employee headcount increased by as a result of two acquisitions and hiring additional personnel to support increased sales 
the majority of the sales increase came from a broad based increase in sales of pumps  bearings  safety products and mill supplies to customers engaged in oilfield service  oil and gas production  mining  electricity generation and petrochemical processing 
sales by the two businesses acquired in accounted for millio n of the million sales increase 
our sales growth strategy in recent years has focused on internal growth 
key elements of our sales strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships by cross selling new products  expanding product offerings to new and existing customers  and increasing business to business solutions using system agreements and smartsource sm solutions for our integrated supply customers 
we will continue to review opportunities to grow through the acquisition of distributors and other businesses that would expand our geographic breadth and or add additional products and services 
our results will depend on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and  to the extent we complete any acquisitions  our ability to integrate such acquisitions effectively 
our strategies to increase productivity include consolidated purchasing programs  centralizing product distribution centers  centralizing certain customer service and inside sales functions  converting selected locations from full warehouse and customer service operations to dxp service centers  and using information technology to increase employee productivity 
results of operations years ended december  in millions  except percentages sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense other income and minority interest income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income per share basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for increased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment increased million  or primarily due to a broad based increase in sales of pumps  bearings  safety products and mill supplies to companies engaged in oilfield service  oil and gas production  mining  electricity generation and petrochemical processing 
the sales increases appear to be at least partially the result of an improved economy and high energy prices 
sales by the two businesses acquired in accounted for million of the sales increase 
excluding sales of the acquired businesses  sales for the mro segment increased 
sales for the electrical contractor segment were the same at million for and gross profit 
gross profit for increased compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by approximately for  when compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment increased to in from in this increase can be primarily attributed to increased margins on pump related equipment sold by the mro segment 
the period included certain large sales of products for offshore energy production with lower than average margins 
in we replaced those sales with smaller  higher margin sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment increased to for  up from in this increase resulted from the continued effort to focus on selling higher margin specialty electrical products and to be selective on selling lower margin commodity type electrical products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for increased by approximately million  or  when compared to the increase is primarily attributed to increased salaries  incentive compensation  employee benefits  payroll related expenses and costs associated with two hurricanes in selling  general and administrative expense associated with the two businesses acquired in accounted for million of the increase 
salaries have increased partially as a result of hiring more sales related personnel for the purpose of increasing sales 
incentive compensation has increased as a result of increased gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  the expense increased by approximately to from for this increase is primarily the result of increased incentive compensation 
the majority of our employees receive incentive compensation which is based upon gross profit 
selling  general and administrativ e expense as a percentage of gross profit declined in compared to operating income 
operating income for increased by approximately million  or  when compared to this increase was the result of an increase in operating income for the mro segment and a increase in operating income for the electrical contractor segment 
operating income for the mro segment increased as a result of increased gross profit  partially offset by increased selling  general  and administrative expense 
operating income for the electrical contractor segment increased as a result of selling  general and administrative costs decreasing and gross profit increasing 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased by million to million from million for this increase resulted from the combination of increased debt to fund acquisitions and an approximate basis point increase in prime and libor market interest rates for compared to the effect of the increase in market interest rates was partially offset by the lower margins on our new credit facility 
income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million representing the future tax benefits of certain accruals not currently deductible 
we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized as these reserves are recovered and reduce future taxable income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for increased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment increased million  or primarily due to increased sales of products for offshore energy production and general manufacturing 
sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased by million  or  when compared to this decline resulted from an effort to focus on sales of higher margin specialty electrical products and to be selective on sales of lower margin commodity type electrical products 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately for  when compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment decreased to for  from in this decrease can be attributed to increased costs incurred due to leaks discovered during pressure testing of a recently introduced type of fiberglass pipe installed on several offshore energy production platforms and the abnormal frequency and magnitude of recent vendor price increases which made it difficult to immediately pass through the increases to our customers 
we are working to pass these increases to our customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment increased to for  from in this increase resulted from increased sales of higher margin specialty type electrical products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for was approximately the same as for as a percentage of revenue  the expense decreased by approximately to from for this decrease is attributable to an increase in productivity 
operating income 
operating income for increased when compared to operating income for the mro segment increased as a result of gross profit increasing more than selling  general and administrative expense increased 
operating income for the electrical contractor segment increased when compared to the improved operating income for the electrical contractor segment is the result of reduced selling  general and administrative expense combined with increased gross profit from increased sales of higher margin specialty type electrical products 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by  to million from million during this decline results from a lower average debt balance for when compared to liquidity and capital resources general overview as a distributor of mro products and electrical contractor products  we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivable 
additional cash is required for capital items such as information technology and warehouse equipment 
we also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt 
we used approximately million of cash in operating activities in as compared to million in cash provided during this change between the two years was primarily attributable to the million increase in accounts receivable in compared to the million decline in the increase in accounts receivable in resulted from the million increase in sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we also used million of cash to pay employee taxes related to the cashless exercise of stock options 
this amount was partially offset by the million after tax benefit of the tax deduction we received due to the exercise of stock options 
the tax deduction allowed us to cease making federal tax payments for and will reduce federal tax payments in we purchased approximately million of capital assets during compared to million for capital expenditures during were related primarily to computer equipment  computer software  inventory handling equipment  and building improvements 
the capital expenditures related primarily to an airplane and computer equipment 
we purchased the airplane to increase our efficiency in marketing to a nationwide customer base and to manage our numerous remote locations 
capital expenditures for are expected to be between the amounts for and at december   our long term debt was million compared to total capitalization long term debt plus shareholders equity of million 
approximately million of this outstanding debt bears interest at various floating rates 
therefore  as an example  a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
our normal trade terms require payment within days of invoice date 
in response to competition and customer demands we will offer extended terms to selected customers with good credit history 
customers that are financially strong tend to request extended terms more often than customers that are not financially strong 
many of our customers  including companies listed in the fortune  do not pay us within stated terms for a variety of reasons  including a general business philosophy to pay vendors as late as possible 
we generally collect the amounts due from these large  slow paying customers 
during  the amount available to be borrowed under our credit facility increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase in availability during resulted from an increase in the collateral value of inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by a million increase in the amount borrowed under our lines of credit 
the increased borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions 
management believes that the liquidity of our balance sheet at december   provides us with the ability to meet our working capital needs  scheduled principal payments  capital expenditures and series b preferred stock dividend payments during credit facility on august   we entered into a new credit facility new credit facility which replaced the previous credit facility old credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii million  and matures july  the new credit facility is secured by receivables  inventory and intangibles 
the new credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured quarterly and require that we maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios 
the new credit facility allows us to borrow at libor plus a margin ranging from to or prime minus a margin of to 
at december   the libor based rate was libor plus basis points 
at december   the prime based rate was prime minus basis points 
the libor and prime based rates under the new credit facility are generally basis points and basis points lower  respectively  than those assessed under the old credit facility 
at december   million was borrowed at an interest rate of under the libor option and million was borrowed at an interest rate of under the prime option 
commitment fees of 
percent per annum are payable on the portion of the new credit facility capacity not in use for borrowings at any given time 
this fee is basis points lower than the same fee under the old credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in addition to the million of cash at december   we had million available for borrowings under the new credit facility at december  the new credit facility s principal financial covenants include fixed charge coverage ratio the new credit facility requires that the fixed charge coverage ratio be not less than to as of each fiscal quarter end  determined on a rolling four quarters basis  with fixed charge coverage ratio defined as the aggregate of net profit after taxes plus depreciation expense  amortization expense  and cash capital contributions minus dividends and distributions divided by the aggregate of the current maturity of long term debt and capitalized lease payments 
debt to credit facility adjusted ebitda the new credit facility requires that the company s ratio of total funded debt to credit facility adjusted ebitda  determined on a rolling four quarters basis  not exceed to as of each quarter end 
total funded debt is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as the sum of all obligations for borrowed money excluding subordinated debt plus all capital lease obligations 
credit facility adjusted ebitda is defined under the credit facility for financial covenant purposes as net profit before tax  plus interest expense net of capitalized interest expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense  inclusive of acquisitions 
borrowings december  increase decrease in thousands current portion of long term debt long term debt  less current portion total long term debt amount available represents amount available to be borrowed at the indicated date under the credit facility 
the funds obtained from the increase in long term debt were primarily used to acquire two businesses 
the million increase in the amount available is primarily a result of an increase in the collateral value of inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by increased borrowings under the line of credit 
performance metrics december  increase decrease days of sales outstanding in days inventory turns results for businesses acquired in were annualized to compute these performance metrics 
accounts receivable days of sales outstanding were at december  compared to days at december  the increase resulted primarily from the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of annualized inventory turns were times at december  compared to times at december  the decline in inventory turns resulted from decisions made by inventory management to increase inventory to support increased sales 
funding commitments we believe our cash generated from operations and available under our new credit facility will meet our normal working capital needs during the next twelve months 
however  we may require additional debt or equity financing to fund potential acquisitions 
such additional financings may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
in connection with any such financing  we may issue securities that substantially dilute the interests of our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on attractive terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion operating lease obligations estimated interest payments total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustment 
assumes interest rates in effect at december  assumes debt is paid on maturity date and not replaced 
does not include interest on the revolving line of credit as borrowings under this facility fluctuate 
the amounts of interest incurred for borrowings under the revolving lines of credit were   and  for  and  respectively 
management anticipates an increased level of interest payments on the new credit facility in as a result of increased interest rates and debt levels 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe s  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
indemnification in the ordinary course of business  dxp enters into contractual arrangements under which dxp may agree to indemnify customers from any losses incurred relating to the services we perform 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnities have been immaterial 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying financial statements relate to reserves for accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuations  income taxes and self insured medical claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s subjective or complex judgments 
these policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors of dxp 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
also  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when an agreement is in place  price is fixed  title for product passes to the customer or services have been provided  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts 
write offs could be materially different from the reserve provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced at lower of cost or market  cost being determined using both the first in  first out fifo and the last in  first out lifo method 
reserves are provided against inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon the aging of the inventory and market trends 
actual obsolescence could be materially different from the reserve if economic conditions or market trends change significantly 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million as of december  we believe it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
self insured medical claims we accrue for the estimated outstanding balance of unpaid medical claims for our employees and their dependents 
the accrual is adjusted monthly based on recent claims experience 
the actual claims could deviate from recent claims experience and be materially different from the reserve 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation we do not believe the effects of inflation have any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we attempt to minimize inflationary trends by passing manufacturer price increases on to the customer whenever practicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk results primarily from volatility in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
using floating interest rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  the table below provides information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement
