table of contents asset quality asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  our underwriting and ongoing management of our investment portfolio 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  we also use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio 
we use the following to investment rating scale investment rating summary description capital gain expected or realized full return of principal and interest or dividend expected with customer performing in accordance with plan full return of principal and interest or dividend expected but customer requires closer monitoring some loss of interest or dividend expected but still expecting an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment expected which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment the following table shows the distribution of our investments on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and dollars in millions december  december  investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio a a a of this amount  million at december  and million at december  relate to debt instruments in companies for which we have already realized a gain through the sale of equity instruments 
while these debt instruments are still outstanding  all of the related equity instruments have already been sold at a gain and  therefore  we do not expect any further realized gain 
we monitor loan concentrations in our portfolio  both on an individual investment basis and on an industry basis  to manage overall portfolio performance due to specific customer issues or specific industry issues 
changes in investment ratings occur due to origination activity  migration within the portfolio and payoff activity

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following table shows the components of our net operating income for the years ended december   and year ended december  change percentage change dollars in millions operating income interest and dividend income loan fees total interest and dividend income fees and other income total operating income operating expenses interest expense employee compensation salaries and benefits long term incentive compensation total employee compensation general and administrative expense total operating expenses net operating income net investment gains net income total operating income total operating income includes interest and dividend income  loan fees and fees and other income 
the level of interest income  which includes interest paid in cash and in kind  is directly related to the balance of the interest bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted average yield 
the weighted average yield varies from period to period based on the current stated interest rate on interest bearing investments and the amounts of loans for which interest is not accruing 
dividend income results from dividends earned on our yielding equity investments 
dividend income will vary from period to period depending upon the level of yield on our equity investments and the amount of yielding equities outstanding  as well as the value of the underlying securities 

table of contents the increase in interest and dividend income for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is due to growth in average loans  which had an impact of million  an increase in libor  which had an impact of million and an increase in dividend income  which had an impact of million  primarily attributable to our preferred stock of broadview networks holdings  inc these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the spread to libor in our loan portfolio  which had an impact of million 
the majority of the decrease in the spread to libor is related to holding fixed rate loans and loans with libor floors in a rising interest rate environment  as well as fluctuations due to payoff and origination activity 
the total yield on our total investment portfolio  at cost  for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our investments in bridgecom holdings  inc and broadview accounted for approximately million  or  of our total operating income 
our operating income related to bridgecom and broadview related to interest and dividends on our loan and equity investments in these entities 
our preferred stock investment in broadview  which had a fair value of million as of december   entitles us to a preferred claim of approximately million plus accrued dividends  which accumulate at an annual rate of on our preferred claim 
we currently expect that our broadview investment will continue to comprise a significant component of our operating income 
in future periods  our ability to record income related to the accumulating dividends on our preferred securities will be dependent upon the performance and value of broadview 
loan fees for the years ended december  and  included fees relating to the following dollars in millions amortizing and other fee income fee accelerations total loan fees loan fees include origination fees on loans that are capitalized and amortized into interest income over the life of the loan 
when repayments or restructurings with other than minor modifications occur  we will accelerate the recognition into loan fee income of previously unamortized loan origination fees 
these accelerations have the effect of increasing current period income and reducing future amortizable income 
because these repayments and restructurings may vary from period to period  the amount of loan origination fees that are recognized as interest income may also vary from period to period 
the decrease in amortizing fee income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is related primarily to the volume of fee accelerations in and a decrease in our average origination fees on new loans 
fees and other income primarily include fees related to advisory and management services  prepayment fees  research revenues  bank interest and other income 
fees and other income are generally related to specific transactions or services and therefore may vary from period to period depending on the level and types of services provided 
the decrease in fees and other income of million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to million of management fees earned in from one of our control investments  bridgecom holdings  inc  prior to its merger with broadview  versus none earned during  and a decrease in other income of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in advisory fees of million  prepayment fees of million  research revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary kagan research  llc of million  and bank interest income of million 
the increase in bank interest income is due to higher cash balances  primarily in our cash  securitization accounts  due to higher principal and interest payments on loans held as collateral for our securitization facilities 
cash from principal and interest payments that occur in our securitization facilities are accumulated in trust accounts until monthly or quarterly disbursements are made from trust accounts 
these balances are reflected as cash  securitization accounts on the balance sheet 
the portion of payments that represent principal payments are primarily used to repay debt 

table of contents total operating expenses operating expenses include interest  employee compensation and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in interest expense during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to an increase of million due to increases in libor  an increase of million due to the spread to libor  and an increase of million due to higher average borrowings 
employee compensation includes base salaries and benefits  variable annual incentive compensation  and long term incentive compensation 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased staffing  which is part of an ongoing effort to expand our infrastructure in order to support our plans for future growth 
long term incentive compensation expense is made up of non cash amortization of restricted stock awards granted in and dividends on performance based restricted shares and shares securing employee loans 
long term incentive compensation totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  our compensation committee waived the performance based forfeiture restrictions and modified the time based forfeiture provisions that were applicable to restricted stock of certain of our executive officers which resulted in an expense of million 
during the third quarter of  the performance based forfeiture restrictions and time based forfeiture provisions that were applicable to restricted stock of certain non executive officers lapsed which resulted in a million increase in long term incentive compensation expense and a million increase in salaries and benefits expense

reversals of unrealized appreciation and depreciation occur when a gain or loss becomes realized 
the net realized gains for the year ended december  were primarily attributable to a million realized gain on the sale of our creatas equity investment  partially offset by a million realized loss on the sale of our investment in umac  inc the reversal of unrealized appreciation on the creatas investment totaled million  and the reversal of unrealized depreciation on the umac investment totaled million 
during  our investment with the largest unrealized depreciation was crystal media network  llc 
certain events occurred at crystal media during that caused us to record unrealized losses on our equity investment of approximately million 
these unrealized losses  along with unrealized losses recorded on this investment prior to  have reduced our estimated fair value of our equity investment in crystal media to approximately million  which is approximately million less than our cost basis in this investment

the increase in dividend income was primarily related to dividends on preferred stock of one of our control investments  bridgecom holdings  inc during the year ended december   our bridgecom investment accounted for approximately of our total operating income 
the decrease in interest income on loans was due to a lower average spread to libor on the loan portfolio  which had an impact of million  partially offset by asset growth  which had an impact of million  and an increase in libor during the year ended  which had an impact of million 
the lower spread to libor is partly due to a change in investment mix  which includes an increase in the proportion of our investment portfolio that is in diversified sectors 
these investments generally bare lower risk and yield lower interest rates  which accounted for approximately million of the change in spread 
we have originated these investments to enhance our diversification  to reduce overall portfolio risk and to achieve better execution on our debt financing 
further  because libor increased during the year ended december   the spread to libor on fixed rate loans and loans with libor floors decreased 
this accounted for approximately million of the change in spread

we also had million of restricted cash as of december  we primarily invest cash on hand in interest bearing deposit accounts 
cash  securitization accounts include payments received on securitized loans  which are held in designated bank accounts until monthly or quarterly disbursements are made from the securitization trusts 
we are required to use a portion of these amounts to pay interest expense  reduce borrowings  or pay other amounts in accordance with the related securitization agreements 
borrowed funds that have not yet been invested may negatively impact our earnings until they are invested since the interest we pay on borrowings typically exceeds the rate of return that we are able to earn on temporary cash investments 
our objective is to maintain sufficient cash on hand to cover current funding requirements and operational needs 
for  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  a decrease of million from the prior year s amount 
this decrease was due primarily to an increase in the amount of accrued payment in kind interest and dividend income and an increase in cash used by working capital activities partially offset by an increase in net operating income 
cash used by investing activities totaled million compared with million in this increase is the result of higher portfolio growth in cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of lower net borrowings and higher distributions partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our cash on hand and cash generated from operations  including the portion of the cash in securitization accounts that will be released to us  to be adequate to meet our cash needs at our current level of operations 
in order to fund new originations  we intend to use cash on hand  advances under our borrowing facilities and equity financings 
our secured borrowing facilities generally contain collateral requirements  including  but not limited to  asset mix  minimum diversity and rating and limitations on loan size 
these limitations limit our ability to fund certain new originations with advances under such facilities  in which case we fund originations using unsecured debt or equity financings

also during  we amended certain of our existing credit agreements  including our million unsecured revolver with bayerische hypo und vereinsbank  ag  new york branch and our million warehouse credit facility with suntrust bank 
the overall capacity  revolving capacity and collateral requirements of these new and amended financings allow for greater funding flexibility  which we believe will help us to leverage our assets more consistently

distributions we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders of substantially all of our income 
we may make deemed distributions to our stockholders of certain net capital gains 
as a business development company that has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company  we generally are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and of any ordinary pre ric built in gains that we recognize and distribute actually or on a deemed basis at least of our income both ordinary income and net capital gains to avoid an excise tax 

table of contents through december   we have made distributions in excess of our earnings of approximately million 
in addition  through december   we have net unrealized depreciation on our investments of million 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the investment company act of and due to provisions in our credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
the following table summarizes our distributions declared since january  date declared record date payment date amount february  march  april  october  november  january  july  august  october  april  may  july  february  march  april  october  november  january  july  august  october  april  may  july  march  april  april  to date  we have declared distributions totaling per share 
the table below shows the detail of our distributions for the years ended december  and ordinary income a capital gains a return of capital b total reported on tax form div a for  and  ordinary income is reported on form div as either qualified or non qualified and capital gains are reported on form div in various sub categories which have differing tax treatments to shareholders 
those subcategories have not been shown here 
b return of capital refers to those amounts reported as nontaxable distributions on form div 
each year a statement on form div identifying the source of the distributions ie  paid from ordinary income  paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities  and or a return of paid in capital surplus which is a nontaxable distribution is mailed to our stockholders 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to our stockholders 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income recognition interest on commercial loans is recognized when earned and is computed by methods that generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding 
we monitor individual customer s financial trends in order to assess the recoverability of interest with respect to each customer 
we closely monitor the status and performance of each individual investment 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
paid in kind interest we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual paid in kind pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term 
we will cease accruing pik if we do not expect the customer to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
in certain cases  a customer makes principal payments on its loan prior to making payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a customer s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that customer may stay the same or decrease 
pik loans represented million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  pik related activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  dollars in millions beginning pik loan balance pik interest earned during the period principal payments on pik loans pik loans converted to other securities realized loss ending pik loan balance as noted above  in certain cases  a customer may make principal payments on its loan that are contractually applied first to the non pik loan balance instead of the pik loan balance 
if all principal payments from these customers had been applied first to any pik loan balance outstanding at the time of the payment  and any remainder applied to the non pik loan balance  an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million and an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million 
if the payments had been applied against the pik balance  the balance at december  and would have been million and million  respectively 
as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding have an investment rating of or better and as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding had an investment rating of or better 
the net increase in loan balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents dividends certain of our equity investments have stated accruing dividend rates 
we accrue dividends on our equity investments as they are earned to the extent there is sufficient value to support the ultimate payment of those dividends 
year ended december  in millions beginning accrued dividend balance dividend income earned during the period payment of previously accrued dividends accrued dividends converted to other securities ending accrued dividend balance loan origination fees loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
in certain loan arrangements  warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees 
the borrowers granting these interests are typically non publicly traded companies 
we record the financial instruments received at fair value as determined by our board of directors 
fair values are determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share considering any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
changes in these values are recorded through our statement of operations 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
we had million and million of unearned income as of december  and december   respectively 
unearned income activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in millions cash received equity interest and future receivables total cash received equity interest and future receivables total beginning unearned income balance additional fees unearned income recognized unearned fees applied against loan balance a ending unearned income balance a when a loan is paid off at an amount below our cost basis  we apply any fees received that have not been recognized as income against the outstanding loan amount to reduce the cost basis  which has the effect of reducing any realized loss 
other fees in certain investment transactions  we may perform consulting or advisory services 
for services that are separately identifiable and external evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned which is generally when the investment transaction closes 

table of contents valuation of investments value  as defined in section a of the investment company act of  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
at december   approximately of our total assets represented investments of which approximately are valued at fair value and approximately are valued at market value based on readily ascertainable public market quotes at december  because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment 
unlike banks  we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we must determine the fair value of each individual investment on a quarterly basis and record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has decreased in value  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  where appropriate  we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our investment has also appreciated in value 
as a business development company  we invest primarily in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
the structure of each debt and equity security is specifically negotiated to enable us to protect our investment and maximize our returns 
we generally include many terms governing interest rate  repayment terms  prepayment penalties  financial covenants  operating covenants  ownership and corporate governance parameters  dilution parameters  liquidation preferences  voting rights  and put or call rights 
in many cases  our loan agreements also allow for increases in the spread to the base index rate if the financial or operational performance of the customer deteriorates or shows negative variances from the customer s business plan and  in some cases  allow for decreases in the spread if financial or operational performance improves or exceeds the customer s plan 
our investments are generally subject to some restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
because of the type of investments that we make and the nature of our business  our valuation process requires an analysis of various factors 
our fair value methodology includes the examination of  among other things  the underlying investment performance  financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation 
each debt and equity investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks  and  where appropriate  the value is assigned a discount reflecting the illiquid nature of the investment and or our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering  or subsequent debt or equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private debt or equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the date of the relevant period end 
however  restricted or thinly traded public securities may be valued at discounts from the public market value due to the restrictions on sale 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
for restricted common stock issued to employees for whom no performance based criteria apply  compensation expense  equal to the value of the shares at the later of the grant date or the date at which all return based forfeiture provisions lapsed or were removed  is recorded over the term of the forfeiture provisions 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our employee stock plans 

table of contents securitization transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to bankruptcy remote special purpose entities for use in securitization transactions 
these on balance sheet securitization transactions comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the total face amount of the outstanding loans and equity investments assumed by third parties equaling million at december  and million at december  recent developments effective january   we deconsolidated our investment in kagan research llc and will therefore account for this investment as a portfolio company 
prior to january   kagan was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary 
as of january   kagan no longer qualifies to be a consolidated subsidiary 
we currently do not expect the deconsolidation of kagan to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
is effective beginning with the first interim period of the fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r effective january  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and expect that adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our employee stock plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from the changes in the level of interest rates 
our net interest income is affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor  prime rates and commercial paper rates 
approximately of our loan portfolio  at cost  bears interest at a spread to libor  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate or at a spread to a prime rate 
approximately of our loan portfolio  at cost  has a libor floor  at various levels 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk 
we have interest rate risk exposure mainly from the portion of the commercial loan portfolio funded using stockholders equity 
our board of directors assesses interest rate risk and we manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis 
the following table shows a comparison of the interest rate base for our interest bearing cash  outstanding commercial loans and our outstanding borrowings at december  and december  december  dollars in millions interest bearing cash and commercial loans borrowings interest bearing cash and commercial loans borrowings repurchase agreement rate money market rate prime rate day libor day libor day libor day libor commercial paper rate fixed rate total 
table of contents based on our december  balance sheet  the following table shows the impact to net income of base rate changes in interest rates assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure 
dollars in millions basis point change interest income interest expense net income currently  we do not engage in hedging activities because we have determined that the cost of hedging the risks associated with interest rate changes outweighs the risk reduction benefit 
we monitor this strategy on an ongoing basis and may engage in certain hedging activities in the future as we deem appropriate
