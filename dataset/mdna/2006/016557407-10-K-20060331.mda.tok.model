these signs of improvement continued through the second quarter of management believes that in the third quarter of customers began reducing their purchasing in response to increased inventory levels at the customer base and a slight slowdown in end markets 
at the end of the second quarter of industry conditions softened and remained relatively soft through the first quarter of industry conditions improved slightly throughout the balance of we expect that the slightly improved conditions may continue throughout our backlog of customer orders  which grew from million at december  to million at june   began to trend downward during the third quarter of and was million at december  by december   our backlog increased significantly to million 
in  the global semiconductor market was billion compared to billion for  representing a increase

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  a postretirement benefit obligation and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgement  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for the company is typically recognized at time of shipment as the company does not have any performance obligations beyond shipment to its customers 
prices for purchases are negotiated by the company with its suppliers 
prices for sales are negotiated by the company with its customers 
customers are typically required to pay the company for sales within days of shipment to the customer 
the company offers rebates to certain customers based on the volume of products purchased 
the company follows emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  accordingly  any rebate obligations are deducted from revenues 
in addition  while substantially all of the company s sales are final  a very limited number of customers have contractual rights to return product based upon a percentage of their purchases 
furthermore  from time to time as a result of special and or extenuating circumstances  a very small amount of sales are returned 
as a result  the company reserves for returns as a deduction against revenues 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon historical experience and is reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
most of the company s product sales come from products that it purchases from a supplier and holds in inventory 
a portion of the company s business is drop shipments which involve shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in all transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment terms by the company to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer to the company  and product returns from the customer to the company  and the company has the risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes revenue on a drop shipment when the company is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
the company also maintains consignment inventory 
under consignment programs product is shipped to a consignee customer so that such product is available for the consignee s use when they are required 
the consignee may or may not be obligated to purchase the consigned inventory and in some instances maintains a right to return unused product that is shipped under the consignment inventory program 
revenue is not recognized from products shipped on consignment until notification is received from the company s consignee customer that the customer has accepted title of and consumed the inventory that was shipped initially on consignment 
the product shipped on consignment in which title has not been accepted by the customer is included in the company s inventories and is not included in revenue 
the company s accounts receivable are due from a broad range of customers 
the company extends credit based on ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition and payment history 
accounts receivable are generally due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is a deterioration of our customers creditworthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  would have decreased earnings by approximately  inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions as well as the company s distribution agreements with its suppliers  which generally provide for price protection and obsolescence credits  inventories are written down to market value 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and obsolescence credits  estimates  based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions  are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
if our assumptions about future demand change  and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
for example  a increase in the inventory reserve at december  would have decreased earnings by approximately  deferred tax assets are recorded based on the company s projected future taxable income and the resulting utilization of the deferred tax assets 
to the extent that the company would not be able to realize in the future all or part of its deferred tax assets  which aggregated million at december   an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be necessary and charged to income 
the company calculates a postretirement benefit obligation using actuarial life expectancy tables and an assumed discount rate 
if the assumptions used in this calculation change  an adjustment to the postretirement benefit obligation may be required 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product  intellectual property  environmental and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we evaluate the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

the company believes that currency fluctuations could adversely impact its financial results in the future if the company increases transactions in foreign currencies and or adds offshore infrastructure which is paid for in foreign currencies 
the company believes that currency fluctuations could have adverse effects on its business if the impact from those currency fluctuations makes components manufactured abroad too expensive  causes limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or causes the company s offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
in certain prior years  the company believes that currency fluctuations have had such adverse effects 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations could result in increasing the cost of goods of the company or reducing its net sales as purchase and sale prices for the company s goods fixed in foreign currency may result in the cost of goods in us dollars being greater when paid or net sales in us dollars on payment for goods being less when received than anticipated when the price payable or to be received in foreign currency is originally fixed
