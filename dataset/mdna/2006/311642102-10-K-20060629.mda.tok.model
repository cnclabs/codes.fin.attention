item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this document 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  market and support portable  software driven  d measurement systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing  industrial  building construction and forensic applications 
the company s faro arm  faro scan arm and faro gage articulated measuring devices  the faro laser tracker  and their companion cam software  provide for computer aided design cad based inspection and or factory level statistical process control 
together  these products integrate the measurement  quality inspection  and reverse engineering functions with cad software to improve productivity  enhance product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process 
the company uses the acronym cam for this process  which stands for computer aided manufacturing measurement 
the company s digital template articulated measuring device and its related software are used to measure the shape of existing counter tops and other structures in residential or commercial buildings to provide the data required to manufacture replacement countertops or other structures 
the digital template reduces the time required to measure these existing products and to provide the data to manufacturing machines to create the replacement structures  compared to traditional techniques 
in march the company acquired iqvolution ag  a german designer  developer and manufacturer of a portable laser based device for measuring the detailed composition of factories  oil refineries and other structures 
this device and its related software  which the company sells under the product name laser scanner ls also has forensic applications such as capturing detailed d crime scene information 
as of june  the company s products have been purchased by approximately  customers worldwide  ranging from small machine shops to such large manufacturing and industrial companies as audi  bell helicopter  boeing  british aerospace  caterpillar  daimler chrysler  general electric  general motors  honda  johnson controls  komatsu dresser  lockheed martin  nissan  siemens and volkswagen  among many others 
we continue to pursue international markets 
we established sales offices in france and germany in  great britain in  japan and spain in  italy in  and china in we opened sales offices in south korea and india in we established sales offices in poland  netherlands  malaysia  vietnam  and singapore in and added a new regional headquarters in singapore in the third quarter of along with a new manufacturing and service facility there in the fourth quarter of in we began to manage and report our global sales in three regions the americas  europe africa and asia pacific 
in  of our sales were in the americas compared to in  were in the europe africa region compared to in and were in the asia pacific region  compared to in see also note geographic data to the financial statements below 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our faro arm  faro scan arm  faro gage  faro laser tracker and faro laser scanner ls d measurement equipment  and their related multi faceted software 
revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we sell one and three year extended warranties and training and technology consulting services relating to our products 
we recognize the revenue from extended warranties on a straight line basis 
we also receive royalties from licensing agreements for our historical medical technology and generally recognize the revenue from these royalties as licensees use the technology 
in  we began to manufacture our faro arm products in switzerland for customer orders from the europe africa and asia pacific regions 
we began to manufacture our faro gage product  and parts of our faro laser tracker product in our swiss plant in the third quarter of we began complete production of the faro laser tracker product in our swiss plant in we began to manufacture our faro arm products in our singapore plant in the fourth quarter of and expect to begin production of our faro gage and faro laser tracker there in the first half of we expect our singapore plant will take over from our swiss plant in supplying our asia pacific region s needs for these products 
the manufacture of these products for customer orders from the americas will be done in our manufacturing facilities located in florida and pennsylvania 
our faro laser scanner ls product is currently manufactured in our new german facility  located in stuttgart 
we expect all our existing plants to have the production capacity necessary to support our growth  at least through as previously reported on the company s form k dated march   the company learned that its china subsidiary had made payments to certain customers in china that may have violated the fcpa and other applicable laws 
the company s audit committee instituted an internal investigation into this matter in february  and the company voluntarily notified the sec and the doj of this matter in march the internal investigation into this matter has been completed 
the company has provided to the sec and the doj information obtained during the course of this investigation and is cooperating with both agencies 
the company s internal investigation has identified certain improper payments made in china and deficiencies in its controls with respect to its operations in china in possible violation of the fcpa 
if the sec or the doj determines that violations of the fcpa have occurred  they could seek civil and criminal sanctions  including monetary penalties  against the company and or certain of its employees  as well as additional changes to the company s business practices and compliance programs 
based on current information  it is not possible to predict at this time when the sec or doj investigations will be resolved  what the outcome will be  what sanctions  if any  will be imposed  or the effect that such matters may ultimately have on the company or its consolidated financial statements 
results of the investigation revealed that the referral fee payments in possible violation of the fcpa were  and  in and  respectively  which were recorded in selling expenses in the company s statement of income 
the related sales to customers to which payment of these referral fees had been made totaled approximately million and million in and  respecively 
additional improper referral fee payments of  were made in january and february related to sales contracts in the company anticipates incurring expenses of at least million in relating to its internal investigation of the fcpa matter 
the company has terminated certain personnel in the asia pacific region and has re assigned the duties of other personnel in both the asia pacific region and the us as a result of the internal investigation 
the company is instituting the following remedial measures contracted with a third party forensics accounting team to conduct an in depth audit of the operations in china and in other countries in the asia pacific region and to make recommendations for improvement to the internal control systems 
reviewing third party distributor arrangements in an effort to assure that all contracts include adherence to the fcpa 
performing due diligence on all third party distributors and implementing a process to assess potential new distributors 
established an in house internal audit function including hiring a director of internal audit 
consolidating the human resources  financial accounting and reporting functions for the asia region into the singapore operations 
implemented an internal certification process to ascertain whether similar issues may exist elsewhere in the company 
implemented a quarterly internal certification process to confirm adherence to company policy and all applicable laws and regulations that will include all regional leadership  country management and other sales management 
implementing additional training on fcpa and other matters for employees and a confidential compliance reporting system 
the company had sales in china of million in and million in  approximately and of total sales  respectively 
depending on how this matter is resolved  the company s sales in china could be significantly impacted 
the termination of certain personnel and the cessation of improper payments in china may have a significant adverse effect on future operations in china because such action could negatively influence the decisions of a significant number of customers of the chinese subsidiary to do business with that subsidiary 
the potential magnitude of the loss of sales in china as a result of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act cannot be estimated at this time 
during the company s internal investigation of its business practices in china  it became aware that income taxes related to certain commissions and bonus payments to its employees had not been properly reported 
the company will promptly remit any deficiencies after it has completed its investigation 
at this time  the company does not anticipate the amount will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company may be subject to penalties by the chinese tax authorities  but we are not able to determine the amount  if any  of the assessment 
with respect to the financial performance in  cost of sales consists primarily of material  production overhead and labor 
since our ipo in  annual gross margin has been in the range of of sales 
gross margin for fiscal was within that range at 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales grew significantly in to compared to in the higher percentage in was due to the addition of new sales personnel and related costs while the additional sales people become fully trained and productive 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  rent  utilities and professional and legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses were higher in due in part to an increase in professional and legal expenses of approximately million directly related to increased patent litigation costs  compliance with sarbanes oxley section regarding internal controls and procedures and professional and legal fees resulting from the internal investigation in china 
research and development expenses represent salaries  equipment and third party services 
we have a commitment to support ongoing research and development and intend to continue to fund these efforts at the level of of sales going forward 
we expect to incur minimal expenses in as calculated under the black scholes method of sfas  related to our adoption of sfas r for the expensing of stock options as we vested substantially all of our unvested options in the fourth quarter of the reduction in pre tax charges estimated by the company as a result of the acceleration amounts to approximately million over the course of the original vesting periods 
options to purchase approximately  shares of the company s stock or of the company s outstanding options were accelerated 
the weighted average exercise price of the options subject to acceleration were 
the aggregate pretax expense for the shares subject to acceleration that would have been reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning in is approximately million  including million in  million in  and million in the fair value for any future grants will be included in expense over the vesting periods 
these expenses will be apportioned according to the classification of the employees who have received stock options into cost of sales  selling  general and administrative or research and development costs 
in  our worldwide effective tax rate was 
in we were able to use previously reserved net operating loss carry forwards  which combined with our release of million in valuation allowance reduced our effective tax rate to for we have received a favorable income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant in switzerland  and in have entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board for a favorable multi year income tax rate commitment covering our singapore headquarters and manufacturing operations 
see critical accounting policies income taxes below 
accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and  therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on inter company accounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we are aware of the availability of off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  including cross currency swaps  forward contracts and foreign currency options see foreign exchange exposure below 
however  we do not regularly use such instruments  and none were utilized in   or we have had fourteen consecutive profitable quarters through december  our sales growth and profitability has been a result of a number of factors  including the acquisition of smx  which manufactured the predecessor to the faro laser tracker  the introduction in october of the latest generation of our traditional faro arm product  the introduction of the faro gage in september  the introduction of our faro scan arm product in  and an increase in the number of sales people worldwide 
our worldwide sales and marketing headcount in  and was   and  respectively 
in  the company recorded approximately million in other income as a result of receiving approximately  shares of company stock related to a positive arbitration settlement between the company and the former smx shareholders 
on november   we sold  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in a private placement 
the shares were sold for per share  resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other offering expenses of million 
this transaction significantly increased our cash available for a variety of potential uses including working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and our ongoing international expansion 
on january   the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission allowing it to raise proceeds of up to million 
the proceeds from any offerings with respect to this registration statement  if any  would be used for either repayment or refinancing of debt  acquisition of additional businesses or technologies or for working capital and general corporate purposes 
to date  we have not raised any capital under this form s registration statement 
the company must file in a timely manner all reports under the securities and exchange act of with certain exceptions with the sec for a period of months in order to be able to use its s registration statement

critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for obsolescence  income taxes  and the reserve for warranties 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
revenue recognition revenue related to the company s measurement systems integrated combinations of a measurement device  a computer and software loaded on the computer and the measurement device is recognized upon shipment as the company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date 
the company warrants its products against defects in design  materials and workmanship for one year 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expenses is recorded when products are shipped 
the company separately sells one and three year extended warranties 
extended warranty revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the warranty 
costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as incurred 
revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred  and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible 
revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support  training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed and are deferred when billed in advance of the performance of services 
revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of its technology for medical applications is generally recognized as licensees use the technology 
amounts representing royalties for the current year and not received as of year end are estimated as due based on historical data and recognized in the current year 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory since the amount of inventoriable cost that we will recoup through sales cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely upon both past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
inventory is considered obsolete if we have withdrawn those products from the market or if we had no sales of the product for the past months  and have no sales forecasted for the next months 
inventory is considered excess if the quantity on hand exceeds one year of remaining usage 
the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists 
items without an identified current or future usage will be reserved for in an amount equal to of the average fifo cost of such inventory 
income taxes we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence described in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which we operate unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  our evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
the company operates in a number of different countries around the world 
in  the company began to manufacture its products in switzerland  where it has received a favorable income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant there 
in  the company opened a regional headquarters and began to manufacture its products in singapore  where it has received a favorable multi year income tax rate commitment from the singapore economic development board as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant and regional headquarters there 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
we have appropriately reserved for our tax uncertainties based on the criteria established by sfas  accounting for loss contingencies 
the reserve for warranties the company establishes a liability for included twelve month warranties by the creation of a warranty reserve  which is an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the remaining period of warranty measured in installation months in each major product group 
warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by determining the total repair expenses for each product group in the period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
the rate is multiplied by the number of machine months of warranty for each product group sold during the period to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company reevaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of machines remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each machine will be under warranty 
while such expenses have historically been within its expectations  we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters in lake mary  florida from xenon research  inc  all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by simon raab  the company s chairman and co chief executive officer  and diana raab  his spouse 
the term of the lease expired on february   and is continuing on a month to month basis 
the company expects to renew the lease for an additional years under similar terms 
base rent under the lease is  per year 
foreign exchange exposure we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
at present  approximately of our revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of our operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of our non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases or decreases in the future  our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase or decrease 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued and subsequently revised in december  fin  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
fin defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin r deferred the effective date of fin to the first reporting period ending after december  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  fin may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
the company has determined that it is not party to any variable interest entities 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
retains the general principle of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  that inventories are presumed to be stated at cost  however  it amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  sfas no 
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal production capacity 
the guidance in safs no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that implementing sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 as allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
sfas no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the first method is the modified prospective application whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the second method is the modified retrospective application  which requires that the company restates prior period financial statements 
the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all periods or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption of this statement 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective application transition method 
the company accelerated the vesting for substantially all of its outstanding options prior to december   and expects to record minimal expenses for its remaining unvested stock options during the reduction in pre tax charges estimated by the company as a result of the acceleration amounts to approximately million over the course of the original vesting periods 
the fair value for any future grants will be included in expense over the vesting periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  a slight majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase further 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in
