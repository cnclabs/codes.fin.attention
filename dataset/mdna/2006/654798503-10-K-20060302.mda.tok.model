item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging pharmaceutical company with substantial expertise and intellectual property in nitric oxide based drug development 
our goal is to become a leading  multi product pharmaceutical company by developing innovative nitric oxide based products and by building on our bidil development experience and commercialization infrastructure to identify and market additional products for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts towards the research and development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our currently marketed product  bidil 
since our inception  we have mainly funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding and milestone payments from our collaborative partners 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in june  the fda approved our product  bidil  for the treatment of heart failure in self identified black patients as an adjunct to current standard therapies 
bidil is an orally administered fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride 
we commercially launched bidil in july and generated product sales of million during the year ended december  we market bidil to primary care physicians and cardiologists who treat african americans with heart failure 
our sales and marketing organization is comprised internally of a senior vice president of sales and marketing  a vice president of sales  a vice president of marketing  three regional sales directors and fifteen district sales managers 
in addition  we have an agreement with publicis selling solutions pursuant to which  on our behalf  publicis has employed and trained a specialty sales force currently consisting of sales representatives to sell bidil to our target prescriber markets 
we have also engaged schwarz pharma under a five year exclusive manufacturing and supply agreement exclusively for the three times daily immediate release dosage formulation of bidil 
we are also applying our nitric oxide technology to develop novel pharmaceuticals  as well as safer and more effective versions of existing drugs  to target significant diseases that are characterized by a deficiency in nitric oxide and to treat underserved patient populations 
our nitric oxide development strategy involves the internal development of proprietary nitric oxide enhancing product candidates  such as bidil  the co development of nitric oxide enhancing drugs with partners and the out licensing of our nitric oxide enhancing technology in exchange for potential milestone payments and royalties on sales 
we expect that research  development and commercialization expenses relating to our products and product candidates and to enhancing our core technologies will continue to fluctuate in the near term and may vary significantly from our current estimates 
our operating expenses related to our research and development efforts and our sales  general and administrative costs for the year ended december   total million 
we currently estimate that our operating expenses for fiscal year will range between million and million  excluding cost of product sales and expenses related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with the proceeds from our recent equity offering in january  which generated net proceeds to the company of million  will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan  including operating expenses in support of the launch and commercialization of bidil  for at least the next months 
in the near term  a key driver of our success will be our ability to successfully launch  commercialize and achieve market penetration of bidil 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
at the present time we are unable to estimate the level of revenues that we will realize from sales of bidil or from the other products that we may successfully develop and commercialize 
we are therefore unable to estimate when we will achieve profitability  if at all 
financial operations overview revenue 
our first commercial product  bidil  was launched in july  and generated product sales of million for the year ended december  prior to the launch of bidil  all of our revenue had been derived from license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we received from our corporate collaborators 
in future years  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  license fees  milestone and royalty payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  as well as royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any collaborative revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development  milestone and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships and related continuing obligations  as well as the timing and amount of revenue we recognize for the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities and bidil medical support costs 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs 
we have not provided program costs because prior to we did not track and accumulate cost information by research program 
bidil 
from may to july  we enrolled  patients at clinical sites in the united states in our phase iii clinical trial for bidil 
we halted the trial in july due to a significant survival benefit in the preliminary data for patients taking bidil 
the fda approved bidil on june   and we launched bidil in july the total cost for the bidil a heft trial was approximately million 
bidil life cycle management bidil xr and bidil combination 
the current formulation of bidil is an immediate release tablet that must be taken three times daily 
we are currently pursuing the development of an extended release formulation of bidil  bidil xr  that could be taken either once or twice a day  depending on the particular formulation we pursue 
we are also engaging in research and development efforts to develop bidil combination products which would combine bidil with existing  marketed medicines  such as ace inhibitors  beta blockers  or aldosterone receptor blockers 
cardiovascular portfolio 
we are utilizing our nitric oxide expertise and proprietary position to develop product candidates for a variety of additional medical conditions 
as part of this effort  we recently announced that we expect to file an investigational new drug application ind for nmi  a proprietary nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular agent  in the second quarter of we have retained all commercial rights to this product candidate 
because these programs are in pre clinical development  the successful development of products based upon these programs is highly uncertain 
as such  we are not able to estimate the cost to complete research and development  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing product candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from product sales  milestones and royalties could commence 
nitric oxide enhancing product candidates 
we are using our know how and expertise in nitric oxide to develop new chemical entities  or drugs  that are nitric oxide enhancing versions of existing medicines in the areas of cardiovascular medicine  acute renal failure and other areas 
these studies are at a pre clinical stage of testing  and it remains speculative whether the addition of nitric oxide will result in an improved clinical profile of these medicines 
the many uncertainties involved with the development of successful new products will exist until a new product candidate successfully passes all preclinical safety testing as well as clinical evaluation 
a new and novel nitric oxide enhancing medicine will take several years and involve a significant and largely unknown sum of expenditures 
the success of achieving a new nitric oxide enhancing medicine is important as it is needed to fill our pipeline 
failure to produce and successfully commercialize a new product in a timely fashion may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
nitric oxide stents 
we formerly had a research agreement with boston scientific to develop cardiovascular stents enhanced with a bio compatible polymer that is capable of releasing nitric oxide 
the research program under this agreement focused on pre clinical development 
in accordance with the terms of our agreement with boston scientific  the research term expired in december we expect that additional expenditures will be required in the area of nitric oxide stents development  if we should choose to pursue this area either alone or together with another collaborative partner to conduct pre clinical testing and  if such pre clinical testing is successful  to apply for and conduct clinical trials 
because our former program was in pre clinical development  the successful development of products based upon this program is highly uncertain 
as such  we are unable to estimate the cost to complete any future research and development  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing any product candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence 
our failure  or any future partner s failure  to commercialize products based upon this program on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
from december until november  we had a collaboration with merck frosst canada co  a wholly owned subsidiary of merck co  or merck  to screen proprietary nitric oxide enhanced cox inhibitors in advance of clinical testing as analgesic and anti inflammatory agents and in other specified disease areas 
these agents are intended to be second generation cox inhibitors 
on september   merck halted the phase ii trial of our lead candidate in nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
in november  we agreed with merck to terminate the collaboration agreement 
we retain all rights to our technology in the field of nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors and may seek collaborations with other potential partners to utilize the full value  if any  of this technology in the development of new analgesic and anti inflammatory agents 
significant additional expenditures will be required to conduct pre clinical testing and to apply for  and conduct  clinical trials 
because these agents are in pre clinical development  their successful development is highly uncertain 
as such  we are not able to estimate the cost to complete the research and development phase  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing potential candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence 
our failure  or any future partner s failure  to commercialize these product candidates under development on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales  general and administrative 
consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in sales and marketing  executive  finance  investor relations  accounting  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs for public relations  advertising and promotion services  professional fees for legal and accounting services  and costs related to our third party contract sales agreement with publicis selling solutions  inc  or publicis 
non operating income 
includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and interest expense associated with our long term debt 
boston scientific collaboration 
in november  we entered into a research  development and license agreement with boston scientific in the field of restenosis 
we granted boston scientific an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular stents 
we also granted to boston scientific a right of first refusal to obtain an exclusive license under our nitric oxide technologies to commercialize products for restenosis  which right of first refusal is for a period of three years after the end of the research term 
in december  we agreed to extend the agreement to continue the research and development collaboration through december boston scientific made an up front license payment of million to us in  and made an additional payment of million in december in connection with the extension of the research and development collaboration 
in the event that specified research  development and commercialization milestones were achieved  boston scientific would have been obligated to make milestone payments to us 
in addition  boston scientific also would have been obligated to pay royalties to us on the sale of any products resulting from the collaboration 
boston scientific made a million equity investment in our stock in in august  in connection with a private placement  boston scientific made an additional  equity investment in our stock 
the research term of the boston scientific agreement expired on december   although certain rights extend beyond this term 
we intend to evaluate the continued development of this technology and in the future may seek collaboration with other potential partners 
merck collaboration 
from december until november  we were party to an exclusive  worldwide research  collaboration and licensing agreement that granted merck marketing and sales rights for nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
the research portion of the agreement was for three years 
in  we received an upfront non refundable license payment of million and two payments  each of million  for achieving the first two milestones 
the license fee revenue and the revenue from the first million milestone payment were being recognized ratably over the contractual term of the research and development program  which was expected to end on december  the revenue from the second million payment was recognized in the fourth quarter of  the period in which merck achieved the milestone 
on september   merck halted the phase ii trial of our lead candidate in nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
this lead nitric oxide candidate is composed of a derivative of rofecoxib 
rofecoxib is the active ingredient in vioxx  a cox inhibitor which merck voluntarily withdrew from worldwide markets on september  in november  we agreed with merck to terminate the collaboration agreement 
merck paid us a lump sum of million in  representing the full amount of the research funding that was owed to us for we will not receive any commercialization milestones or royalty payments from merck 
as a result of the termination of this agreement  we accelerated the recognition of deferred license revenue of million in the fourth quarter of  and we recognized the lump sum payment of million as revenue in the fourth quarter of results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in product sales were million for the year ended december  due to the commercial launch of bidil in july there were no product sales for the years ended december   and research and development revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the million  or decrease in revenue in compared to  is primarily due to the termination of the merck agreement in november for the year ended december   research and development revenues totaled million  a or million increase in revenue in compared to this increase is primarily attributable to our collaboration agreement with merck  which was terminated in november in we recognized million in revenue under this agreement  which included all amounts previously deferred 
due to the termination of this collaboration agreement  we no longer have any future performance obligations  and accordingly  we recognized previously deferred license revenue of million 
in addition  we recognized million that was originally scheduled to be paid to us during for research and development funding  but was instead paid to us in when the agreement was terminated 
we also recognized an additional million in revenue in over relating to the december extension of our agreement with boston scientific 
the research term of this agreement with boston scientific expired on december  in accordance with its terms  and we do not expect to receive any additional payments under this agreement 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased to million in from in due to the launch of bidil in july included in cost of product sales is an inventory impairment charge of million related to short dated commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and a million charge for contractual purchase commitments 
the charges are due to the company s current estimate of inventory requirements based on its sales forecast 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or increase in research and development expenses in compared with is primarily the result of increased clinical and medical expenses which support the commercial launch of bidil in the areas of continuing medical education  clinical advisory boards  medical services fees  publications and other various contracted services totaling million 
we also incurred increased research and development expenses in of million related to product development projects 
offsetting the increased medical support and research expenses in is a decrease of million in clinical trial expenses as a result of the completion of the a heft trial  in  a decrease in drug manufacturing expense of million and a decrease in compensation expense of million 
the million  or increase in research and development expenses in compared with is primarily the result of an additional million of expenses associated with the bidil trial  including costs associated with the halt of the a heft trial  commencement of the open label a heft trial x a heft  and the preparation and filing of an amended nda with the fda 
we also incurred increased research and development expenses in of million related to compensation related expenses due to additional headcount and non cash stock based compensation related expense  million related to preparation of contract manufacturing capabilities relating to the potential bidil product line  million pertaining to milestone payments under a collaboration and license agreement for bidil  and increased outside consulting costs of million 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for our principal research and development programs for the fiscal years ended december   and december  research and development program bidil nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular compounds nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors nitric oxide stents other total research and development expense sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to an increase of million for the implementation of our contract sales force under our agreement with publicis  million for the hiring of sales and marketing management personnel  and million for advertising and promotional services and public relations 
we also incurred higher general and administrative expense in due to increased costs of million associated with the accrual of business development expenses pertaining to the approval process for bidil  million pertaining to additional legal and consulting expenses  million related to the hiring of executive management and additional administrative personnel 
sales  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the million  or increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to million for the preparation for the potential launch of bidil  including costs relating to the payment of contract sales personnel  hiring of sales and marketing management personnel  public relations services  and advertising and promotion services 
we also incurred higher general and administrative expense in due to increased costs of million associated with business development and milestone payment expenses pertaining to the approval process for bidil  million pertaining to additional legal and consulting expenses  million related to the hiring of executive management and additional administrative personnel  an increase in insurance costs of million due to operating as a public company  and higher infrastructure related expenses of million  including moving to a new facility 
non operating income 
non operating income increased to million in compared to million in and million in the million  or increase in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to higher interest income due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates in  offset by interest expense related to long term debt 
the million  or increase in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to higher average fund balances available for investment and higher interest rates due to investing in longer maturity securities 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through the sale of equity  debt and payments from collaborative partners for licenses  research and development and achievement of milestones 
as of december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments  primarily as the result of the sale of million of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in november  net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in december  and million in debt financing in june  which is described below 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and in january  we raised an additional million in net proceeds from an equity financing from the sale of million shares of our common stock 
in january  we completed a direct offering of shares of our common stock previously registered under our effective shelf registration statement  which was filed with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  in august pursuant to this offering  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock to selected institutional investors at a price of per share 
proceeds to us from this offering  net of offering expenses and placement agency fees  totaled approximately million 
on june   we borrowed i million from oxford finance corporation oxford and ii million from general electric capital corporation gecc pursuant to the terms of promissory notes made by us with both oxford and gecc  respectively 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and accrued interest  beginning july  the notes are secured by a security interest in all our personal property and fixtures with the exception of any intellectual property or products acquired  whether by purchase  license or otherwise  on or after the execution of the notes 
the agreements that we entered into with each of oxford and gecc in connection with the notes also contain a material adverse change clause with both oxford and gecc 
under this clause  if oxford or gecc reasonably determine that our ability to repay the notes has been materially impaired  we would be considered in default 
as of december   we were in compliance with this clause 
as of december  we had paid aggregate principal in the amount of million 
during the year ended december   operating activities used cash of million primarily due to a net loss of million  and increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million due to launching bidil  capitalizing inventory  and shipping product 
these cash flow decreases are offset by adjustments for non cash charges for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
during the year ended december   investing activities provided cash of million due to the net sales of marketable securities of million  offset by the purchases of computer and lab equipment of million due to an increase in personnel 
we expect to invest million to million for capital expenditures in  principally related to the purchase of laboratory equipment and computer equipment to support headcount growth 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of million due to proceeds from million in long term debt and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans  offset by million in principal payments on long term debt 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than five years operating lease obligation long term debt purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in november  as amended in may  we entered into an agreement with publicis  a contract sales organization  pursuant to which  on our behalf  publicis has employed and trained a specialty sales force currently consisting of approximately sales representatives to sell bidil to our target prescriber markets 
the agreement is for a current term of months beginning on january   with our option to continue the agreement beyond this term 
year one costs recorded in were million  excluding one time start up costs  and year two costs under the agreement are projected at approximately million 
we have the right to terminate this agreement upon days written notice to publicis 
if we had terminated this agreement during the period between january  and january   we would have been required to pay a termination fee in the amount of million 
if we terminate during the period between january  and july   the termination fee will be  if we terminate the agreement after july   publicis is not eligible for a termination fee 
other purchase obligations are million in purchase commitments to schwarz pharma for manufacture of finished goods in the first and second quarter of we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including the net proceeds received from the sale of million shares of our common stock in january  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including increases in spending for the launch and commercialization of bidil and our current development programs  for at least months from the date of this report 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to continue to support the commercial launch of bidil  and to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to develop and launch our other product candidates 
we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including the following the costs of launching and commercializing bidil  the magnitude of product sales of bidil  the timing  receipt  and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from potential collaborators  the timing  receipt  and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our potential product candidates  the resources required to successfully complete our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims  the cost of obtaining and maintaining licenses to use patented technologies  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  inventory  accrued expenses and the factors used to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
our principal source of revenue is the sale of bidil  which began shipping in july of other sources of revenue to date include license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we have received from our corporate collaborators 
product sales deferred revenue 
we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers or pharmacies  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collect ability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  rebates  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
in addition  we evaluate our level of shipments to wholesalers and pharmacies on a quarterly basis compared to the estimated level of inventory in the channel  remaining shelf life of the product shipped and quarterly forecasted sales 
as a result of this evaluation  we deferred million of revenue from december shipments and recorded this amount in deferred revenue as of december  also  the cost of bidil associated with amounts recorded as deferred revenue are recorded in inventory until such time as risk of loss has passed 
sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts 
our product sales are subject to returns  allowances  rebates and discounts that are customary in the pharmaceutical industry 
a large portion of our product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to patients  who are consumers of the product 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates and cash and contract discounts 
we determine our provisions for sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts based primarily on estimates and on contractual terms 
in developing a reasonable estimate for the reserve for product returns  we considered the factors in paragraph of sfas  revenue recognition when a right of return exists 
although we have not yet developed our own history of product returns because of the recent launch of bidil  we believe we can develop a reasonable estimate of returns 
bidil is a heart failure drug that is similar to other drugs in the marketplace which have similar channels of distribution  similar shelf lives and similar return rights 
we were able to verify through discussions with other pharmaceutical firms that promote and sell these other drugs that our initial estimate of returns is reasonable in relation to product launch 
we will continue to monitor actual returns as we gain more sales experience with bidil 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow customers to return product only during the period that is three months prior to  and twelve months after product expiration 
commercial product shipped during had a shelf life of twelve months from date of manufacture with expiration dates ranging from april to august factors that are considered in our estimate of future product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channels  discussions with key wholesalers and other customers regarding inventory levels and shipment trends  review of consumer consumption data as reported by source projected launchtrac  wolters kluwer health  return rates for similar pharmaceutical products that are sold in the same distribution channel  the remaining time to expiration of our product and our forecast of future sales of our product 
at december   our product return reserve was  this reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
initial trade shipments incentive 
during july of  we offered certain product stocking incentives to a number of wholesalers and pharmacy customers 
these incentives included units with guaranteed sales provisions and extended payment terms 
as a result of these provisions  we concluded that these sales were essentially consignment sales as the risk of loss of these units has not passed to the customer 
accordingly  we have deferred all revenue related to these units until such time as the unit is provided to a patient with a prescription 
as of december   the remaining balance of deferred revenue related to these units is million 
cash incentives 
during the third quarter of  we offered certain additional incentives to a number of pharmacy customers 
these cash incentives included placement and advertising assistance in the amount of  we recorded this amount as a reduction to revenue during the year ended december  sample voucher program 
beginning in the third quarter of  we initiated a sample voucher program whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free day trial approximately tablets of bidil 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf no 

these initial sample vouchers had an expiration date of september  at which time we reduced revenue for the actual amount of reimbursement claims received for the vouchers distributed during the third quarter of this program was repeated during the fourth quarter with sample vouchers that had an expiration date of december   at which time we reduced revenue for the actual amount of reimbursement claims received for the vouchers distributed during the fourth quarter of as a result of this program  we recorded a reduction to revenue of  for the year ended december  we expect to continue to offer sample voucher incentives in future periods 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances result primarily from sales under contract with wholesalers  healthcare providers  medicaid programs and other governmental agencies 
we estimate rebates and contractual allowances  cash and contract discounts and other rebates by considering the following factors current contract prices and terms  estimated customer and wholesaler inventory levels and current average rebate rates 
for the year end december   we recorded cash discounts  rebates and other allowances of  collaboration revenue 
we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  are deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
in future periods  we expect revenues derived from collaboration agreements will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue  and product revenues will continue to increase based on anticipated increased volume of prescriptions of bidil 
inventories 
we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventories at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventories is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventories could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
bidil currently has a twelve month shelf life 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our current inventory levels and future irrevocable inventory purchase commitments and write down inventory that has become un saleable  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and irrevocable inventory purchase commitments that are in excess of expected future inventory requirements based on our sales forecasts 
expired inventory will be disposed of  and the related costs will be written off 
for the year ended december   we recorded an inventory impairment charge of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and a million charge to cost of sales for contractual purchase commitments 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers for the production of finished goods  marketing and medical support fees  such as advisory boards  and publications  marketing service fees and professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to follow accounting principle board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas in and  certain grants of stock options were made at exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock and  as a result  we recorded deferred stock compensation expense 
in the notes to our financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas and the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas and eitf requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or under stated 
for equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services  we estimate the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deem to be relevant at that time 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to the commencement of our public offering on november   market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  pricing of private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  and the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors contemporaneously with the grant 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights  voting control and anti dilution protection attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock  the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering  our existing financial resources  our anticipated continuing operating losses and increased spending levels required to complete our clinical trials  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting pronouncement on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  referred to as sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted in fiscal periods beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r on january   the commencement of our first quarter of fiscal sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company anticipates adopting the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in note to our financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations  including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate and us government related securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of two years or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
