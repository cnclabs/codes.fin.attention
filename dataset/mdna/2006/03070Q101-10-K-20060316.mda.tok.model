competition st 
charles ameristar st 
charles competes with four other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in the state of illinois 
unlike the state of missouri  illinois does not impose a per person  per two hour session buy in limit  does not require a casino issued identification card to enter a casino and allows credit play 
however  illinois casinos are limited in the number of gaming positions allowed and are subject to a higher rate of gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
although there were no major capital improvements or expansions in the st 
louis market in  several announced capital projects related to casino entertainment facilities are expected to be completed within the next three years 
construction has commenced on a million casino entertainment complex at laclede s landing in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the new facility  which will incorporate a remodeled embassy suites hotel  is slated to open in late and will feature a mix of restaurants  conference space  and a  square foot casino 
the president casino  also located in downtown st 
louis  is currently operating in bankruptcy and the fate of this operation remains unclear 
the laclede s landing developer is also currently in the process of seeking the necessary zoning and permit approvals for a development project in lemay  which is located in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
the lemay project is expected to include a million hotel and casino entertainment complex and is currently slated for opening in mid in east st 
louis  illinois  a gaming operator has announced plans for a million casino barge project that is expected to upgrade the current facility in phases prior to the opening of the laclede s landing project 
the initial phase is a million expansion project that will replace the existing  square foot casino 
the new casino will consist of  square feet of casino space and will be located several hundred feet away  which will likely minimize construction disruption 
phase one is expected to commence at the end of the first quarter of and be completed by june the second and third phases of the project will include additional restaurants and hotel rooms  a new entertainment facility and a parking garage 
estimated completion dates for the second and third phases have not been announced 

table of contents the alton belle casino in alton  illinois  across the mississippi river and north of st 
louis  had a change in control in connection with the acquisition of its parent company by another gaming company in mid the acquiring company has not announced plans for any changes it may make at the alton belle 
the addition of two gaming licenses in the st 
louis market  as well as any replacement or upgrade to the president or alton belle casinos  would result in additional competition for ameristar st 
charles 
the state of illinois has one dormant gaming license that it has announced it intends to reissue in the greater chicago area 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
a competitor in riverside  missouri  located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city  is currently constructing a hotel and replacing its parking garage 
the project is slated for completion in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  our primary competitor completed a million property renovation  which included the addition of hotel rooms  several new restaurants  an expanded parking area  a nightclub and several new non gaming amenities 
the other competitor did not undertake any major capital improvements or expansions in the kansas city market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
the diverse amenity base of the kansas city area casinos should serve to mitigate impact upon outer market table game play to the kansas city region

council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued for the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other competitors are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a pari mutuel racetrack casino  which currently only offers slot machines 
in  the iowa legislature enacted a bill which permits the operation of table games and video poker at pari mutuel racetracks 
the competing racetrack casino is developing an million expansion of its land based facility  which will be rebranded and include  square feet of gaming space inclusive of space for newly approved table games  a  space parking garage and several other non gaming amenities 
the project is scheduled for completion in march we anticipate that this will create increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
the council bluffs market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competing gaming jurisdiction located approximately miles away 
in  the electorate of the state of nebraska considered various proposals to legalize casino gaming 
none of the referenda were approved  which approvals could have had a material impact on the council bluffs casino gaming market 
in the future  the state of nebraska may again consider legalization of casino gaming which  if passed  would likely result in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs

vicksburg ameristar vicksburg competes with three other gaming operations located in vicksburg 
one competitor completed a million renovation of its buffet in mid another competitor is currently undergoing an expansion project that will create additional restaurant space and is slated for completion 
table of contents in mid there were no major capital improvements or expansions by the other vicksburg market competitor in since the third quarter of  the vicksburg market has received increased patron visitation resulting from the destruction and subsequent closure of the majority of casinos in the mississippi gulf coast region from hurricane katrina 
this increase in visitation has diminished in the first quarter of following the reopening of three casinos in biloxi  mississippi  and we expect that it will further diminish as more gulf coast casinos reopen later this year 
in february  one of our competitors in vicksburg announced the sale of its property to a privately owned company 
the sale is pending regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of the new owner has not yet disclosed its plans for the property 
several potential gaming sites still exist in or near vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos 
in early  the mississippi gaming commission granted preliminary approval for the fifth and sixth casino licenses in the vicksburg market 
one developer has proposed building a million casino facility  which includes a room hotel  parking garage and other non gaming amenities 
this project was originally planned to start construction at the beginning of  but a recent announcement indicated the commencement of construction will be delayed to the other proposal calls for the construction of a million casino facility with limited amenities 
to proceed  additional approvals are required from the mississippi gaming commission 
at this time  the earliest either of these projects could open would be late or early in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop additional native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed 
the vicksburg market also faces regional competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg 
black hawk mountain high competes with approximately other gaming operations located in the black hawk central city gaming market in colorado 
of the competing casinos  only five are considered large competitors  with over  square feet of gaming space 
mountain high has the largest gaming floor of any casino in the black hawk market 
mountain high s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering black hawk from denver via route this competitor recently completed a million expansion of its property and the adjacent gaming establishment it purchased in the expansion of the combined properties increased the number of hotel rooms and parking capacity and connected the two properties via an enclosed skywalk 
a partial expansion of the parking complex and gaming area was completed in the fourth quarter of with on going construction throughout the remainder of the parking and hotel complex was completed in february in  the black hawk market was adversely affected by the closure of route  a primary artery for drive in traffic from the denver metropolitan area  for three months due to rockslides 
the road closure decreased overall visitation to the black hawk market and resulted in increased visitation to central city  colorado casinos due to easier access to this market off of interstate the black hawk central city gaming market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
however  there have been several proposals for the development of a native american casino located in the denver metropolitan area 
should a casino development in the denver area occur  the black hawk central city market would face increased competition

risk factors the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain customers 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
from time to time  legislation and ballot measures have been unsuccessfully proposed in kansas  nebraska and colorado for the legalization or expansion of gaming 
in nebraska  several referenda on the statewide ballot that would have legalized two alternative forms of casino gaming were defeated in november  and proponents are currently gathering signatures to attempt to have similar referenda placed on the november ballot 
in kansas  there is currently a bill pending in the legislature that would legalize commercial casino gaming 
these proposals  if they become law  would authorize gaming in or near  among other places  omaha  nebraska and kansas city  kansas  in close proximity to our existing facilities in council bluffs  iowa and kansas city  missouri  respectively 
the legalization of gaming in these locations and the additional competition resulting from the subsequent development of competing gaming properties could have a material adverse effect on us 
the missouri gaming commission has prioritized for investigation gaming license applications for new casino facilities in downtown st 
louis and southeastern st 
louis county  approximately miles and miles  respectively  from ameristar st 
charles 
the casino facility in downtown st 
louis is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in late the southeastern st 
louis county facility  which is being developed by the same operator  is currently scheduled to open in mid st 
louis city officials and members of the missouri gaming commission have also stated that they would like to see a currently operating casino in downtown st 
louis  which is currently operating in bankruptcy  improved or replaced 
the additional two new gaming operations in the st 
louis market  as well as any replacement or upgrade to the existing downtown st 
louis casino  will result in additional competition for ameristar st 
charles 
in march  our competitor that operates the pari mutuel racetrack casino in council bluffs will rebrand the property as part of a major expansion and renovation 
upon completion of the expansion and renovation project  the property will feature significantly more gaming space   slot machines  table games  a poker room and additional non gaming amenities 
prior to a change in iowa law in  racetrack casinos were not permitted to offer table games or video poker machines 
we expect that the 
table of contents future operating results of ameristar council bluffs will be adversely affected by the additional competition 
our principal competitors in the st 
louis and black hawk markets have also recently completed  or will soon complete  significant expansions of their facilities 
in vicksburg  several potential gaming sites still exist  and two companies have recently received preliminary mississippi gaming commission approval for the development of new casinos 
increased competitive pressures in our missouri and iowa markets have required us to incur greater marketing and promotional costs in order to maintain our market share 
this has adversely affected our recent operating results  and may continue to do so 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
we believe that recent operating results at our jackpot properties have been adversely affected by intensified competition from an idaho native american facility that is closer to a portion of our market area 
the legislatures in kansas and nebraska are considering pending legislation that would allow various forms of native american gaming in close proximity to our properties in kansas city and council bluffs 
additionally  two federally recognized tribes have asserted land claims in colorado and are attempting to have land in metropolitan denver placed in trust by the federal government to be used for casino gaming 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in  in response to an iowa supreme court ruling that decreased the gaming taxes payable by casinos at pari mutuel racetracks  the iowa legislature approved an increase in the maximum tax rate on gaming revenues of riverboat casinos from to  which became effective july  we also paid in and will be required to pay in a special additional assessment of approximately million  which is recoverable as a credit against future gaming taxes beginning in this tax increase has negatively impacted operating income at ameristar council bluffs and will continue to do so 
several bills have been introduced in the missouri legislature in recent years that would increase the gaming tax rate  and similar legislation has been introduced in the current session 
in colorado  the colorado limited gaming control commission has the authority to establish the gaming tax rate on an annual basis  up to a maximum rate of of gross receipts  without further legislative action 
the current rate of on gross receipts over million has been in effect since 
table of contents if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to further increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our gaming licenses in missouri need to be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa and colorado must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
financial leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
our leverage ratio as defined in our senior credit facilities improved from as of december  to as of december   while our total indebtedness increased from million as of december  to million as of december  as we proceed with our planned capital improvement projects over the next three years  we anticipate that our total debt will increase significantly 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 

table of contents the agreement governing our senior credit facilities contains covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
all of our borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as of february   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
if short term interest rates continue to rise  our interest cost will increase  which will adversely affect our net income and available cash 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by economic downturns and instability  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions or significant increases in energy prices could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as terrorism or the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
we have limited opportunities to grow our business 
the casino gaming industry has limited growth opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business

certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event mr 
neilsen sells a significant portion of his stock or upon his death if his estate  private foundation  heirs or devisees sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
the major hurricanes experienced in the gulf coast region in and the resulting reconstruction efforts have exacerbated shortages of certain construction materials and labor and resulted in increased construction costs 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we employ fast track design and construction methods in some of our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe that the use of fast track design and construction methods can reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve additional construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may 
table of contents increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our planned expansion project at ameristar vicksburg presents unique engineering and construction challenges 
we intend shortly to commence an expansion of the casino vessel at ameristar vicksburg and to connect the vessel to the new parking garage under construction at the site 
in order to do so  we will be required to pour a concrete foundation and rest the vessel on fixed supports similar in design to a dry dock while the vessel remains in the existing cofferdam basin 
we plan to do this without suspending operations at the casino 
this project presents significant engineering and construction challenges and we believe that our combination of methods may never before have been tried under comparable conditions 
we have not been able to procure on practicable terms contractual protections and insurance coverage sufficient to protect us against all possible losses arising out of the project 
if the casino vessel were to sustain significant damage or be required to cease operations for an extended period  our business may be materially adversely affected 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
if any of our key personnel leaves us  our business may be significantly affected 
we depend on the continued performance of craig h 
neilsen  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the rest of our management team 
if we lose the services of mr 
neilsen  any of our other key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market for qualified property and corporate management personnel is subject to intense competition 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel is particularly difficult at ameristar vicksburg  mountain high and the jackpot properties due to local market conditions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if 
table of contents multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel currently floats and where we are planning to dry dock the vessel on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps  if any  may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities in an amount that we are unable to reasonably estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 
we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities

risk factors 
overview we develop  own and operate casinos and related hotel  food and beverage  entertainment and other facilities  with seven properties in operation in missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado and nevada 
our portfolio of casinos consists of ameristar st 
charles serving greater st 
louis  missouri  ameristar kansas city serving the kansas city  missouri metropolitan area  ameristar council bluffs serving omaha  nebraska and southwestern iowa  ameristar vicksburg serving jackson  mississippi and monroe  louisiana  cactus petes and the horseshu in jackpot  nevada serving idaho and the pacific northwest  and mountain high in black hawk  colorado serving the denver metropolitan area 
we acquired mountain high on december  our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those patrons spend per visit 
management uses various metrics to evaluate these factors 
key metrics include market share  representing our share of gross gaming revenues in each of our markets other than jackpot and our share of gaming devices in the jackpot market nevada does not publish separate gaming revenue statistics for this market  admissions  representing the number of patrons admitted to our casinos in jurisdictions that record admissions  and win per admission  representing the amount of gaming revenues we generate per admission 
our operating results may be affected by  among other things  competitive factors  gaming tax increases  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities  general public sentiment regarding travel  overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 
the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance mountain high casino acquisition and expansion 
as part of our strategy to grow the company  we acquired mountain high in black hawk  colorado on december  mountain high contributed million to net revenues and million to operating income during mountain high s financial results were adversely impacted by significant construction disruption as we continue to progress toward the completion of our planned capital improvement projects at the property and a temporary highway closure during the third quarter 
the expansion of the parking garage  which nearly doubled the capacity to  parking spaces  was completed in november and the remodeling of the casino and non gaming venues on the first floor was substantially completed in december in march  we completed the second floor of the casino  which includes an additional slot machines 
we intend to rebrand mountain high under the ameristar name on april  the construction of a room aaa four diamond quality hotel is planned to begin in the second quarter of and is expected to be completed in mid year we believe the quality and scope of the property will enable us to become the market share leader in the greater denver market after these improvements are completed 
we expect the total cost of our planned capital improvements at mountain high to be approximately million  which will bring our total investment in the 
table of contents property to approximately million 
capital expenditures relating to the mountain high remodeling and expansion projects totaled million in promotional spending and marketing 
for the year ended december   promotional allowances at our ameristar branded properties increased million over the prior year while net revenues at these properties increased only 
the increase in our rate of promotional spending was partially attributable to our ongoing efforts to strengthen the ameristar brand through targeted marketing  as evidenced by a increase in rated play at our ameristar branded properties for year ended december  compared to the same period in in addition to improving rated play  our promotional spending also increased as a result of our efforts to maintain market share leadership in the increasingly competitive missouri and iowa markets 
the st 
louis market has developed into a more competitive environment  in response to which we were required to increase marketing and promotional spending at ameristar st 
charles to maintain our competitive position in the market 
the increasingly competitive market and our efforts to attract rated players contributed to a percentage point decrease in operating income margin at our st 
charles property year over year 
our kansas city property was also impacted by increased competition in that partially contributed to a million rise in promotional allowances and a relatively flat operating income margin year over year 
during  our council bluffs property benefited from significant construction disruption and a reduced number of available slot machines at the competing racetrack casino  which is being significantly expanded and rebranded 
we believe that competition will intensify in this market as the improvements at the racetrack casino are completed  which is expected to occur throughout the first quarter of accordingly  we anticipate promotional spending will increase in our effort to maintain our market share 
post hurricane improvement at ameristar vicksburg 
in  ameristar vicksburg increased operating income by million  or  over the prior year 
the improved financial performance of this property is mostly attributable to the substantial increase in business volume following the closure of the gulf coast casinos as a result of hurricane katrina 
this increase in the property s business volume has diminished in the first quarter of following the reopening of three mississippi gulf coast casinos in december  and we expect it to diminish further as more gulf coast casinos reopen later in however  we anticipate revenues to be significantly higher than until the fourth quarter of rising health benefit costs 
for the year ended december   our health benefit costs at properties we have owned for consecutive years and our corporate office increased million  or  over the prior year 
the rise in health benefit costs in excess of normal inflationary trends is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the number and size of large claims experienced in external development costs 
development activities contributed to our increased corporate expense as we continue to pursue growth through development and acquisition opportunities 
development related costs totaled million in compared to million in for the years ended december  and  we incurred costs relating to our pursuit of a casino license in pennsylvania totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
however  following an in depth analysis of the philadelphia market  operational projections and construction cost estimates  we determined that execution of our core business strategy of developing first class gaming and entertainment properties could not generate a sufficient return on our investment to justify proceeding with a casino license application for philadelphia 
accordingly  we suspended our development efforts in pennsylvania in november renovations and enhancements at ameristar st 
charles 
at ameristar st 
charles  we have commenced the construction of a room  all suite hotel  an indoor outdoor swimming pool  a 
table of contents  square foot full service spa   square feet of new meeting and conference facilities and an additional  space parking garage 
the total cost of these projects is expected to be approximately million  with the completion dates projected to be the second quarter of for the conference facilities  the fourth quarter of for the initial  spaces of the parking garage and the fourth quarter of for the hotel and the remainder of the garage 
we believe these planned improvements will allow us to further enhance our competitive position in the st 
louis market  which should position us to extend our market share leadership 
we expect minimal construction disruption to existing operations as these capital improvement projects are being completed 
expansion project at ameristar vicksburg 
at ameristar vicksburg  we have commenced the first phase of our master expansion plan with the construction of a new  space parking garage  which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of in june  we intend to commence an expansion of the casino vessel that will directly connect to the new parking garage 
the expanded casino will allow for the addition of up to slot machines 
the expansion project will also include the addition of two new restaurants  a new star club for our vip guests  a poker room  a retail shop and other amenities 
this project is slated for a mid year completion 
the expected cost of our planned capital improvements at ameristar vicksburg is approximately million 
these improvements will help alleviate long standing capacity constraints in parking and gaming positions  and we believe will allow us to increase our market dominance in vicksburg 
debt management 
on november   we obtained a new billion senior secured credit facility that includes a million seven year term loan facility and a five year revolving loan facility with capacity for borrowing up to million 
the proceeds from the new term loan were primarily used to repay all million principal amount of loans outstanding under the replaced senior secured credit facilities 
the new credit facility features lower interest rate add ons compared to our previous senior secured credit facilities and  together with operating cash flows  will provide the funding for our planned capital improvement projects 
in february  we utilized funds borrowed under the revolving loan facility to redeem our senior subordinated notes due  which we expect will result in a further significant reduction in our borrowing costs 
net interest expense for increased million  or  over the prior year as a result of rises in our average interest rate and long term debt level 
we improved our total debt leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement from at december  to at december

charles maintained its market share leadership position for with of the market  despite a percentage point decrease from the prior year 
casino revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from  including increases in slot and poker revenues of and  respectively 
the increased gaming revenues are mostly attributable to the continued improvement in our slot product and the other factors described above 
we further believe casino revenues increased in part as a result of our continued successful implementation of our targeted marketing programs  which is evidenced by the increase in rated play at our ameristar branded properties when compared to in  we believe our slot product and targeted marketing efforts were the principal reasons we achieved market share leadership for the third consecutive year in all markets where we operated  with the exception of mountain high  which is currently undergoing a major renovation and expansion

the property s improved financial performance and the growth in the vicksburg market are mostly attributable to the third quarter closure of the gulf coast casinos following hurricane katrina 
our jackpot properties net revenues improved by million over the previous year 
the increase in net revenues is mostly attributable to effective slot marketing that resulted in a million improvement in slot revenues year over year 
our mountain high property contributed million to the increase in consolidated annual net revenues in for the year ended december   casino revenues were million  which represents a million increase over the day period we owned the property in slot revenues totaled million in mountain high contributed million to the increase in consolidated promotional allowances during operating income in  consolidated operating income increased million  or  over  while consolidated operating income margin decreased by percentage points from the prior year 
the growth in operating income was substantially attributable to ameristar vicksburg s strong financial performance following the closure of the gulf coast casinos by hurricane katrina 
the vicksburg property s financial results were somewhat offset by greater than expected construction disruption at mountain high  higher corporate costs and increased competitive pressures experienced by our missouri and iowa properties  which negatively impacted consolidated operating income and the related margin 
ameristar st 
charles experienced a decline in operating income of million  or  in  compared to the previous year 
the operating income margin also decreased in by percentage points 
operating income and the related margin were negatively impacted by a more competitive market environment that resulted in an increase of million in marketing and promotional costs 
additionally  the property reported increases in employee compensation and related benefits of million and depreciation expense of million in ameristar kansas city increased income from operations in by million  or  over the year ended december  in  operating income margin improved slightly percentage point over the previous year 
we believe that the improvements at our kansas city property were mostly attributable to the effective implementation of our core operating strategies  particularly revenue enhancement through the deployment of new slot product and cost containment initiatives related to our food and beverage operations 
for the year ended december   ameristar council bluffs reported an increase in operating income of million  higher than in operating income margin also improved by percentage point in as a result of management s effective implementation of cost containment initiatives during a period of revenue growth 
we continued to benefit from significant construction disruption and a reduced number of available slot machines at the competing racetrack casino

the improvements in the operating income 
table of contents and margin were mostly due to revenue growth from the increased business volume mentioned above and effective containment of marketing and promotional costs 
we expect this increase in the property s business volume to diminish as the gulf coast casinos reopen  as we have experienced to date in the first quarter of operating income at our jackpot properties improved by million  or  in and operating income margin increased percentage points compared to the operating results were favorably impacted by gaming revenue growth and a reduction in entertainment and marketing costs 
mountain high s operating income and the related margin for were negatively affected by significant construction disruption relating to the casino expansion project and the temporary closure of a principal highway between black hawk and denver in the third quarter 
corporate expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  over this increase resulted primarily from million of additional employee compensation and benefit costs and increased development activities 
development related costs totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase over the prior year 
interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million in compared to million in total interest cost in was million  an increase of million over the increase is due primarily to a rise in our average libor based interest rate on our senior credit facilities year over year and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our long term debt level resulting from the million borrowed in december to acquire mountain high 
the increases in the average interest rate and long term debt level were partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense resulting from the termination of our interest rate swap agreement on march  and an increase in capitalized interest from million in to million in capitalized interest in primarily related to the capital improvement projects at mountain high and the hotel room renovations at our council bluffs and kansas city properties 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in and in the federal income tax statutory rate was in both years 
the differences from the statutory rate are due to state income taxes and the effect of certain expenses we incurred that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
net income net income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and diluted earnings per share increased to in from in our net income and diluted earnings per share in increased primarily as a result of revenue growth for the reasons mentioned above  as partially offset by increases in depreciation expense  corporate costs and losses on early retirement of debt

all our properties improved their net revenues and market share in when compared to led by a million increase in slot revenues  consolidated casino revenues for increased million  or  from the prior year 
we believe that the growth in slot revenues was driven by our continued implementation of coinless slot technology at our ameristar branded properties  which were coinless as of december  in addition  we believe our continued leadership in the introduction of new generation  lower denomination slot machines at our ameristar branded properties has contributed to the improvement in slot revenues  due to the popularity of this segment of the slot market

as of december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
all mandatory principal repayments have been made through december  as discussed above  on november   we obtained a new billion senior secured credit facility that includes a million seven year term loan facility and a five year revolving loan facility with capacity for borrowing up to million 
the proceeds from the new term loan were primarily used to repay all million principal amount of loans outstanding under the replaced senior secured credit facilities 
the new credit facility features lower interest rate add ons compared to our previous senior secured credit facilities and  together with operating cash flows  will provide the funding for our planned capital improvement projects and funded the redemption in february of our senior subordinated notes  which we expect will result in a further significant reduction in our borrowing costs  as discussed below 
the revolving loan facility includes a million letter of credit sub facility and a million swingline loan sub facility 
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  we will have the option to increase the total amount available under the new credit facility by up to an additional million  in the form of incremental term loans or additional borrowings under the revolving facility 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
on february   we redeemed all million outstanding principal amount of the senior subordinated notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus million in accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date

at december   we had available million of state net operating loss carryforwards that relate to our missouri properties and may be applied against future taxable income  including tax payments we are required to make in at december   we also had available million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which were acquired as part of the mountain high acquisition 
these acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to irs change of ownership limitations 
accordingly  the future utilization of 
table of contents the carryforwards is subject to an annual base limitation of million that can be applied against future taxable income 
during the year ended december   we utilized a significant amount of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and began to make substantial cash payments for federal and state income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  we made federal and state income tax payments totaling million and million  respectively 
our cash tax payments for are expected to be approximately million 
as of december   in addition to the million available for borrowing under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
we anticipate spending approximately million on maintenance capital expenditures including the acquisition of slot machines and other long lived assets and approximately million on internal expansion projects 
actual capital expenditures will depend on the start date of certain projects and the progress of construction through year end 
our planned internal expansion projects include the reconfiguration and expansion of the gaming area  which was completed in march  and construction of a room aaa four diamond quality hotel at our mountain high property  the construction of a room  all suite hotel  an indoor outdoor swimming pool  a  square foot full service spa   square feet of new meeting and conference facilities and an additional  space parking garage at ameristar st

we anticipate the benefit associated with these internal growth projects will primarily be realized commencing in and we may experience construction disruption from the projects that will negatively impact our financial results in as mandated by the iowa legislature in  all riverboat casinos in iowa are required to pay a special assessment in and as a result of the law  our council bluffs property paid approximately million in and will pay a similar special assessment in  which are recoverable as a credit against future gaming taxes beginning in historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior credit facilities will be able to support our operations and liquidity requirements  including all of our currently planned capital expenditures and dividend payments on our common stock 
however  if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet such needs  we will be required to seek additional financing or scale back our capital plans 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
our ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facilities at any time is primarily dependent upon the amount of our ebitda  as defined for purposes of our senior credit facilities  for the preceding four fiscal quarters

table of contents contractual and other commitments the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations  capitalized leases  operating leases and certain construction contracts 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations after total long term debt instruments estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases material construction contracts total excludes million discount on long term debt 
estimated interest payments on long term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding after giving effect to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes in february  projected borrowings in and forecasted libor rates for our senior secured credit facilities 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commitments after total letters of credit during  we utilized a significant amount of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and began to make substantial cash payments for income taxes 
we anticipate a continued increase in cash tax payments in however  state net operating loss carryforwards in missouri and colorado will continue to provide credits against taxable income in those jurisdictions through we currently anticipate cash tax payments in to be approximately million 
another significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments  excluding capitalized interest  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our weighted average interest rate is expected to decrease as a result of the refinancing of our senior credit facilities in november and the early retirement of our senior subordinated notes in february however  we will have a larger average outstanding debt balance in due to anticipated borrowings under the million revolving loan facility to fund planned capital improvement projects 
the interest rate savings mentioned above are expected to partially offset the increase in the average outstanding debt balance  which will likely result in a slight increase in cash interest payments in for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 

table of contents during december  we assumed several agreements with the missouri highway transportation development district development district that had been entered into in order to assist the development district in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the ameristar kansas city property prior to our purchase of that property 
in order to pay for the highway improvement project  the development district issued revenue bonds totaling million in principal amount with scheduled maturities from through we have issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a bank in support of obligations of the development district for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds 
the amount outstanding under this letter of credit was million as of december  and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds 
additionally  we are obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds as well as any costs incurred by the development district that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders 
through december   we had paid million in shortfalls and other costs 
as required by the agreements  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the development district from future available cash flow  as defined  and have recorded a corresponding receivable as of december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our senior credit facilities 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at december   we had approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of the missouri properties in december 
table of contents as required by sfas no 
 we completed our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
star awards program our customer reward program  star awards  allows customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were accrued under this program 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
cash coupons our former  current and future gaming customers may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play  are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we utilize actuaries who consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrators of the various programs 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
income taxes we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states and state income taxes in several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 

table of contents our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on historical precedent 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any probable adverse outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no

r  share based payment  which is a revision to sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
among other items  sfas no 
r requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  including employee stock options and restricted stock  granted to employees 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on our results of operations  but it will not have any impact on our overall financial position 
although the precise impact on us of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on various factors  including the number of awards granted and their related fair value at the date of grant  we currently estimate the adoption will result in a non cash expense for of approximately million 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they will depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options

sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no

other than the borrowings under the senior credit facilities at december   all of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
the senior credit facilities bear interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable add on 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by approximately million
