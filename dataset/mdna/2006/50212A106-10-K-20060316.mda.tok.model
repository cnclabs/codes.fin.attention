financial results we generate revenue through the sale and license of products and services for verifying and managing identities 
our revenues decreased slightly to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december   due in large part to a decrease of approximately million in revenues from the us department of defense  primarily stemming from the million one time sale of printer systems in  which was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in revenues from the us department of state under our contract to deliver passports 
our net loss for was million 
our results for include a full year of operating activity from the acquisitions closed during see results of operations below for additional details 
capital raising initiatives and repayment of indebtedness in december  viisage i issued and sold to aston capital partners  lp  or aston  an affiliate of l investment partners llc  or l   shares of viisage common stock at per share and ii issued to aston warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of viisage common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain vesting criteria 
the sale of the shares resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to viisage of million 
under the investment agreement with aston  million of the proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions subject to approval by viisage s board of directors 
in december  our stockholders approved a one for two and a half reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding viisage common stock in connection with their approval of the transactions contemplated by the aston investment agreement 
all per share amounts and outstanding shares  including all common stock equivalents  have been adjusted in this form k for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split 
we expect our current capital resources to be adequate for our needs for at least the next months 
however  if we enter into a material new contract or engage in a significant acquisition or other strategic transaction  we could be required to raise additional capital  either in the form of debt or equity 
acquisitions in november  we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with aston referred to as the assignment agreement under which we agreed to pay million to aston for its previously acquired interest in integrated biometric technology llc  or ibt  a wholly owned subsidiary of integrated biometric technology  inc  or ibt parent  subject to the consummation of the aston investment in viisage and customary closing conditions  and entered into an agreement and plan of merger referred to as the ibt merger agreement with ibt parent  ibt and the stockholders of ibt parent under which we agreed to issue to the stockholders of ibt parent shares of viisage common stock  in the amounts and on the terms described below  for all of the outstanding capital stock of ibt parent 
the only asset of ibt parent at the time of the merger was the interest in ibt not previously acquired by aston 
in december  in accordance with the terms of the assignment agreement  we completed the purchase of of the outstanding membership interests of ibt from aston for million in cash  and in accordance with the terms of the ibt merger agreement  all of the outstanding capital stock of ibt parent was exchanged for  shares of viisage common stock  and ibt parent was merged with and into a subsidiary of viisage  which resulted in ibt parent becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage 
as a result of the two transactions  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of ibt  and ibt is a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage 
the merger agreement provides that the stockholders of ibt parent are eligible to receive from us additional consideration for each share of viisage common stock issued in the merger  equal to the 
table of contents amount  if any  by which or in the event that defined revenues of ibt for the year ended december  exceed million exceeds the average of the closing bid prices of viisage common stock during the month of february  as reported on the nasdaq stock market  in each case as adjusted for any stock splits 
any difference will be paid in additional shares of viisage common stock  provided that if the average of the closing bid prices for viisage common stock during the month of february is less than  the difference to be paid will be determined as if the average price were 
in december  we acquired the autotest division of openshaw media group  a provider of automated web based applicant testing technologies for state departments of motor vehicles and other credential issuing agencies for million in cash 
in february  we acquired securimetrics  inc  a producer of handheld iris recognition and multi modal biometric devices  software applications and services  for million in cash and million in additional consideration contingent on the achievement of certain performance thresholds and the resolution of certain litigation and contingencies  of which million would be paid in shares of viisage common stock at a fixed price of per share 
litigation in march and april  eight putative class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us  bernard c 
bailey  william k 
aulet our former chief financial officer and denis k 
berube and other members of our board of directors 
these lawsuits have been consolidated into one action 
the amended consolidated complaint which was filed in february alleges violations of the federal securities laws by us and certain of our officers and directors arising out of purported misstatements and omissions in our sec filings related to the litigation involving the georgia drivers license contract and related to our reported material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting  which allegedly artificially inflated the price of our stock during the period may  through march  we are not able to estimate the amount of the loss allegedly suffered by members of the putative class or the amount of legal costs and internal efforts associated with defending ourselves and our officers and directors 
in september  securimetrics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage since february  commenced an action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against iridian technologies  inc to obtain a determination of the meaning of disputed terms in a series of interrelated license agreements between securimetrics and iridian regarding certain iris recognition technology owned by iridian 
iridian has asserted counterclaims alleging that securimetrics is in breach of or default under certain provisions of such license agreements 
in december  a georgia court granted summary judgment in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by one of our competitors in march alleging that the dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
as a result of the judge s ruling  in the fourth quarter of  we took a non cash impairment charge of million for assets we purchased to deliver services to dmvs 
our appeal of this ruling to the georgia supreme court was dismissed on procedural grounds in may a complete description of the above matters is provided under item  legal proceedings 
segments and geographic information we operate in two business segments  the advanced technology identity solutions segment and the fingerprint products and services segment  and categorize product and service revenues into three main categories identified by the markets which they serve state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets 
our advanced technology identity solutions segment enables governments  law enforcement agencies 
table of contents and businesses to enhance security  reduce identity theft and protect personal privacy utilizing secure credential provisioning and authentication systems  biometric technology and the creation  enhancement and or utilization of identity databases 
our fingerprint products and services segment provides solutions to government  civil  and commercial customers that require criminal background checks and screening 
our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker who evaluates performance based on revenues and total operating expenses of these segments across all markets and geographic regions 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately  or million of our total revenue from our advanced technology identity solutions segment and  or  from our fingerprint products and services segment as a result of our acquisition of ibt in december we anticipate that this segment will represent a significantly higher percentage of revenues and operating income going forward 
for the year ended december   all of our results of operations were derived from our advanced technology identity solutions segment 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately  or million   or million  and  or million of our total revenue from customers in state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets  respectively 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately  or million   or million  and  or  of our total revenue from customers in the state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets  respectively 
for the year ended december   we derived  or million  of our total revenue within the united states 
we derived an additional  or million  of our total revenue in international markets 
of the million of international sales  approximately million was derived by our german subsidiary  primarily from customers in countries within the european union 
for the year ended december   we derived  or million  of our total revenue within the united states 
we derived an additional  or million  of our total revenue in international markets 
of the million of international sales  approximately million was derived by our german subsidiary  primarily from customers in countries within the european union 
dependence on significant customers we believe for the near future that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
customers who accounted for more than of our total revenues are as follows for the year ended december   one customer accounted for for the year ended december   two customers accounted for an aggregate of  and for the year ended december   two customers accounted for an aggregate of 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap 
consistent with us gaap  we have adopted accounting policies that we believe are most appropriate given the facts and circumstances of our business 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on our reported results 
in addition  some of these policies require management to make assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates  which are based on historical experience and analysis of current conditions  have a significant impact on our reported results and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  revenue recognition  income taxes  litigation and valuation of other financial instruments  including warrants and stock options 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and goodwill 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  million and million  respectively 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that have finite lives  and amortize those assets over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  our management has evaluated the carrying amounts of our identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets  including their estimated useful lives when indicators of impairment are present 
for all long lived tangible and intangible assets  if an impairment loss were identified based on the fair value of the asset  as compared to the carrying amounts of the asset  such loss would be charged to expense in the period we identify the impairment 
furthermore  based on our review of the carrying amounts of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives  we may determine that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate 
in that event  we record depreciation and amortization over fewer future periods  which will reduce our earnings 
factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived tangible and intangible assets were realizable as of december   future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a write down of certain system assets associated with our contract to produce drivers licenses in the state of georgia 
this impairment was the result of a georgia court s grant of summary judgment  during that quarter  in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by one of our competitors in march alleging that the dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
the summary judgment negated a prior settlement between us and the state that would have provided us with a payment of million upon the cancellation of its contract 
due to the uncertainty of the cash settlement as a result of the judge s ruling and the uncertainty of future cash flows from this contract to support the book value of certain system assets installed  we have identified million of assets deployed within the state that we deemed to have no alternative use 
we reduced the recorded amounts of these assets from approximately million to their estimated fair value of approximately  based on our estimate of realizable value from liquidation of these assets  which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of we also have evaluated for impairment the remaining million in assets retained by us from the georgia contract 
these consist of approximately million of assets that we anticipate using in georgia if we win the contract based on the new request for proposals  approximately  of assets that we anticipate could either be used in georgia under a new contract or used in other projects  and approximately million of assets constituting our central production facility in georgia 
based upon our current probability weighted estimate of cash flows  we have determined that these assets are not 
table of contents currently impaired 
while we believe we can utilize these assets either in georgia  if we win the new contract  or on alternative projects  to the extent that we are unable to utilize these assets or realize value through a sale of these assets or reach a new settlement with dmvs regarding these assets  we would be required to record a further charge to earnings 
due to our two acquisitions in and our three acquisitions in  goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses 
the amounts recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets represent estimates of fair values and  with respect to the acquisitions are preliminary and subject to adjustment based on additional analyses of values and as additional information is obtained 
management believes that any differences between the preliminary and final allocations will not be material 
valuations of acquired businesses require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions  which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses  and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property and other sources 
critical estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired brand and intangible assets  and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may not materialize because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be different from actual results  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which it is identified 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the incurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit as determined by considering a number of factors  including an assessment of the fair value of viisage based on a comparison of us to comparable companies using the guideline company method and comparable transaction method 
we also considered future discounted cash flows as compared to the carrying amount to assess the recoverability of the goodwill asset 
based upon these tests  we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount 
revenue historically  revenue was derived primarily of sales from the delivery of personal identification solutions primarily to federal and state government customers  some of which are fulfilled through the delivery of hardware and software licenses  as well as providing software maintenance  technical support  training  
table of contents installation and consulting services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
when a customer arrangement does not require significant production  modification or customization of software or does not contain services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered typically in the form of a signed contract or purchase order 
delivery has occurred for product sales  delivery generally takes place when title to the products  which in certain instances includes hardware and software licenses  are shipped to or accepted by the customer 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to a refund or cancellation and do not exceed standard payment terms 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is creditworthy and collection is probable 
transactions which typically do not involve significant production  modification or customization of software  or do not include services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  include document issuance solutions  primarily to federal and state government customers  printing system components and consumables including printers  secure coating  ribbon  film  and other parts  primarily to federal government customers  licenses of off the shelf versions of face recognition software  services and software to scan  collect  and transmit fingerprints for identity and background verification  and document authentication products and services  which typically include sales of hardware  software  maintenance and support 
revenue on these transactions is generally recognized upon passage of title for product sales  and delivery of services  provided the four revenue criteria listed above are met at that time 
in certain cases  customer acceptance is required  in which case revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is achieved 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
consulting  training and other similar services are typically recognized as the services are performed 
software maintenance  hardware replacement  and technical support for such products  are typically recognized ratably over the contract term  which approximates the timing of the services rendered 
revenue for time and material arrangements is recognized as the services are rendered 
expenses on all services are recognized when the costs are incurred 
revenue from the collection of fingerprints for identity and background verification is recognized when the fingerprint is transmitted to applicable background vetting agency  and is recognized on a gross basis where we are the prime contractor  and on a net basis where we are the subcontractor 
many of our arrangements include multiple elements for which we apply the provisions of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such elements typically include one or more of the following hardware  software licenses  rights to additional software products  software maintenance  hardware replacement  technical support services  training  installation and consulting services 
for multiple element arrangements including software  which do not involve significant modification or customization of the software or services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we allocate value to each element based on its relative fair value  if sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
table of contents exists for each element of the arrangement 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately 
if sufficient vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but does not exist for the delivered element  then the residual method is used to allocate value to each element 
under the residual method  each undelivered element is allocated value based on vsoe of fair value for that element  as described above  and the remainder of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element 
if sufficient vsoe does not exist for all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for any undelivered elements  generally maintenance and support  at which time revenue is recognized for all delivered elements 
revenue for maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the remaining term of any maintenance and support period 
in the case of multiple element arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or involve services that are considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting under sop and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  is applied 
when vsoe of fair value exists for software maintenance or technical support in arrangements requiring contract accounting  the consulting and license fees are combined and revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion basis  and the software maintenance or technical support are typically recognized ratably over the contract term 
in general  transactions which involve significant production  modification or customization of software  or services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  include contracts  generally with state governments for the production of drivers licenses and other identification credentials  for which we have determined that the contract has multiple elements and where the title to equipment installed to produce these credentials does not pass to the customer 
under these contracts  the first element consists of hardware  system design  implementation  training  consumables management  maintenance and support which is accounted for as equipment and related executory services under lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the second element consists of customized software which is accounted for as a long term contract in accordance with sop and sop  for which revenue is recognized on the units of delivery method  and identity solutions contracts  typically providing for the development  customization and installation of face recognition systems for government agencies  law enforcement agencies and businesses 
these contracts are generally fixed price  and include milestones and acceptance criteria for the various deliverables under the contract 
these contracts are accounted for as long term contracts in accordance with sop and sop  and revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion using the cost to cost method 
we use the percentage of completion methodology to account for revenue under these contracts because a high level of certainty exists regarding expected cash flows from these contracts  and a reliable basis exists for estimating the percentage of the contract that is completed at the end of the accounting period 
consulting  training and other similar services for such products are generally recognized along with the product component under the percentage of completion method 
software maintenance  hardware replacement  and technical support for such products  are typically recognized ratably over the contract term  unless provided on a time and material basis  in which case revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
expenses on all services are recognized when the costs are incurred 
for contracts for which revenue is recognized under the units of delivery method  costs related to the hardware element of these contracts are capitalized and are depreciated over the lesser of the contract term or the useful life  beginning when the system goes into service 
the delivery of these credentials typically requires us to customize  design  and install equipment and software at customer locations  as well as perform training  supply consumables  maintain the equipment and provide support services 
nonperformance of training  consumables management  maintenance and support services would prevent receipt of payment for the costs incurred in the 
table of contents customization  design and installation of the system 
eitf limits the amount of revenue allocable to the customization  design and installation of the system to the amount that is not contingent upon the production of credentials 
revenue on these contracts under eitf is earned based on  and is contingent upon  the production of credentials from the system 
due to the contingent performance of credential production in secure credentials contracts  we defer revenue recognition for the system design and installation phase of such contracts  including customized software and equipment  and recognize revenue as credentials are produced 
costs related to the customized software used in drivers license contracts are capitalized during the period in which we are designing and installing the system and are amortized over the contract term beginning when the system goes into service 
our contracts related to the delivery of drivers licenses and identification credentials typically provide that the state department of transportation  or similar agency  will pay a fixed price per credential produced utilizing a system that we design  implement and support 
our fixed pricing includes charges for the use of the system  materials  and the data that is stored on the credentials 
prices under these contracts vary depending on  among other things design and integration complexities  nature and number of workstations and sites installed  projected number of secure credentials to be produced  size of the database  level of post installation involvement that will be required of us  and competitive environment 
under the percentage of completion  we measure the percentage complete using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones  whichever provides the most reliable and meaningful measure of performance 
milestones are specific events or deliverables clearly identified in the contract and can include delivering customized systems  installation and services as defined by the contract 
when milestone measures are used  billings occur and revenue is recognized when performance milestones and customer acceptance criteria have been achieved 
we recognize revenue based on the total milestone billable to the customer less revenue related to any future maintenance requirements 
on contracts where milestones are not used  we generally recognize revenue on a cost to cost basis using direct labor dollars method 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
we record costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under these contracts as current assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of net deferred tax assets  we have provided a full valuation allowance against this amount 
we had a deferred income tax provision in and of approximately million and  respectively  to record the deferred tax liability related to the amortization of tax deductible goodwill  for which the period the temporary difference will reverse is indefinite 
deferred tax liabilities do not offset deductible temporary differences that create deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  we made an election under internal revenue tax code section h to treat the acquisition of 
table of contents tdt as an asset transaction for tax purposes 
on december   we acquired ibt in a transaction accounted for as a partial acquisition of assets 
these transactions resulted in tax deductible amortization expense related to goodwill for tax purposes 
there was no provision for federal income taxes for the year ended december  due to the net losses in that year 
comprehensive income loss in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  we report accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
comprehensive loss includes net loss and other comprehensive loss  which includes current period foreign currency translation adjustments 
the accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of unrealized translation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translations 
we had approximately million and  of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december  and december   respectively 
other comprehensive loss for the year ended december  was comprised solely of our net loss 
stock based compensation we account for our employees stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  utilizing the intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
we have adopted the disclosure only alternative under sfas no 
for its employees stock based compensation awards  which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share as if sfas no 
had been adopted as well as certain other information 
as discussed below  the company will adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment  in our first quarter of fiscal derivative instruments and hedging activities in  viisage began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts for specific purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
all gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings 
none of the contracts were terminated prior to settlement 
as of december   viisage had committed to two foreign currency forward contracts to purchase approximately  japanese yen for approximately  the fair value of these contracts at december  was approximately  all of these contracts have since been settled

inflation although some of our expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results to date 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances

to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  and will be effective in our first quarter of fiscal as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock option grants or the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will significantly increase our recognized employee compensation expense  thereby reducing net income and earnings per share 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
 which would have resulted in us reporting a net loss of approximately million  or per basic and diluted share  instead of million  or per basic and diluted share 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current guidance 
this requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future 
in december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
is based on the principle that exchange of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair market value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on viisage s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim 
table of contents financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have an immediate material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no
