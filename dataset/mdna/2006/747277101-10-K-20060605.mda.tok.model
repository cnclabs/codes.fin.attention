acquisitions and dispositions in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business  or the business  to marvell technology group ltd 
marvell for cash and shares of marvell s common stock 
we received million in cash  including a million purchase price adjustment due to inventory levels on the date of closing  and  shares of marvell s common stock valued at million 
table of contents based upon the market price of the shares received on the closing date 
we recorded a gain on the sale of the business of million  net of million of income taxes 
as a result of this transaction  all current and prior period financial information related to the business has been presented as discontinued operations 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the business and amounts related to the business unless otherwise noted 
also in november  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of troika networks  inc troika for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the assets acquired included intellectual property including patents and trademarks  inventory and property and equipment 
troika developed  marketed and sold a storage services platform that hosted third party software solutions 
we expect the acquisition of troika to expand our product line and the acquired intellectual property to enhance certain of our current products and provide greater functionality to our customers 
the consideration paid in excess of the fair market value of the tangible assets acquired totaled million 
based on a preliminary purchase price allocation  we have recorded goodwill of million and core technology of million  which are included in goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of april   and recognized a charge of million for purchased in process research and development  or ipr d 
we expect to finalize the purchase price allocation in fiscal  which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded in fiscal in addition  we entered into a performance plan with certain former troika employees upon their employment with qlogic 
the performance plan provides for the issuance of stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plan  we could recognize compensation expense of up to million over four years 
on april   we acquired all outstanding shares of pathscale  inc pathscale 
pathscale designs and develops system area network fabric interconnects targeted at high performance clustered system environments 
the acquisition of pathscale expands our portfolio of solutions to include infiniband  a high performance low latency switched fabric interconnect 
consideration paid for this acquisition was approximately million in cash  which included the purchase of all vested pathscale stock options 
in addition  we converted unvested pathscale stock options for continuing employees into options to purchase approximately  shares of qlogic common stock with a weighted average exercise price of 
the total fair value of the converted options is approximately million and will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining service period 
we are in the process of evaluating the net assets acquired and expect to finalize the purchase price allocation during fiscal the consideration paid in excess of the fair market value of tangible assets acquired is expected to be allocated to intangible assets  goodwill and ipr d 
to the extent a portion of the purchase price is allocated to ipr d  we will recognize a charge to operating expenses for such amount 
we also entered into a performance plan with certain former pathscale shareholders who became employees of qlogic 
the performance plan provides for the issuance of stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plan  we could recognize compensation expense of up to million over four years 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  our net revenues from continuing operations increased from the prior year to million and were highlighted by a increase in revenues from san infrastructure products  which are comprised of hbas  switches and silicon chips 
income from continuing operations increased from the prior year to million  or per diluted share 
net income  including the results of discontinued operations and the gain on sale of the discontinued operations  was million or per diluted share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our net revenues from continuing operations were million  a increase from the third quarter of fiscal revenues from san infrastructure products during the fourth quarter increased sequentially from the third quarter and represented of our total net revenues 

table of contents in our continuing effort to be more responsive and increase customer satisfaction  we established operations in ireland during the first quarter of fiscal as a key element of our expanded global supply chain program  the ireland operations are expected to deliver customer specific configure on demand services  regionally based customer support  order fulfillment services and reverse logistics for our international customers 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we commenced shipments to customers from our ireland facility 
in march  we completed a two for one stock split through the payment of a stock dividend to holders of record of our common stock on february  a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased sequentially by million  or  from million in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in the fourth quarter  a decrease from for the third quarter of fiscal we continue to expect downward pressure on our gross profit percentage as a result of changes in product and technology mix  as well as declining average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to in the third quarter of fiscal operating income for the fourth quarter was impacted by a million charge for purchased in process research and development related to our acquisition of troika 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and decreased slightly from the million  or per diluted share  reported in the third quarter of fiscal income from continuing operations was impacted by the purchased in process research and development charge noted above  which was partially offset by an million gain on the sale of a portion of the shares of marvell common stock acquired as part of the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at april  decreased million from million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal primarily due to income tax payments related to the gain on sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we generated million of cash from continuing operating activities 
accounts receivable was million as of april   compared to million as of january  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of april  decreased to days from days as of january  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by linearity of shipments within the quarter and collections performance 
based on our customers procurement models and our current customer mix  we expect that dso in the future will range from to days 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our dso consistent with historical trends and it may increase in the future 
inventories were million as of april   compared to million as of january  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal of turns decreased from the turns in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in inventories was principally due to our customers slower than expected transition to new or enhanced hba products  including rohs compliant products 

table of contents results of operations net revenues a summary of the components of our net revenues is as follows in millions net revenues san infrastructure products management controllers other total net revenues percentage of net revenues san infrastructure products management controllers other total net revenues the global marketplace for sans continues to expand in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise business environments  as well as the emerging market for san based solutions for small and medium sized businesses 
this market expansion has resulted in increased volume shipments of our san infrastructure products 
however  the san market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenues have generally been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion  increases in market share and the release of new products 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining average selling prices 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of san infrastructure products and management controllers 
other revenue includes non product related revenues  such as royalties  non recurring engineering fees and service fees 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from san infrastructure products  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in revenue from management controllers 
the increase in revenue from san infrastructure products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of fibre channel and iscsi hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of fibre channel and iscsi hbas  and a increase in the quantity of switches sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of switches 
the decrease in revenue from management controllers was due to a decrease in the quantity sold and a decrease in average selling prices 
we expect revenue from management controllers to decrease over time  as these products are not part of our core business and we are not investing in the development of new products 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue 
other revenues are unpredictable and we do not expect them to be significant to our overall revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal  principally due to a million  or  increase in revenue from san infrastructure products  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in revenue from management controllers 
the increase in revenue from san infrastructure products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of fibre channel and iscsi hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of fibre channel and iscsi hbas 
the decrease in revenue from management controllers was due to a decrease in the quantity sold and an decrease in average selling prices 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue  compared to million in fiscal a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the 
table of contents foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented is as follows ibm hewlett packard sun microsystems dell computer less than of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination 
no individual country other than the united states represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and japan rest of world gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  and costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and declined from in the prior year 
the decline in gross profit percentage was principally due to an unfavorable shift in product and technology mix  as well as a decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and increased from in the prior year 
this gross profit percentage increase was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin products and cost efficiencies realized from the increase in production during fiscal our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs  the worldwide 
table of contents semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
also  royalty revenues have been and continue to be unpredictable 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  development related engineering and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount for our expanded development efforts in support of new products  including an increase in headcount due to the acquisition of troika during the third quarter of fiscal  a million increase in external engineering costs associated with new product development  a million increase in equipment and supplies costs  and million of non cash compensation charges related to the acquisition of troika  partially offset by a reduction of million of non cash compensation charges incurred during fiscal related to the acquisition of the little mountain group  inc the non cash charges related to the little mountain group acquisition ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from million for fiscal engineering and development expenses increased primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount for our expanded development efforts in support of new products  a million increase in external engineering costs associated with new product development and a million increase in equipment and supplies costs  partially offset by a million reduction in the non cash compensation charges related to the acquisition of the little mountain group 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
we expect engineering and development expenses will continue to increase in the future as a result of continued and increasing costs associated with new product development  including the acquisitions of troika and pathscale 

table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million increase in various promotional activities directed at increasing market awareness and acceptance of our products  a million increase in the compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  a million increase in commissions expense as a result of higher revenues and a million increase in travel related expenses 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups and a million increase in various promotional activities 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal and included an increase of million in outside consulting services  primarily related to the structuring of our expanded international operations  partially offset by a million reimbursement received from an insurance carrier related to the settlement of a prior legal matter and a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal included million related to legal settlements  which did not recur in fiscal in addition  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased by million for increases in compensation and related benefit costs 
in connection with the growth of our business  we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in the future 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of troika  we recognized a charge of million for ipr d  based on a preliminary purchase price allocation 
ipr d was expensed because the technological feasibility of the product under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
one ipr d project was identified  which related to the development of a new product 
as of the date of the acquisition  the project was estimated to be more than complete and is expected to be completed in fiscal the fair value of the ipr d was valued utilizing the income approach which estimates expected future after tax cash flows of the project under development and discounts its net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
we expect to finalize the purchase price allocation in fiscal  which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded in fiscal we are in the process of evaluating the net assets acquired in the pathscale transaction and expect to finalize the purchase price allocation during fiscal to the extent a portion of the purchase price is allocated to ipr d  we will recognize a charge to operating expenses for such amount in fiscal 
table of contents non operating income a summary of the components of our interest and other income are as follows in millions interest income gain loss on sale of marketable securities other interest and other income for fiscal of million is comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of marketable securities 
interest income increased by million due to increasing yields on our portfolio of marketable securities  as well as larger investment balances 
interest and other income for fiscal also includes an million gain on the sale of a portion of the shares of marvell common stock acquired as part of the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business  partially offset by million of realized losses on sales of marketable securities 
during fiscal  interest and other income of million is comprised principally of interest income related to our portfolio of marketable securities 
the million increase in interest income in fiscal from the prior year was due to increasing yields as well as higher investment balances 
interest and other income in fiscal also included realized losses on sales of marketable securities of million  compared to million of gains on sales of marketable securities in the prior year 
income taxes our effective income tax rate related to continuing operations approximated in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to investments by foreign subsidiaries in intellectual property rights previously held by the united states parent and in newly acquired intellectual property rights  investment in foreign operations and the continued reduction in benefits derived from both the extraterritorial income exclusion and research credits 
the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the favorable resolution of routine tax examinations 
during fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to benefit from our transfer of intellectual property rights to foreign subsidiaries and investments in foreign operations 
however  our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the tax effects of acquisitions  including the acquisition of pathscale  and the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  given the increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within each tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  we may not achieve our expectations for our effective tax rate 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business to marvell technology group ltd 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a gain on sale before income taxes of million 

table of contents income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  consists of direct revenues and direct expenses of the business  including cost of revenues  as well as other fixed and allocated costs to the extent that such costs were eliminated as a result of the transaction 
general corporate overhead costs have not been allocated to discontinued operations 
a summary of the operating results of the business included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is as follows in millions net revenues income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes as the sale of the business closed on november   net revenues and income from discontinued operations for fiscal do not include a full year of operating activity 
net revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal and income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for fiscal decreased by million  or 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal and income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for fiscal increased by million  or  from the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have decreased to million at april   compared to million at april  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase programs and the acquisition of troika  partially offset by our cash generated by continuing operations and the cash received from the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments and cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including changes in the markets we address  our revenues and the related manufacturing and operating costs  product development efforts and requirements for production capacity 
in order to fund any additional capital requirements  we may seek to obtain debt financing or issue additional shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if necessary  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our income from continuing operations of million  net non cash charges depreciation and amortization  ipr d  deferred income taxes and other of million  and a net increase in the non cash components of our working capital of million 
the increase in the non cash components of working capital was primarily due to a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable and an increase of million in other assets  all associated with the expansion of our business 
the increase in the non cash components of working capital were partially offset by an increase of million in operating liabilities due to the timing of payment obligations 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal consists of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases of  offset by net cash paid for the acquisition of troika of million  additions to property and equipment of million and million of cash placed in escrow under the terms of the agreement with marvell for the sale of the business 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities of million included additions to property and equipment of million and the purchase of other assets of million  partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases of million 

table of contents subsequent to year end  we paid approximately million to acquire pathscale 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal resulted from our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
during fiscal  the million of cash used in financing activities resulted from the use of million for the purchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million for fiscal and included million of net proceeds from the sale of the business offset by million of net cash used in discontinued operating activities  which was primarily due to income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the business 
future cash flows from discontinued operations are not expected to be significant 
our board of directors approved stock repurchase programs i in october  that authorized us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock  ii in june  that authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock  iii in august  that authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock  and iv in november  that authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased the remaining million available under the june plan  consisting of million shares  repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million under the august plan  and repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million under the november plan 
since fiscal  we have repurchased a total of million of our common stock under programs authorized by our board of directors 
we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of april   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors when the product is sold by the distributor to a third party 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our distributor customers and account for such programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we account for our competitive pricing incentives  which generally reflect front end price adjustments  as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale  and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs and rebates in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns and allowance programs 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to market value for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record liabilities for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of 
table of contents regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent management believes that recovery is more likely than not  we do not establish a valuation allowance 
an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models eg black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we expect to utilize the modified prospective transition alternative in adopting sfas no 
r 
under this method  compensation cost would be recognized in financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  for us  fiscal 
the adoption of the sfas no 
r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in fiscal through fiscal related to share based awards unvested at april   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas no 
 is approximately million 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate or adjust any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional stock based awards to employees or assume unvested stock based awards in connection with any acquisitions  stock based compensation expense will be increased by those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional stock based awards in fiscal the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of stock based awards granted and the then current fair values 
we currently estimate that  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our consolidated statements of income would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as illustrated in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in 
table of contents the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in fiscal  and related to such excess tax deductions was million  million and million  respectively 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position fas fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsp 
the fsp provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
the fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of the fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a marketable securities investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our credit exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we also hold shares of marvell common stock that were received in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
the shares of marvell common stock are equity securities and  as such  inherently have higher risk than the marketable securities in which we usually invest 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of april   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
with the exception of the marvell common stock noted above  our short term investment portfolio consists primarily of marketable debt securities  including government securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  asset and mortgage backed securities  and other debt securities  which principally have remaining terms of three years or less 
consequently  such securities are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  as of april   unrealized losses of million net of related income taxes on these securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
