overview during  net interest income declined to  from  in  and net income declined to  from  in in the company saw continued growth in both deposits and the loan portfolio 
non interest bearing deposits increased by  and interest bearing deposits declined by  the loan portfolio increased by  primarily due to a  increase in commercial mortgage loans 
all per share amounts throughout this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to a six for five stock dividend paid on january  comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and general 
for the year ended december   the company reported consolidated net income of  basic and diluted earnings per share compared to consolidated net income of  basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  and consolidated net income of  basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  net interest income 
the primary component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets 
net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income  divided by average interest earning assets  represents the company s net interest margin 
net interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the bank s loan portfolio 
currently a majority of the bank s loans are mortgage and construction loans secured by real estate and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles 
these types of loans are made at interest rates lower than unsecured loans 
while the bank s loan volume increased in and  these rate changes produced lower yields on the company s interest earning assets 
meanwhile  current market forces have resulted in higher rates of interest being paid by the bank on deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets 
in  the company intends to increase the bank s commercial loan portfolio and reduce the bank s indirect automobile loan portfolio  which management expects will result in a higher average return on the loan portfolio 
consolidated net interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  decrease for the most recent year was primarily due to an increase in deposit expense  partially offset by an increase in loan income

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments off balance sheet arrangements 
the bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  accordingly  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral or other security obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions  us treasury securities  other marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  personal residences  income producing commercial properties  and land under development 
personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
as of december   the bank has accrued  for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  which is included in other liabilities 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements

the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in in thousands one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total loan commitments other mortgage loans construction land development unused lines of credit home equity lines commercial lines unsecured consumer lines letters of credit market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the bank s asset liability and risk management committee oversees the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies in its management of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period 
these efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the company as well as the asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
the following table sets forth the bank s interest rate sensitivity at december  months over to months over through years over years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks federal funds and overnight deposits securities loans fixed assets other assets total assets liabilities demand deposit accounts now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts ira accounts certificates of deposit other liabilities junior subordinated debenture stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a of total assets the foregoing analysis assumes that the bank s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity 
certificates of deposit and ira accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity 
now savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates 
in addition to gap analysis  the bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus basis point change in rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model and  in the bank s experience  the changes historically realized have been narrower than those projected by the model 
however  the bank believes that the model is a prudent forecasting tool 
as of december   the model produced the following sensitivity profile for net interest income and the economic value of equity 
immediate change in rates basis points basis points basis points basis points change in net interest income change in economic value of equity liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of the bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the bank 
the bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income  deposits from its primary market area  principal and interest payments on loans  interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities 
its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits 
deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the bank s lending and investment activities 
the bank also uses borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta to supplement deposits  residential and small business lending  and to meet specific and anticipated needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are cash on hand  amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold and money market mutual funds 
the levels of such assets are dependent on the bank s operating financing and investment activities at any given time 
the variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows 
cash and cash equivalents cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  and federal funds sold  as of december   totaled  an increase of  or  from the december  total of  most of this increase was due to interest bearing deposits in fhlb 
as of december   the bank was permitted to draw on a million line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the bank s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of us government and agency securities 
as of december   a million long term convertible advance was outstanding under this line 
in addition the bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn 
furthermore  on september   the company issued  of its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to glen burnie statutory trust i  a connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the company 
the trust  in turn  issued  of its capital securities to institutional investors 
the debentures are scheduled to mature on september   unless called by the company not earlier than september  as of december   the full  was outstanding 
federal banking regulations require the company and the bank to maintain specified levels of capital 
at december   the company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under fdic regulations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in mature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  starting on page f and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed there  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process allowance for credit losses 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur  including historical losses as an indicator of future losses  fair market value of collateral  and various general or industry or geographic specific economic events 
the use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for credit losses under item business of this annual report 
accrued taxes 
management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position

sfas r is effective for the company on january  the company will transition to fair value based accounting for stock based compensation using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  as it is applicable to the company  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that are outstanding as of january  must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of and or the periods after the adoption of sfas r 
the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
the company may expect to recognize additional pre tax  quarterly compensation costs beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas r if additional options are issued 
future levels of compensation cost recognized related to stock based compensation awards including the aforementioned expected costs during the period of adoption may be impacted by new awards and or modifications  repurchases and cancellations of existing awards before and after the adoption of this standard 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsb  the meaning of other than temporaryimpairment and its application to certain investments
