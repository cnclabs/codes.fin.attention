as of march   we owned and operated franchises in the united states and franchises outside of the us  primarily in the united kingdom 
we offer a full range of vehicle brands  with of our total revenue in generated from the sales of foreign brands such as bmw  honda  lexus  mercedes and toyota 
sales relating to premium brands  such as audi  bmw  cadillac and porsche  represented of our total revenue

our results for the year ended december  include million million after tax  or per share  of earnings attributable to the sale of all the remaining variable profits relating to the pool of extended service contracts sold at our dealerships over the past five years  and million million after tax  or per share of severance charges 
in addition  results include an million million after tax  or per share  gain resulting from the sale of an investment and an million million after tax  or per share  gain resulting from a refund of uk consumption taxes 
these gains were offset in part by non cash charges of million million after tax  or per share  principally in connection with the planned relocation of certain uk franchises as part of our ongoing facility enhancement program 
new vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers and leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of third party extended service contracts  other third party insurance policies  and fees for facilitating the sale of third party finance and lease contracts as well as the sale of certain other products 

table of contents service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair  maintenance and collision services  the sale of replacement parts and the sale of aftermarket accessories 
we and sirius satellite radio inc sirius have agreed to jointly promote sirius satellite radio service 
pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with sirius  our domestic dealerships endeavor to order a significant percentage of eligible vehicles with a factory installed sirius radio 
we and sirius have also agreed to jointly market the sirius service under a best efforts arrangement 
our costs relating to such marketing initiatives are expensed as incurred 
as compensation for our efforts  we received warrants to purchase ten million shares of sirius common stock at per share in that are earned ratably on an annual basis through january two million of these warrants were earned in each of and in and which vested in the first quarter of and  respectively 
we exercised the warrants and sold the underlying stock we received upon vesting 
the earning of these warrants may be accelerated based on us attaining specified subscription targets 
we measure the fair value of the warrants earned ratably on the date they are earned as there are no significant disincentives for non performance 
since we can reasonably estimate the number of warrants that will be earned pursuant to the ratable schedule  the estimated fair value based on current fair value of these warrants is being recognized ratably during each annual period 
we also received an additional ten million warrants to purchase sirius common stock at per share which are earned upon our sale of certain units pertaining to specified brands 
we earned  of these warrants in since we cannot reasonably estimate the number of warrants that will be earned subject to the sale of certain units pertaining to specified brands  the fair value of these warrants is being recognized when they are earned 
the value of sirius stock has been and is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations  which may result in variability in the amount we earn under this arrangement 
the warrants may be cancelled if certain performance targets are not met or upon the termination of our arrangement 
we may not be able to achieve any of the performance targets outlined in the warrants 
our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and service and parts 
our gross profit generally varies across product lines  with vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other revenues resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 
our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  rent  insurance  utilities and other outside services 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable  and a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  allowing us to adjust them over time to reflect economic trends 
floor plan interest expense relates to indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
we have acquired a number of dealerships each year since our inception 
our financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired dealerships from the date of acquisition 
we have also sold certain dealerships which have been treated as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
the future success of our business will likely be dependent on  among other things  our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions  our ability to increase sales of higher margin products  especially service and parts services  our ability to realize returns on our significant capital investment in new and upgraded dealerships  and the success of our foreign operations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve making estimates and employing judgments 
such judgments influence the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized in our financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews these estimates and assumptions 
management may determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are required  which may result in a material change in our results of operations or financial position 
the following are the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition vehicle  parts and service sales we record revenue when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the customer  when vehicle service or repair work is performed and when parts are delivered to our customers 
sales promotions that we offer to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales at the time of sale 
rebates and other incentives offered directly to us by manufacturers are recognized as earned 
finance and insurance sales we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rates charged to customers and the interest rates set by the financing institution or a flat fee 
we also receive commissions for facilitating the sale of various third party insurance products to customers  including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts 
these commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay or fail to pay their contract  thereby terminating the contract 
customers may also terminate extended service contracts  which are fully paid at purchase  and become eligible for refunds of unused premiums 
in these circumstances  a portion of the commissions we receive may be charged back to us based on the relevant terms of the contracts 
the revenue we record relating to commissions is net of an estimate of the amount of chargebacks we will be required to pay 
such estimate of chargeback exposure is based on our historical experience with similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on extended service contracts and other insurance products 
intangible assets and impairment testing our principal intangible assets relate to our franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers  which represent the estimated value of franchises acquired in business combinations  and goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations 
intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we believe the franchise values of our dealerships have an indefinite useful life based on the following facts automotive retailing is a mature industry and is based on franchise agreements with the vehicle manufacturers  there are no known changes or events that would alter the automotive retailing franchise environment  certain franchise agreement terms are indefinite  franchise agreements that have limited terms have historically been renewed without substantial cost  and our history shows that manufacturers have not terminated franchise agreements 

table of contents impairment testing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
franchise value impairment is assessed through a comparison of the net book values of our franchises with their estimated fair values 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying value of a franchise exceeds its estimated fair value and an impairment loss may be recognized 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our franchises in connection with the annual impairment testing to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives 
goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to a reporting unit is determined to exceed its estimated fair value and an impairment loss may be recognized 
the fair value of the goodwill attributable to the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions regarding revenue and profitability growth  residual values and our cost of capital 
if future events and circumstances cause significant changes in the underlying assumptions and result in a reduction of our estimates of fair value  we may incur an impairment charge 
investments investments include marketable securities and investments in businesses accounted for under the equity method 
marketable securities include investments in debt and equity securities 
marketable securities held by us are typically classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value on our balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary would be an indicator of impairment and may result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
a majority of our investments are in joint venture relationships that are more fully described in joint venture relationships below 
such joint venture relationships are accounted for under the equity method  pursuant to which we record our proportionate share of the joint venture s income each period 
self insurance we retain risk relating to certain of our general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and employee medical benefits in the united states 
as a result  we are likely to be responsible for a majority of the claims and losses incurred under these programs 
the amount of risk we retain varies by program  and  for certain exposures  we have pre determined maximum exposure limits for certain insurance periods 
the majority of losses  if any  above the pre determined exposure limits are paid by third party insurance carriers 
our estimate of future losses is prepared by management using our historical loss experience and industry based development factors 
income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return  and some are timing differences  such as the timing of depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax effect in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent expenses recognized in our financial statements which have not yet been recognized as an expense in our tax return or deductions taken on our tax return that have not yet been recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to allow for the use of the deduction or credit

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  inventory financing  the acquisition of new dealerships  the improvement and expansion of existing facilities  the construction of new facilities and dividends 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements  the issuance of debt securities  sale leaseback transactions or the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash available to fund our operations and capital commitments 
in addition  we had million and million million available for borrowing under our us credit agreement and our us credit agreement  respectively  each of which are discussed below 
we paid dividends of eleven cents per share on march   june  and august  and twelve cents per share on december  and march  future quarterly or other cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  restrictions on any then existing indebtedness and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
we have grown primarily through the acquisition of automotive dealerships 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent we pursue additional significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
we may not have sufficient availability under our credit agreements to finance significant additional acquisitions 
in certain circumstances  a public equity offering could require the prior approval of certain automobile manufacturers 
in connection with any potential significant acquisitions  there is no assurance that we would be able to access the capital markets or increase our borrowing capabilities on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
inventory financing we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan notes payable with various lenders 
in the us  the floor plan arrangements are due on demand  however  we are generally not required to make loan principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles financed 
we typically make monthly interest payments on the amount financed 
in the uk  substantially all of our floor plan arrangements are payable on demand or have an original maturity of days or less and we are generally required to repay floor plan advances at the earlier of the sale of the vehicles financed or the stated maturity

 statement of cash flows 

table of contents we believe that changes in aggregate floor plan liabilities are directly linked to changes in vehicle inventory and  therefore  are an integral part of understanding changes in our working capital and operating cash flow

table of contents contractual payment obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of any relevant agreements 
future events  including acquisitions  divestitures  entering into new operating lease agreements  the amount of borrowings under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements and purchases or refinancing of our securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts

c entity is consolidated in our financial statements d entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience periods of decline and recession similar to those experienced by the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
the greatest us seasonality exists at the dealerships we operate in northeastern and upper mid western states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
our uk operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk the service and parts business at all dealerships experiences relatively modest seasonal fluctuations 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation rates over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 

table of contents we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which generally can be identified by the use of terms such as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  estimate  potential  continue or variations of such terms 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are not assurances of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors  which are incorporated by reference into this item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
outstanding balances under our us and us credit agreements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over defined libor 
based on the amount outstanding as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over defined libor or prime rates 
we continually evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
we are currently party to a swap agreement pursuant to which a notional million of our floating rate floor plan debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through january based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments during  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt  but  with respect to such fixed rate instruments  do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we have dealership operations in the uk and germany 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to our intent to remain permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our foreign operations  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million change to our revenues for the year ended december  in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
