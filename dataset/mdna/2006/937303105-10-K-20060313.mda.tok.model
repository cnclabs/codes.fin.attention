growth strategy the company s strategy is one of value added growth 
management believes that qualitative and sustainable growth of the company  coupled with maintaining profitability  is currently the most appropriate path to providing good value for its shareholders 
to date  the company s growth has been achieved organically and it attributes its reputation for focusing on customer service and satisfaction as one of the cornerstones to the company s success 
the company s primary objectives are to improve profitability and operating efficiencies  increase market penetration in areas currently served  and to continue an expansion strategy in appropriate market areas 
the company s geographical expansion to date has primarily been concentrated along the i corridor from snohomish to whatcom counties  however  additional areas will be considered if they meet the company s criteria 
acquisition of banks or branches may also be used as a means of expansion if appropriate opportunities are presented 
the primary factors considered in determining the areas of geographic expansion are the availability of knowledgeable personnel  such as managers and lending officers with experience in their fields of expertise  longstanding community presence and extensive banking relationships  customer demand and perceived market potential 
management believes that increasing the success of current branches and expanding into appropriate market places while managing up front costs is an excellent way to build franchise value and increase business 
the company s strategy is to support its employees in providing a high level of personal service to its customers while expanding the loan  deposit and investment products and other services that the company offers 
maintenance of asset quality will be emphasized by controlling nonperforming assets and adhering to prudent underwriting standards 
in addition  management will maintain its focus on improving operating efficiencies and internal operating systems to further manage noninterest expense 
growth requires expenditures of substantial sums to purchase or lease real property and equipment and to hire experienced personnel 
new branch offices are often not profitable for a period of time after opening and management expects that earnings may be negatively affected in the short term 
market areas the company s primary market area currently consists of island  skagit  whatcom  snohomish and san juan counties in northwest washington state 
although the pacific northwest is typically associated with industries such as computer technology  aerospace and coffee  the company s market encompasses distinct economies that are somewhat removed from the seattle metropolitan region 
island county s largest population center  oak harbor  is dominated by a large military presence with naval operations at nas whidbey island 
the jobs generated by nas whidbey contribute significantly to the county s economy 
other primary industries providing employment for county residents are education  health and social services  retail trade  and manufacturing 
due to its natural beauty  the county attracts tourism and has a number of retirement communities 

table of contents the economy of skagit county is primarily comprised of agriculture  fishing  wood products  tourism  international trade  and specialized manufacturing 
with its accessible ports and refineries  skagit county is the center of the state s petroleum industry 
whatcom county  which borders canada  has an economy with a prominent manufacturing base  as well as a significant academic research and vocational technical base  as it is the home of western washington university  one of washington s largest four year academic centers 
the united states customs and border patrol and municipal  county and state governments give whatcom county an additional employment base 
snohomish county is one of the fastest growing areas in the state 
industrial sectors include aerospace  biotechnology  and electronics  as well as a military naval base and large retail influences 
the economy of san juan county is predominantly comprised of retail trade  tourism  finance and insurance  and real estate services 
the county is known for its beautiful locale  which attracts many visitors  and serves as a second home to an affluent sector of the population 
washington state s economy has rebounded from the low employment levels experienced in  with recent employment growth being the strongest in five years 
construction employment and sales of building materials were strong as the housing market remained robust through most of even as mortgage rates drift higher  they are still relatively low by historical standards  and washington state population continues to rise 
the large military bases located in the company s region continue to have a positive economic impact 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive banking environment  competing for deposits  loans and other financial services with a number of larger and well established commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions and other institutions  including nonbanking financial services companies 
some of the bank s competitors are not subject to the same regulations as the bank  they may have substantially higher lending limits  and may offer certain services that the bank does not provide 
federal law allows mergers or other combinations  relocations of a bank s main office and branching across state lines 
recent amendments to the federal banking laws to eliminate certain barriers between banking and commercial firms are expected to result in even greater competition in the future 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market areas to date  there can be no assurance that the company s competitive efforts will continue to be successful

gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act 
congress enacted major federal financial institution reform legislation in title i of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act  which became effective march   allows bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding 
table of contents companies 
in addition to activities previously permitted bank holding companies  financial holding companies may engage in nonbanking activities that are financial in nature  such as securities  insurance and merchant banking activities  subject to certain limitations 
the activities of bank holding companies  such as the company that are not financial holding companies  are generally limited to managing or controlling banks 
a bank holding company is required to obtain the prior approval of the frb for the acquisition of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company 
nonbank acquisitions by bank holding companies such as the company are generally limited to of voting shares of a company and activities previously determined by the frb by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks 
the glb act also included the most extensive consumer privacy provisions ever enacted by congress 
these provisions  among other things  require full disclosure of the company s privacy policy to consumers and mandate offering the consumer the ability to opt out of having non public personal information disclosed to third parties 
pursuant to these provisions  the federal banking regulators have adopted privacy regulations 
in addition  the states are permitted to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or regulation 
the company does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its customers or former customers to anyone  except as permitted by law 
additional legislation may be enacted or regulations imposed to further regulate banking and financial services or to limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in such activities 
there can be no assurance whether any such legislation or regulation will place additional limitations on the company s operations or adversely affect its earnings 
there are various legal restrictions on transactions between the company and any nonbank subsidiaries  and between the company and the bank 
with certain exceptions  federal law also imposes limitations on  and requires collateral for  extensions of credit by insured depository institutions  such as the bank  to their nonbank affiliates  such as the company 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
subject to certain limitations and restrictions  a bank holding company  with prior approval of the frb  may acquire an out of state bank 
banks in states that do not prohibit out of state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
a state bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is expressly permitted by the other state 
federal and state bank regulation 
among other things  applicable federal and state statutes and regulations which govern a bank s activities relate to minimum capital requirements  required reserves against deposits  investments  loans  legal lending limits  mergers and consolidations  borrowings  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  establishment of branches and other aspects of its operations 
the division and the fdic also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices 
specifically with regard to the payment of dividends  there are certain limitations on the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders 
it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions also limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
additionally  depending upon the circumstances  the fdic or the division could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 

table of contents under longstanding frb policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks 
the company could be required to commit resources to the bank in circumstances where it might not do so  absent such policy 
the bank is required to file periodic reports with the fdic and the division and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities 
these examinations must be conducted every months 
the fdic and the division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
in the liquidation or other resolution of a failed insured depository institution  deposits in offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims  including nondeposit claims  and claims of a parent company such as the company 
such priority creditors would include the fdic  which succeeds to the position of insured depositors 
capital adequacy 
the company and the bank are subject to risk based capital and leverage guidelines issued by federal banking agencies for banks and bank holding companies 
these agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards 
as of december   the company and the bank exceeded the minimum capital standards 
sarbanes oxley act of the company is also subject to the periodic reporting  information disclosure  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the securities exchange act of  including provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of usa patriot act of under the usa patriot act of patriot act  adopted by the us congress on october  to combat terrorism  fdic insured banks and commercial banks are required to increase their due diligence efforts for correspondent accounts and private banking customers 
the patriot act requires the bank to engage in additional record keeping or reporting  requiring identification of owners of accounts  or of the customers of foreign banks with accounts  and restricting or prohibiting certain correspondent accounts 
while management believes that the patriot act may affect recordkeeping and reporting expenses to some degree  it does not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
effects of governmental monetary policies profitability in banking depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest earned on a bank s loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on a bank s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities is the major source of a bank s earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy for such purposes as controlling inflation and recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing from the frb and the establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the company are not predictable 
item a 
risk factors historical performance may not be indicative of future performance and  as noted elsewhere in this report  the company has included forward looking statements about it s business  plans and prospects that are subject to change 
forward looking statements are particularly located in  but not limited to  the sections item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report  the following risks may affect operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if any of these risks occur  either alone or 
table of contents in combination with other factors  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  readers should note this is not an exhaustive list  that some risks are unknown or not quantifiable  and other risks that are currently perceived as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected 
statements about plans  predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action 
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company has established a reserve for possible losses expected in connection with loans in the credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects estimates of the collectibility of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding 
the determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is subjective  although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  the company cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if the loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  it may require unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan loss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that the allowance was inadequate  they may require the company to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact revenues and financial condition 
growth and management 
financial performance and profitability will depend on the company s ability to manage recent growth and potential future growth 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to execute it s growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that it has achieved in the past 
changes in market interest rates 
the company s earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as the net interest spread 
based on the company s current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  net interest spread could be expected to increase during times when interest rates rise in a parallel shift along the yield curve and  conversely  to decline during times of similar falling interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although management believes the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity 
liquidity measures the ability to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service liabilities as they come due 
dramatic fluctuations in loan or deposit balances make it challenging to manage liquidity 
a sharp reduction in deposits could force the company to borrow heavily in the wholesale deposit market 
in addition  rapid loan growth during periods of low liquidity could induce the company to purchase federal funds from correspondent banks  borrow at the federal home loan bank of seattle or federal reserve discount window  raise deposit interest rates and or decline loans 
geographic concentration 
substantially  all of the company s business is derived from a five county area in northwest washington state 
employment opportunities within these communities have traditionally been primarily in the areas of military spending  oil and gas industries  tourism and manufacturing 
many of the markets served by the company have quickly earned a reputation as desirable places for quality of life for families and entrepreneurs 
while the company s expansion strategy has been built around these growing and diverse geographic markets  the company s business is  and will remain  sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and to local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in the company s markets  may have a more pronounced effect upon it s business than they might on an institution that is more broadly diverse in geographic concentration 
the extent of 
table of contents the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon the company s results of operation and financial condition 
regulation 
the company is subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict it s activities  which in turn could adversely impact operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  as well as shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
moreover  federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent  significant changes 
changes in laws and regulations may affect the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities including insurance and securities activities  or the company s competitive position in relation to credit unions  savings associations and other financial institutions 
these changes could also reduce federal deposit insurance coverage  broaden the powers or geographic range of financial holding companies  alter the taxation of financial institutions and change the structure and jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies 
federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  can significantly affect credit availability 
other federal legislation such as the sarbanes oxley act can dramatically shift resources and costs to ensure adequate compliance 
competition 
the financial services business in the company s market areas is highly competitive and competition may adversely affect performance 
competition continues to increase due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
the company faces competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans and competes for loans principally through the pricing of interest rates and loan fees  and the efficiency and quality of services 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce our market share or cause the pricing for services to be realigned 
results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
credit risk 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  which it believes are appropriate to minimize risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying its credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect results of operations

on october   the company distributed a stock dividend  and on february   the company distributed a stock dividend 
in addition  the company declared a for stock split to shareholders of record as of may   which was distributed on may  the ability of the company to pay dividends will depend on the profitability of the bank  the need to retain or increase capital  and the dividend restrictions imposed upon the bank by applicable banking law 
although the company anticipates payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend  future dividends are subject to these limitations and to the discretion of the board of directors  and could be reduced or eliminated
