item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
the company s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets  primarily loans and investments  and the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the company s products and services 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding interest rate risk  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
economic conditions  limited geographic diversification 
the company conducts business from offices that are exclusively located in nine contiguous counties of southern indiana  from which substantially all of its customer base is drawn 
because of the geographic concentration of its operations and customer base  the company s results depend largely upon economic conditions in this area 
deterioration in economic conditions in this area could adversely affect the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services  and accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

competition 
the banking and financial services business in the company s markets is highly competitive 
the company competes in its geographic markets with regional  national and international competitors that are much larger in total assets and capitalization than the company 
in addition  new banks could be organized in the company s market area which might bid aggressively for new business to capture market share in these markets 
developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

risks of future changes in our businesses and capital structure 
the company from time to time considers opportunities to expand the company s businesses by launching new internal business initiatives and by buying or investing in other businesses 
the company s earnings and financial condition could be adversely affected to the extent that the acquisitions or other business initiatives and strategies are not successful or take longer than expected to achieve expected results and such initiative or strategies could even result in losses to the company 
the company also from time to time engages in activities such as repurchasing and issuing its capital stock or other securities  and utilizing the borrowing capacity of its parent company to borrow funds from third party lenders on short and long term bases in order to manage its capital structure in a manner that it believes is most advantageous 
these capital management activities  however  also carry risks in the event that the company s business does not develop as expected or there are changes in the market for the company s common stock or in the capital and financial markets generally 
government regulation  legislative changes  and monetary policy 
the company and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations 
the restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the company conducts its business  undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing 
these regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit the company s shareholders 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the control of the company 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws including changes in federal or state laws affecting corporate taxpayers generally or financial institutions specifically could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions for the company  and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

risk of changes in accounting policies or requirements or accounting estimates or judgments 
the financial condition and results of operations of the company that are presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change  and the effect of any change in estimates or judgments that might be caused by future developments or resolution of uncertainties could be materially adverse to the company s reported financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of securities available for sale  and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial  agricultural and poultry loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or special mention  or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard or special mention and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized and included with other assets for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and age 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company periodically validates its valuation model by obtaining an independent valuation of its msrs 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates  and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and age 
if temporary impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
the company annually reviews msrs for other than temporary impairment and recognizes a direct write down when the recoverability of a recorded valuation allowance is determined to be remote 
in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred  the company considers both historical and projected trends in interest rates  prepayment activity within the strata  and the potential for impairment recovery through interest rate increases 
unlike a valuation allowance  a direct write down permanently reduces the carrying value of the msrs and the valuation allowance  precluding subsequent recoveries 
as of december   the company analyzed the sensitivity of its msrs to changes in prepayment rates 
in estimating the changes in prepayment rates  market interest rates were assumed to be increased and decreased by 
at december  the company s msrs had a fair value of  using a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a increase in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs would be  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a decline in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs would be  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
securities valuation securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value 
additionally  all securities are required to be written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  therefore  future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  management considers the reason for the decline  the extent of the decline and the duration of the decline 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding unrealized losses on the securities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million non cash pre tax charge for the other than temporary decline in value on its fhlmc and fnma floating rate preferred stock portfolio 
the company accounts for these securities in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that if the decline in fair market value below cost is determined to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss must be recognized as expense in the income statement 
during the quarter ended december   public disclosures regarding accounting practices at fnma and a multi billion dollar fnma preferred stock issuance with a substantially different structure and higher yield than previous offerings had a detrimental effect on the fair value of both the fhlmc and fnma preferred stock holdings 
in connection with the preparation of the company s financial statements included elsewhere in this report  management in january concluded  as a result of the factors identified in the preceding sentence and the magnitude and length of time the market value had been below cost  that management could not forecast full recovery of the fair values of these securities in a reasonable time period 
accordingly  management determined to recognize the other than temporary impairment in the income statement for the fourth quarter of as an investment securities loss 
there was no additional other than temporary impairment determined for year end on this segment or any segments of the company s securities portfolio 
income tax expense income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods  including consideration of available tax planning strategies 
as of december   the company has a deferred tax asset of million representing various tax credit carryforwards 
based on the long carryforward periods available  management has assessed it more likely than not that these credits will be realized and no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
at december   the company also has a deferred tax asset representing unrealized capital losses on equity securities 
should these capital losses be realized  management believes the company has the ability to generate sufficient capital gains to realize the tax benefit of the capital losses during the available carryforward period  including the use of tax planning strategies related to mortgage servicing rights  appreciated securities and appreciated fhlb stock 
as a result  no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
loss contingencies  including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in considering the likelihood of loss  management considers the nature of the contingency  the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal  the opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  experience of the company or other enterprises in similar matters  if any  and management s intended response to any assessment 
during the first quarter of  the company received notices of proposed assessments of unpaid financial institutions tax for the years and of approximately   net of federal tax  including interest and penalties of approximately  the company filed a protest with the indiana department of revenue contesting the proposed assessments and intends to vigorously defend its position that the income of the nevada subsidiaries is not subject to the indiana financial institutions tax 
although there can be no such assurance  at this time management does not believe that it is probable that this potential assessment will result in additional tax liability 
therefore  no tax provision has been recognized for the potential assessment of additional financial institutions tax for and or for financial institutions tax with respect to any of the nevada subsidiaries in any period subsequent to  including the year ended december  results of operations net income net income increased  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the earnings increase was largely attributable to a  after tax  or per share  other than temporary impairment charge on the company s portfolio of fhlmc and fnma preferred stocks 
excluding the effect of this other than temporary impairment charge  net income for would have been  or per share 
in addition to the effect of the securities impairment charge  the earnings comparison of to was positively impacted by improvements in net interest income of  as well as increases in the level of other non interest income 
non interest income  excluding the impairment charge on equity securities in  increased by approximately  in compared to these increases were partially mitigated by increased non interest expense of  a significant portion of which relates to increased employee health insurance costs  and increased income tax expense of   excluding the tax effect of the impairment charge in 
net income declined  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the earnings decline was directly attributable to a  after tax  or per share  other than temporary impairment charge on the company s portfolio of fhlmc and fnma preferred stocks 
excluding the effect of this other than temporary impairment charge  net income for would have been  or per share 
in comparing reported earnings for to  the impairment charge was mitigated to some degree by increased net interest income  increased trust and investment product fees and insurance fees  and no net loss on the extinguishment of borrowings during also contributing to the lower level of earnings in compared with was a decline in mortgage loan originations and subsequent sales of mortgage loans and an increased provision for loan losses 
net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income increased  or  or on a tax equivalent basis in compared with net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for  the net interest margin increased to compared with in the company s increase in net interest income during compared with was largely attributable to the increase in the net interest margin 
the company s yield on earning assets increased to during compared with for the increased yield on earning assets was primarily attributable to higher short term interest rates and an increased level of loans outstanding during compared with the company s cost of funds expressed as a percentage of average earning assets during was compared with for the increase in the cost of funds was due to a rise in short term market interest rates tempered by an increased level of non maturity deposits including non interest bearing demand accounts  less reliance on time deposits and borrowings and a decline in interest rates on outstanding borrowings from the federal home loan bank due to repayments of higher cost advances that were outstanding in net interest income increased during by  or  or on a tax equivalent basis compared to for  the net interest margin increased to compared with in the company s increase in net interest income in compared with was largely attributable to the increased net interest margin that was largely driven by a decline in the company s cost of funds 
the company s cost of funds was reduced due to a number of factors including the historically low level of interest rates during and and the change in the mix of the deposit base to a higher dependence on non maturity deposits and less dependence on time deposits 
also contributing to the lower cost of funds during was the repayment of higher costing fhlb advances during in the company s mortgage banking segment

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision is affected by net charge offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations required on the allowance 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
loan loss provision remained relatively stable during compared with while net charge offs increased in  a portion of the increase in charge offs was provided for prior to as discussed in additional detail in the non performing assets section of this report  non performing loans increased in due primarily to three large commercial and industrial credits for which loss allocations have been provided 
two of these loans were internally classified prior to the provision for loan losses increased by  during compared with the significant increase in provision for loan losses during compared with was largely attributable to the continued change in the composition of the company s loan portfolio toward a greater concentration in commercial and agricultural loans and less concentration in residential mortgage loans 
also contributing to the increased provision for loan losses was an increase in specific allocations on internally classified loans and an overall higher level of net charge offs during compared with these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated  probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which are used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors

provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  in   and the higher effective tax rate in compared with both and was the result of higher levels of before tax net income combined with a lower level tax exempt investment income and a lower level of tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
the effective tax rate in all periods is lower than the blended statutory rate of 
the lower effective rate in all periods primarily resulted from the company s tax exempt investment income on securities and loans  income tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects  and income generated by subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional details relative to the company s income tax provision 
since december   the company s effective tax rate has been favorably impacted by indiana financial institution tax savings resulting from the company s formation of investment subsidiaries in the state of nevada by four of the company s banking subsidiaries 
the state of nevada has no state or local income tax 
during the first quarter of  the company received notices of proposed assessments of unpaid indiana financial institutions tax for the years and of approximately   net of federal tax  including interest and penalties of approximately  the company filed a protest with the indiana department of revenue contesting the proposed assessments and intends to vigorously defend its position that the income of the nevada subsidiaries is not subject to the indiana financial institutions tax 
although there can be no such assurance  at this time management does not believe that it is probable that this potential assessment will result in additional tax liability 
therefore  no tax provision has been recognized for the potential assessment of additional financial institutions tax for and or for financial institutions tax with respect to any of the nevada subsidiaries in any period subsequent to  including capital resources the company and affiliate banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications  including well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
the company and all affiliate banks at year end were categorized as well capitalized as that term is defined by applicable regulations 
the company has agreed with its parent company correspondent bank lender  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as a term of its credit facilities with that lender see sources of funds parent company funding sources  below that it will maintain the capital ratios of the company and its affiliate banks at levels that would qualify it as well capitalized as that term is defined by the prompt corrective action regulations

the mortgage related securities provide structured cash flows in what has continued to be a relatively low longer term interest rate environment 
the company s level of obligations of state and political subdivisions declined million or during and million or in the decline in obligations of state and political subdivisions has been primarily the result of the company s strategy to not invest in these traditionally longer term securities during periods of relatively low longer term interest rates

however  in the relatively low longer term interest rate environment  investments in these types of securities have not been undertaken

average demand  savings and money market deposits totaled million or of core deposits in compared with million or in and million or in these increases have contributed to the company s increased net interest margin as was discussed in the results of operations net interest income section of this report

parent company funding sources the company is a corporation separate and distinct from its bank and other subsidiaries 
for information regarding the financial condition  result of operations  and cash flows of the company  presented on a parent company only basis  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company uses funds at the parent company level to pay dividends to its shareholders  to acquire or make other investments in other businesses or their securities or assets  to repurchase its stock from time to time  and for other general corporate purposes 
the parent company does not have access at the parent company level to the deposits and certain other sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiaries to support their operations 
instead  the parent company has historically derived most of its revenues from dividends paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to statutory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
the parent company has in recent years supplemented the dividends received from its subsidiaries with borrowings  which are discussed in detail below 
on september  but effective as of september   the company and jpmorgan chase bank  na the lender executed and delivered to each other an amended and restated loan agreement amended agreement  and the company executed and delivered to the lender a million term note and a million revolving note pursuant to the amended agreement to evidence its obligations for amounts that may from time to time be borrowed thereunder

risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate risk management committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable  incurred credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

as discussed in additional detail in the non performing assets section of this report  the increased level of non performing assets was primarily attributable to three larger commercial and industrial credits 
increased net charge offs during compared with limited the amount of increase in the level of allowance for loan losses at year end compared with year end a portion of these increased net charge offs during was provided for in the significant increase in provision for loan losses in compared with prior periods 
the provision for loan loss remained relatively stable during  declining approximately  compared with following an increase of million in compared with net charge offs increased to  or of average outstanding loans during this level compares to net charge offs of  or of average outstanding loans in and  or of average outstanding loans in the increase in the level of loan charge offs in was attributable primarily to commercial and industrial loans  but was not necessarily attributable to a particular segment within the commercial and industrial portfolio 
the increase in was attributable to a modestly higher level of loan charge offs coupled with a significant reduction in the level of recoveries of previously charged off loans 
the trend in the decline in residential mortgage loan allocations  indicated in the table above  has resulted from the trend of declining net charge offs and the lower concentration of this type of loans 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance has fluctuated from period to period

non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection

the net effect of this activity has been to increase the level of non performing loans for the company at year end as compared with year end the increased level at year end as compared with was the result of one commercial real estate credit that was resolved on terms consistent with management s expectations during the first quarter of the company is closely monitoring developments in the status of the three larger credit facilities that were placed on non accrual status during the first of these credits is a million loan to a manufacturing entity which has ceased operations 
during the latter part of the third quarter of  the real estate and equipment of the manufacturing entity were sold at auction 
the sale is expected to be completed during the second quarter of the indebtedness owed the company on this credit is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the borrower s assets  including those sold at auction 
the second of these specific credits  which totals approximately million  is extended to a borrower operating two hotel facilities 
this credit is secured by a first priority lien on the hotel facilities 
the borrower is currently operating the hotels and is actively attempting to negotiate the sale of the facilities 
the third of these specific credits  which is extended to a borrower operating a retail grocery store chain  is a interest the company s current balance is approximately million in a credit facility that is led by harris  na  chicago  illinois 
the borrower  which filed for chapter bankruptcy relief on may   has submitted a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court and it is anticipated  based on current available information  the plan will be subject to court approval after consideration of any objections to the plan confirmed by the end of the second quarter of under the plan as filed with the court  the company would be paid approximately of the amount owed to it  which is consistent with the projected payment that the company has assumed for purposes of establishing a special allocation of possible loss for this credit as part of the company s determination of its allowance for loan losses 
the company will continue to assess the internal classification of these credits and the level of specific allocation of the loan loss reserve attributable to these credits based upon the best information that is available from time to time  including the status of the sale of the manufacturing facility and of the hotel facilities  and developments in the grocery store chain bankruptcy case 
the increased level of non performing loans at year end as compared with was the result of one commercial real estate credit

loan impairment is reported when full repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
commercial  agricultural and poultry loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include real estate loans secured by one to four family residences and loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures 
individually evaluated loans on non accrual are generally considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible

liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary banks to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon term financing arrangement and a line of credit established by the parent company in september with a correspondent bank lender as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than stand by letters of credit as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity
