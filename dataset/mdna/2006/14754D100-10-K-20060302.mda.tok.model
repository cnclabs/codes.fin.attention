critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
loan transactions may conclude based upon redemption  renewal  or forfeiture of the loan collateral 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
in the event the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company is able to quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was over estimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease by million in and net income would decrease by million 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or market 
management provides an allowance for shrinkage and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise 
because pawn loans are made without the borrower s personal liability  the company does not investigate the creditworthiness of the borrower  but evaluates the pledged personal property as a basis for its lending decision 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the sources 
table of contents for the company s determination of the estimated disposition value are numerous and include the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogues  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance  which was million  representing of the balance of merchandise held for disposition at december  adverse changes in the disposition value of the company s merchandise may result in the need to increase the valuation allowance 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on company owned cash advances including fees and interest and accrues losses for third party lender owned cash advances at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance product primarily services a customer base of non prime borrowers 
these advances are typically offered as single payment cash advances over a typical term of to days  however  in certain locations  the company also arranges for its customers to obtain installment cash advances originated by commercial banks  which are typically payable over a term of months 
cash advances written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding portfolio by age  delinquency and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
current portfolio performance as well as the performance of cash advances made in the same period twelve months ago and collection history are utilized to develop expected loss rates which are used for the establishment of the allowance 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
unlike pawn loans  cash advances are unsecured  and the performance of the portfolio depends on the company s ability to collect on defaulted loans 
the company believes it effectively manages the risks inherent in this product by utilizing a variety of underwriting criteria  maintaining a customer database of performance and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
any remaining unpaid balance of a cash advance is charged off once it has been in default for days or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
at december   allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned cash advances were  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision  which increases the allowance for loan losses  for the combined cash advance portfolio was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party lenders 
assuming future loss rates increased  or decreased  by for  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income would decrease  or increase  by million  assuming the same volume of cash advances written in valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the 
table of contents tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december   due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets resulting from capital losses 
the valuation allowance is based on company estimates of capital gains expected to be recognized during the period over which the capital losses may be used to offset such gains 
in the event that the company determined that it would not be able to realize all or part of its other net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle 
it also requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
the statement will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based method in accounting for share based transactions with employees 
sfas r also amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
sfas r is effective for annual periods that begin after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations because of the company s decision in to begin granting restricted stock units in lieu of stock options 
the value of restricted stock unit grants is generally recognized as expense over the vesting period

in march  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued revised guidelines affecting certain short term cash advance products offered by fdic regulated banks 
the revised guidance applies to the cash advance product that was offered by third party banks in many of the company s locations

credit services that the company provides to its customers include arranging loans with independent third party lenders  assisting in the preparation of loan applications and loan documents  and accepting loan payments at the location where the loans were arranged 
if a company customer obtains a loan from a third party lender through the cso program  the company  on behalf of its customer  also guarantees the customer s payment obligations under the loan to the third party lender

as of december   the outstanding principal balance of these bank originated multi payment installment cash advances was million in california and  in georgia 
the company expects to discontinue offering bank products in california and georgia during the first or second quarter of due principally to its third party commercial banks anticipated response to concerns that the fdic raised to fdic supervised banks in late february concerning the fdic s perception of risks associated with fdic supervised banks origination of certain cash advance products with the assistance of third party marketers and servicers 
in california  upon any discontinuation of the company s offering of bank cash advance products  the company will still serve cash advance consumers by continuing to offer company originated cash advance products re introduced in august pursuant to state law

during the fourth quarter of  these markets represented million in total revenue  of which only  was attributable to cash advance revenue before loss provision generated from million of cash advances originated by third party banks 
management estimates that the revenue levels in georgia and north carolina markets will be lower going forward due to the discontinuance of the company arranging for third party commercial bank originated cash advance products within the pawn lending locations in these markets but does not anticipate a change in pawn related revenue activities in these markets 
pawn related revenue in these markets could increase as customers seek alternative sources of needed credit due to the elimination of cash advance activities 
management anticipates continued growth in cash advance fees for fiscal due to increased consumer awareness and demand for the cash advance product  higher outstanding balances at december  compared to december   and the growth of balances from new units opened in   and planned openings in in addition  the company will receive the benefit of higher realized yields due to the probable elimination of cash advance products offered by third party commercial banks and any corresponding reduction in the amount of cash advance fee revenue that might otherwise have been attributable to the third party commercial banks

the company maintains an allowance for losses on cash advances at a level projected to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance loss provision is utilized to increase the allowance carried against the outstanding company owned cash advance portfolio as well as expected losses in the third party lender owned portfolios

management believes that losses related to those customers contributed to the lower recoveries and higher loss rates 
the company also adjusted the terms of its underwriting related to these loans at the end of to broaden the number of customers who would qualify for a cash advance 
management believes this change led to higher loss rates in the loss provision as a percentage of cash advances written increased to in from in while actual net charge offs charge offs less recoveries were in compared to in the loss provision as a percentage of cash advance fees increased to in from in due primarily to the addition of resources to its collection activities in the latter part of and ongoing adjustments to underwriting standards  management anticipates that loss rates will plateau  and possibly decline slightly during depreciation and amortization

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate cap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
in  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million of the company s outstanding floating rate line of credit for a term of months at a fixed libor rate of 
this interest rate cap agreement is perfectly effective at december  the company had net variable rate borrowings outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rates on million and million of the net variable rate borrowings at december  and  respectively  were capped at and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to increase basis points over the rates at december  and  respectively  and the variable rate borrowings outstanding remained constant  the company s interest expense would increase by  and  and net income after taxes would decrease by  and  in and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to decrease basis points from the rates at december  and  respectively  the combined fair values of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt million and million  respectively would increase by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
gold price risk 
the company periodically uses forward sale contracts with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of refined gold produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of forfeited gold merchandise 
a significant decrease in the price of gold would result in a reduction of proceeds from the disposition of refined gold to the extent that amounts sold were in excess of the amount of contracted forward sales 
in addition  a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold 
table of contents would negatively impact the value of some of the goods pledged as collateral by customers and identified for liquidation as refined gold 
in this instance  management believes some customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount 
however  those customers unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral would receive lower loan amounts  possibly resulting in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company 
foreign exchange risk 
the notes receivable received in the sale of the company s foreign operations are subject to the risk of unexpected change in swedish kronor exchange rates 
as a result of fluctuations in swedish kronor  the company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of  net of a gain of  on the foreign currency forward contracts and gains of million in and  respectively 
as a result of the establishment of the million swedish kronor currency forward contracts in mid year to minimize the market fluctuations  substantially all of the impact of a potential decline in the exchange rate of the swedish kronor would be offset by the gains realized on those forward contracts 
a hypothetical decline in the exchange rate of the swedish kronor at december  would have decreased net income by
