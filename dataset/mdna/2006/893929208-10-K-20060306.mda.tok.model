overview transcend provides medical transcription services to the healthcare industry 
powered by our web based voice and data distribution technology  our home based medical language specialists document patient care by converting physicians voice recordings into electronic medical record documents 
on january  we completed the acquisition of medical dictation  inc mdi 
on april   we fulfilled the prerequisites for receiving the proceeds under a promissory note dated march  payable to the development corporation of abilene  inc dcoa in the principal amount of  on december   we entered into a four year million credit facility with healthcare finance group 
these transactions have had a material effect on the company s financial statements for the year ended december  and are expected to have a material effect on future periods 
critical accounting estimates which are material to registrant a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we reported goodwill and intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the goodwill and intangible assets are associated with two acquisitions during the company had no goodwill or intangibles as of december  we will review goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we will calculate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the approach utilized will be dependent on a number of factors including estimate of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we will base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates
