discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates if different assumptions were used or different events ultimately transpire 
we believe that the following are the most critical accounting policies that requires management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments  often due to a need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain valuation of accounts receivable the ultimate amount of collections received against outstanding accounts receivable must take into account returns  allowances and deductions that may be made by our customers 
many retailers to whom we sell products take deductions for various forms of marketing expenses  as well as participating in nationwide reclamation cooperatives for processing damaged goods 
other expenses to which we are subject to  in addition to those experienced in the retail environment but also with professional products sold to distributors include deductions for freight if the invoice is paid within specified terms  co op advertising allowances  new store warehouse allowances and  from time to time  limited rebate programs 
we attempt to estimate these costs  as well as providing for anticipated bad debts  by recording allowances based upon our experience  economic conditions  normal customer inventory levels and or competitive conditions 
actual returns  credits or allowances  as well as the condition of any product actually returned  may differ significantly from the estimates used by the company 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically evaluate inventory levels  giving consideration to factors such as the physical condition of the goods  the sales patterns of finished goods and the useful life of particular packaging  componentry and finished goods and estimate a reasonable write down amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the inventory write downs were established 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may be impaired 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
if the results of this testing indicates an impairment of the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration circumstances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 
the use of various acceptable and appropriate methods of valuation requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not own or maintain an interest in derivative or other financial instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
in addition  the company does not invest in securities that would require disclosure of market risk  nor does it have floating rate loans or foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company has no interest rate risk on its fixed rate debt since the interest rate on the note payable to a bank resets annually upon the anniversary of the loan august at basis points above the interest rate earned on the restricted cash that collateralizes the loan
