item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  specialty minerals company and earn our revenues and profits from a diverse group of industrial and consumer product lines 
our minerals segment operates manufacturing facilities in north america  europe  and asia pacific regions and has three principal market applications metalcasting  pet products and specialty minerals 
our environmental segment also operates manufacturing facilities in those same regions 
the environmental segment s principal markets are lining technologies  building materials and water treatment 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that performs trucking services for our domestic minerals and environmental businesses as well as third parties 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the united states and china 
additionally  through our affiliates and joint ventures  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india and mexico 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which requires us to identify which markets our reserves can serve 
we believe that our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are the core components of our longevity and future prospects 
our customers are engaged in varied end markets and geographies 
customers in the minerals segment range from foundries that produce castings for automotive  industrial  and transportation equipment  including heavy duty trucks and railroad cars  to producers of consumer goods  including cat box filler  cosmetics and detergents 
the customers for our lining technologies and building materials products are predominantly engineering contractors 
the oilfield services customer base is primarily comprised of oil service or exploration companies 
a significant portion of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our business is performed under short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
approximately of our revenue is generated in north america  consequently  the state of the us economy impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in the asia pacific and central european regions  which have continued to outpace the united states in economic growth 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we employ number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal o organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have a history of commitment to research and development and using this resource to bring innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 
o globalization we have expanded our manufacturing and marketing organizations into europe and asia pacific over the last years 
this operating experience enables us to expand further into emerging markets 
we see the significant opportunities in the asia pacific region for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow 
we expect to take advantage of these growth areas either through our wholly owned subsidiaries or investments in affiliates and joint ventures 
o mineral development bentonite is a component in a majority of the products we produce 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 
o acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to add complementary businesses to our portfolio of products 
over the last four years  we have acquired a number of businesses for a total cost of approximately million 
a strong financial position will enable us to continue to acquire businesses which  in our assessment  are valued fairly and fit with our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
risk factors and item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in general  the significance of these risks has not changed over the past year 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our management has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
these policies are discussed below and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe these critical accounting policies have resulted in past actual results approximating the estimated amounts in each respective area 
these accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  management prepares lists of inventory quantities on hand and determines the amount of such inventories that  based on projected demand  are not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  are excess or obsolete 
this list is then reviewed with sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets we have made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and have a moderate investment in goodwill 
for property  plant and equipment  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  we perform an annual impairment assessment at year end at the reporting unit level or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in analyzing the fair value of goodwill and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  management uses models which are based on estimates of future operating performance and related cash flows 
in preparing these models  management must make estimates in projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  in selecting a discount rate that reflects the related business risks  and in determining the appropriate perpetuity or disposal value 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
our estimates related to the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our united states employees hired on or before december  in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  we must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with our actuaries 
to determine our net accrued benefit and net periodic benefit cost  we form judgments about the best estimate for each assumption used in the actuarial computation 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield of a standardized benchmark  the moody s aa corporate bond index  which consists of high quality fixed income investments  and round it to the nearest basis points 
the discount rate used to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at september   was 
in  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation by million and increased the net cost by  or thousand 
likewise in  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by million and decreased the net cost by  or thousand 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the historical long term performance  as adjusted for existing market conditions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
we assumed a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of to determine our net benefit cost in a basis point decrease in the expected return would have increased the net cost by approximately  or thousand  in likewise  a basis point increase in the expected return would have decreased the net cost by thousand 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe our positions may be overturned 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
the rate is then applied to pre tax income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our estimates of income tax items  expense and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
valuation allowances are recorded  if necessary  to measure a deferred tax asset at an estimated realizable value 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
changes in a valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we determine events have occurred that will impact the realizable value of the asset 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve or valuation allowance  is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our united states federal income tax returns have been completed through state income tax returns are audited more infrequently 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recording of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution 
new accounting standards in  the company adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies both the definition of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as that term is used in fasb statement no 
and when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company s adoption of fin in march did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas also requires that a change in method of depreciating  amortizing or depleting a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   as such  the company s adoption of this standard in fiscal is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb amended fas sfas r  and the guidance contained therein was to become effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed mandatory compliance with this standard starting with the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year that begins after december  since the company s next fiscal year will begin january   the company intends to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of  and such adoption is not anticipated to have a material effect on the company s financial statements as the majority of our options issued prior to january   the date we adopted sfas no 
 have already vested 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june   adoption of this eitf in the third quarter of did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion below references the consolidated statement of operations included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared with million for and million for  which were increases of and in and  respectively 
minerals contributed approximately of the increase in net sales over the environmental and transportation segments contributed and  respectively  to the increase in net sales  intersegment shipping revenue increased by over approximately of the growth in net sales for was attributed to acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation combined 
in comparing with  minerals accounted for approximately of the increase  while environmental and transportation contributed and  respectively 
acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the over increase 
gross profit was million for the year ended december   compared with million for and million in the increase in gross profit in over was generated by the growth in net sales 
on a segment basis  minerals contributed approximately of the increase over  while environmental and transportation accounted for and  respectively 
relative to the comparison of with  the increase in gross profit followed sales growth 
minerals contributed approximately of the growth in gross profit  while environmental and transportation accounted for and  respectively 
gross margin was in  in and in we did not realize an improvement in gross margin in over due to higher raw material  transportation and energy related costs 
these higher costs depressed gross margins in both the minerals and environmental segments in the basis point decline in from was also primarily influenced by higher production and transportation costs 
additionally  the environmental segment gross margins declined in  due to a greater proportion of lower margin product sales in that year 
general  selling and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million in and million in the increase in over was primarily attributable to greater employee benefit and compensation costs  sarbanes oxley compliance related costs  and audit fees 
the increase in over was attributed to a number of expenses including higher compensation  employee benefits and professional and consulting fees associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
included in the professional fees was million for assistance in filing amended us income tax returns 
operating profit was million for the year ended december   compared with million in and million in the improvement in operating profit and resulted from the increase in sales and gross profit 
operating margin for was  compared with in and in on a segment basis  minerals  environmental and transportation operating margins improved in over due to the relatively modest increases in general  selling and administrative expenses as compared with the increase in gross profit 
in comparing with  the minerals segment s operating margin increased  however  a decline in the environmental segment s margin offset the improvement 
a review of sales  gross profit  general  selling and administrative expenses and operating profit by segment follows 
minerals segment year ended december  minerals vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands net sales      cost of sales    gross profit      general  selling and administrative expenses     operating profit      vs 
base businesses those businesses owned for greater than one year accounted for all of the growth over the prior year 
metalcasting and pet products revenues accounted for a large majority of the increase 
domestic metalcasting revenue growth was primarily attributed to selling price increases that were implemented to offset increases in raw materials  transportation and energy related costs 
metalcasting revenue also improved due to higher sales volumes in china and thailand 
higher volumes and selling price increases led to the improvement in pet products revenues 
specialty minerals revenues were relatively flat in comparison with the prior year 
detergent additives volumes declined in but were offset by increases in volumes and selling prices in the oil and gas drilling fluids product lines 
gross profit improved with the increase in net sales  however  gross margin declined by basis points 
additionally  gross profit in benefited from a million one time reduction in mining related taxes owed to the state of montana 
excluding this benefit  gross profit would have improved over by approximately and gross margin would have been 
selling price increases were not large enough to offset the actual increase in raw materials  transportation and energy related costs 
general  selling and administrative expenses declined slightly in partly because included a charge for million related to increased bad debt reserves 
also  included a benefit of million related to a million greater benefit from gains on the disposals of certain assets 
operating margin improved by basis points due to flat general  selling and administrative expenses 
vs 
the increase in sales resulted from strong volume growth in the metalcasting and specialty minerals businesses 
metalcasting sales were also aided by price increases implemented as result of rising raw material and transportation costs 
the detergent additives business led the increase in specialty minerals sales 
pet products sales were relatively stable 
acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the increase in sales 
gross profit increased commensurate with higher sales 
gross margin improved by basis points due to higher volumes which contributed to lower production costs for certain businesses 
general  selling and administrative expenses increased due to higher compensation and benefit costs 
acquisitions and foreign exchange also contributed to the increase 
operating profit improved due to the greater sales and gross profit as explained above 
operating margin improved by basis points as a result of greater volume in the metalcasting and specialty minerals businesses 
environmental segment year ended december  environmental vs

dollars in thousands net sales      cost of sales    gross profit      general  selling and administrative expenses      operating profit      vs 
base businesses accounted for approximately of the growth in net sales  while favorable foreign currency translation and acquisitions represented the remainder 
lining technologies and water treatment product line revenues accounted for a large majority of the increase 
higher volumes in all three regions  americas  europe middle east and asia pacific  led to the increase in lining technologies revenues 
we also benefited from higher average selling prices in the united states water treatment revenues improved principally due to higher volumes and service activity in the oilfield services business 
gross profit increased in conjunction with sales 
gross margin decreased by basis points due to a greater proportion of revenues generated from lower profit product lines 
certain lining technologies and oilfield service product service lines have lower gross margins 
general  selling and administrative expenses grew at more modest rates as employee headcount levels remained fairly stable compared with operating profit improved inconjunction with the increase in gross profit 
operating margin improved by basis points which largely resulted from the increase in general  selling and administrative expenses 
vs 
the million increase in sales was primarily attributed to the impact of acquisitions 
the two acquisitions  which were completed as of january   contributed approximately of the growth in sales 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details on the acquisitions 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation accounted for approximately of the increase 
strong volume increases in the european lining technologies and building materials businesses also contributed to the increase 
gross profit increased due to the increase in sales  however  gross margins declined by basis points 
lower relative profitability on sales generated by the acquired businesses was the primary reason for the gross margin decline 
the domestic businesses also experienced gross margin pressure due to increased raw materials and logistics costs 
general  selling and administrative expenses increased due to higher compensation and benefit costs 
acquisitions and foreign exchange also accounted for the increase 
operating profit improved with the increase in sales and gross profit  however  operating margin declined by basis points 
as referenced in the explanation for the gross margin decline  acquisitions had the primary detrimental impact on operating margin 
transportation segment year ended december  transportation vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands net sales      cost of sales    gross profit     general  selling and administrative expenses    operating profit    vs 
revenues grew due to higher business levels  equipment utilization rates  and average rates charged to customers 
approximately of the segment s revenues were generated from services provided to certain domestic subsidiaries within our minerals and environmental segments 
gross profit improved commensurate with the increase in revenues 
gross margin benefited from improved equipment utilization and higher revenue rates 
diesel fuel surcharges negatively impacted gross margin  however  the segment was able to offset a majority of the cost by passing through those charges to customers 
vs 
a majority of the increase in sales was attributed to greater intersegment business 
both the domestic minerals and environmental segments experienced higher volumes that led to the increase in transportation services 
intersegment sales accounted for approximately of the segment total 
higher freight rates also contributed to the increase 
corporate segment year ended december  corporate vs 
vs 
dollars in thousands intersegment shipping sales    intersegment shipping costs    gross profit corporate general  selling and administrative expenses      nanocomposite business development expenses    operating loss      vs 
intersegment shipping sales and costs are related to billings from the transportation segment to the domestic minerals and environmental segments for services 
these services are invoiced to the minerals and environmental segments at arms length rates and those costs are subsequently charged to customers 
intersegment sales and costs reported above reflect the elimination of these transactions 
corporate costs include management information systems  human resources  investor relations  corporate communications and finance 
additionally  marketing  research and development and operating costs related to the development of the nanocomposite business are included in this segment 
as described in the comparison of with expenses  included million of professional service fees  which are considered non recurring in nature 
excluding these fees from our results in  segment expenses in would have increased by approximately million  or 
contributing to the increase were greater expensese associated with stock based compensation  corporate development activities  professional service fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  independent registered accountant services and tax services 
nanocomposite business development expenses were comparable to the prior year 
no material changes occurred in related to new customers or product introductions 
vs 
we recorded approximately million of tax consulting fees in in connection with the filing of amended federal income tax returns to claim refunds for increased deductions and credits for the through periods 
further background on the amended returns is described below in the income taxes narrative 
other operating expenses that impacted the segment were increased stock compensation costs and higher professional and consulting fees associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act compliance 
nanocomposite expenses declined slightly due lower net spending on business development expenses 
net interest expense net interest expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
average debt levels were million and million in and  respectively 
debt increased in principally due to higher average working capital and greater capital expenditures 
in  debt increased due to acquisitions and higher average working capital 
average interest rates on our funded debt were  and in  and  respectively 
a majority of the interest on our debt is based upon libor rates 
other income expense  net net other expense in was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in  we recognized net other income of million 
other income is composed of a number of miscellaneous transactions  primarily foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for was  compared with in and in a schedule is included in note  income taxes  as part of the notes to consolidated financial statements which reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate 
the largest benefit to the tax rate in was higher depletions deductions  lower average foreign tax rates and reductions in estimates of taxes payable which were determined in conjunction with preparation of the income tax returns in in  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of million associated with depletion deductions and research and development credits available in computing income tax expense 
approximately million of this amount relates to changes in estimates resulting from the finalization  in  of the tax return for the tax year 
the remaining million relates to the filing of amended federal income tax returns dating from through regarding the amended income tax returns  after consultation with tax advisors  we recomputed our federal income tax liability for these periods after determining that we could increase certain deductions and credits as allowed under the internal revenue code 
the total refund claimed on the returns was million  however  we determined that a contingency reserve was necessary to reflect potential reduction of the refund after examination of the returns by the irs 
no adjustments were recorded in to the contingency reserve established for these refund claims 
we also recorded  in  a million credit to income tax expense for the adjustment of deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable at a uk subsidiary 
a portion of this adjustment related to prior reporting periods  but was considered immaterial to those periods  therefore  the entire amount was reflected in if the million and million reductions had not been recorded  the effective income tax rate for would have been approximately 
no adjustments were recorded in to reflect a change in the estimates for these items 
income from affiliates and joint ventures we reported income from affiliates and joint ventures of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the major component of the increase for each of the last two years was largely related to our investments in two businesses based in india 
one business has substantial bauxite and bentonite operations 
bauxite is used to produce alumina  which is then used to produce aluminum 
the bauxite business had particularly strong earnings in the current year period 
the second business in india is engaged in manufacturing  marketing and distributing a specialized bentonite application involving clarification of edible oils 
that business  in which we own of the equity  has increased its revenues substantially over the last two years and is now a leading supplier in the indian market 
additionally  we increased our ownership percentage in our japanese joint venture in august to from  and we began accounting for the income from that venture under the equity method 
discontinued operations in september  we filed an amended income tax return in the state of mississippi requesting a refund of approximately million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of our absorbent polymer segment 
the sale of the segment was reported as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of with the assistance of a professional accounting firm  we concluded that a gain on the sale of a business under these circumstances was not taxable in mississippi according to its laws 
after negotiations and hearings with officials  the board of review of the mississippi state tax commission accepted our settlement offer of million in june  and we received payment of this refund in july discontinued operations reported in reflected the recording of a tax benefit associated with the disposal of our uk based metalcasting and cat litter businesses 
the disposal transactions were completed in on february   the internal revenue service notified us that audits of certain federal income tax returns  including  had been completed and approved by the committee on joint taxation 
the return included deductions for losses associated with the disposal of the aforementioned businesses 
upon receiving this notification  effective as of december   we revised our estimate of income taxes payable previously recorded to recognize an income tax receivable of million  including interest on the forthcoming refund 
the tax refunds were received in net income net income for was million compared with million and million and  respectively 
in and  net income included million and million  respectively  of a benefit from discontinued operations as previously discussed 
the increase in income from continuing operations in both comparison periods vs 
and vs 
was attributed to the increase in operating profit for the reasons described earlier in this report 
net income in was also positively impacted by the adjustments to income tax expense which reduced the overall effective tax rate as previously discussed 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock  including common share equivalents  outstanding during the year 
stock options issued to key employees and directors are considered common share equivalents 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding was approximately million in  million in and million in there were million shares outstanding  excluding common share equivalents  at december   compared with million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in shares in was due to exercise of stock options which was partially offset by stock repurchases 
the million share increase in was related to the issuance of shares of treasury stock to employees in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this increase was partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in were compared with and in and  respectively 
the improvement for both and was commensurate with the increase in net income from continuing operations previously described 
also benefiting  was a reduction of income tax expense  described above  which contributed approximately per share 
net income per diluted share was   and in  and  respectively 
both and were positively impacted by discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations  borrowings from a revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees have been our sources of funds to purchase property  plant and equipment  acquire businesses  repurchase common stock  and pay dividends to shareholders 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowings from an unused and committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to support our operating plans for the foreseeable future 
following is a discussion and analysis of our cash flow activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows within item of this report 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million  compared with million in and million in in  our cash flows benefited from higher income from continuing operations and slower growth in working capital 
the decline in was primarily attributed to cash used for working capital 
accounts receivable and inventories in increased by million over  they increased in by million over the increases were commensurate with our sales growth 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million in  compared with and million in and  respectively 
tax refunds provided by discontinued operations were million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in over was due to a number of new investment sites including a metalcasting products plant in the united states and a lining technologies manufacturing plant in spain 
capital expenditures increased in over primarily due to an acquisition of a vacant facility in the united states for million that we plan to use for consolidating certain manufacturing operations for our environmental segment 
the remaining portion of the increase in was due to further expansion of operations in asia 
acquisitions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we acquired two businesses related to our environmental segment 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in financing activities provided cash totaling million in financing cash flows are primarily affected by borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we had net borrowings of debt from the revolving credit facility totaling million in and net repayments of million in net borrowings were negligible in the increase in borrowings in was attributed to acquisitions and funding working capital growth 
net debt repayments in were the result of higher cash flow from operations and relatively lower spending on acquisitions 
acquisitions completed in were the primary reason for the net borrowings in that year 
as noted in item of this form k  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock in compared with million in and million in approximately million remains in funds authorized by our board of directors for stock repurchases 
we elect to repurchase our common stock in the open market from time to time when we believe utilizing funds in this manner will provide a good return to our shareholders 
dividends on our common stock were million in  compared with million in and million in declared dividends were per share in  compared with per share in to per share in the increases reflected the improvement in our earnings and cash flows from through as of december   we had outstanding debt of million and cash of million  compared with million of outstanding debt and million of cash at december  total funded debt represented of total capitalization at december   compared with at december  we had a current ratio of to and working capital of approximately million as of december   compared with to and million  respectively  as of december  the current ratio and working capital increased due to the growth in sales we experienced in since the mid s  we and or our subsidiaries have been named as one of a number of defendants in product liability lawsuits relating to the minor free silica content of our bentonite products used in the metalcasting industry 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are primarily employees of our foundry customers

the facility requires us to meet certain covenants  such as specific amounts of net worth  and limits our ability to make additional borrowings and guarantees

additional information regarding operating leases is disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report 
the company occasionally enters into unconditional purchase obligations which contemplate future  irrevocable payments under enforceable contracts which can not be cancelled without penalty 
such payments are excluded from the above table as they are entered into in the ordinary course of business  and we believe the anticipated expenditures associated with them are not material 
we have recorded million of liabilities to satisfy the land reclamation obligations discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenditures to satisfy these liabilities are excluded from the above table of contractual obligations as the timing of these payments are not contractually due until the expiration of individual mining permits  which are frequently renewed 
we anticipate our funding obligation for our defined benefit pension plan will approximate million in that amount principally represents contributions required by regulations or laws 
we have not presented this obligation or the obligation for future years in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in fair value of pension plan assets and actuarial assumptions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world  we are subject to certain market risks  including those related to foreign currency  interest rates and government actions 
we use a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments only for risk management and do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound  and the polish zloty 
we also have significant exposure to changes in exchange rates between the british pound and the euro and the polish zloty and the euro 
our various currency exposures often offset each other  providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
periodically  specific foreign currency transactions eg inventory purchases are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk 
as of december   we did not have any material foreign currency contracts outstanding 
interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt obligations 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the instruments actual cash flows are denominated in us dollars 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value us equivalent in thousands short term debt fixed rate interest rate long term debt variable rate us      average interest rate fixed rate thb    interest rate variable rate uk pound    average interest rate variable rate euro    average interest rate total      we periodically use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on debt securities 
these instruments allow us to change the characteristics of variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate 
interest rate differentials are paid or received on these arrangements over the life of the agreements 
at the end of and  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base 
we currently believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
our accounts receivable financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair value
