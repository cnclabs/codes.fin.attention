business developments and industry trends business development and strategy 
we have become a leader in the global automotive parts industry by capitalizing on the strength of our products  technological capabilities and systems integration skills 
over the last decade  we have experienced sales growth in many of our product lines due to an increasing focus by both governments and consumers on safety and fuel efficiency 
we believe that this trend is continuing as evidenced by ongoing regulatory activities and escalating fuel costs  and will enable us to experience growth in the most recent generation of advanced safety and fuel efficient products  such as vehicle stability control systems  curtain and side air bags  occupant sensing systems  electrically assisted power steering systems and tire pressure monitoring systems 
throughout our long history as a leading supplier to major oems  we have focused on products where we have a technological advantage 
we have extensive technical experience in a focused range of safety related product lines and strong systems integration skills 
these traits enable us to provide comprehensive  systems based solutions for our oem customers 
we have a broad and established global presence and sell to major oems across all of the world s major vehicle producing regions 
we believe our diversified business mitigates our exposure to the risks of any one geographic economy  product line or major customer concentration 
it also enables us to extend our portfolio of products and new technologies across our customer base and geographic regions  and provides us the necessary scale to optimize our cost structure 
industry trends 
the following key trends have been affecting the automotive parts industry over the past several years 
the statements regarding industry outlook  trends  the future development of certain automotive systems and other non historical statements contained in this section are forward looking statements 
asian oem market share 
in recent years  ford motor company  general motors corporation and  to a lesser extent  the chrysler unit of daimlerchrysler ag the big three have seen a steady 
table of contents decline in their market share for vehicle sales in north america and europe  with asian oems increasing their share in such markets 
although we do have business with the asian oems  our customer base is more heavily weighted toward the big three 
inflationary pressures and supply base 
our industry continues to experience increases in costs of resins  yarns and other petroleum based products  as well as higher energy costs 
costs of other commodities such as ferrous metals also remain a worry despite declines in costs from recent highs 
therefore  overall commodity inflation pressures remain a significant concern for our industry and business and have placed a considerable operational and financial burden on us and the industry 
we expect such inflationary pressures to continue 
in addition  the inflationary environment surrounding resins  yarns  petroleum based products and ferrous metals has resulted in concern about the viability of the tier and tier supply base as they face these inflationary pressures 
restructuring initiatives 
as a result of the market share losses and inflationary pressures discussed above  most major oems and tier suppliers have embarked upon multi year restructuring programs in order to realign their cost structures in the face of these issues 
some of these restructuring programs have involved reorganizations in bankruptcy 
escalating pricing pressures on automotive suppliers 
pricing pressure from customers has been a characteristic of the automotive supply industry in recent years 
this pressure has been substantial and is likely to continue 
virtually all oems have policies of seeking price reductions each year 
we and other suppliers have been forced to reduce prices in both the initial bidding process and throughout long term supply arrangements 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 
consumer and regulatory focus on safety 
consumers  and therefore oems  are increasingly focused on  and governments are increasingly requiring  improved safety in vehicles 
for example  the alliance of automobile manufacturers and the insurance institute for highway safety announced voluntary performance criteria which encompass a wide range of occupant protection technologies and designs  including enhanced matching of vehicle front structural components and enhanced side impact protection through the use of features such as side air bags  air bag curtains and revised side impact structures 
by september   at least of all vehicles offered in the united states by participating manufacturers are expected to meet the front to side performance criteria  and by september  of the vehicles of participating manufacturers are expected to meet the criteria 
in october  the national highway safety traffic administration nhtsa updated its mandate for the assembly onto vehicles of a direct tire pressure monitoring system  capable of detecting when one or more tires are significantly under inflated 
the phase in period for compliance is as follows of light vehicles are required to comply with the standard during the period from october  to august   during the period from september  to august   and all light vehicles thereafter 
in september  nhtsa released preliminary results of a study on the effectiveness of electronic stability control that indicated a dramatic reduction in single vehicle crashes for vehicles equipped with these systems 
advances in technology by us and others have led to a number of innovations in our product portfolio  which will allow us to benefit from this trend 
such innovations include electronic vehicle stability control systems  tire pressure monitoring systems  occupant sensing systems  rollover sensing and curtain air bag systems 
globalization of suppliers 
to serve multiple markets more cost effectively  many oems are manufacturing global vehicle platforms  which typically are designed in one location but are produced and sold in many different geographic markets around the world 
having operations in the geographic markets in which oems produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet oems needs more 
table of contents economically and efficiently 
few suppliers have this global coverage  and it is a source of significant competitive advantage for those suppliers that do 
shift of engineering to suppliers 
increasingly  oems are focusing their efforts on consumer brand development and overall vehicle design  as opposed to the design of individual vehicle systems 
in order to simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes and reduce their costs  oems increasingly look to their suppliers to provide fully engineered  combinations of components in systems and modules rather than individual components 
systems and modules increase the importance of tier suppliers because they generally increase the tier suppliers percentage of vehicle content 
we have also seen certain vehicle manufacturers shift away from their funding of development contracts for new technology 
we expect this trend to continue in  thereby causing our engineering and research and development expenses to increase 
increased electronic content and electronics integration 
the electronic content of vehicles has been increasing and  we believe  will continue to increase in the future 
consumer and regulatory requirements in europe and the united states for improved automotive safety and environmental performance  as well as consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality at lower cost largely drive the increase in electronic content 
electronics integration generally refers to replacing mechanical with electronic components and integration of mechanical and electrical functions within the vehicle 
this allows oems to achieve a reduction in the weight of vehicles and the number of mechanical parts  resulting in easier assembly  enhanced fuel economy  improved emissions control  increased safety and better vehicle performance 
as consumers seek more competitively priced ride and handling performance  safety  security and convenience options in vehicles  such as electronic stability control  active cruise control  air bags  keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring  we believe that electronic content per vehicle will continue to increase 
increased emphasis on speed to market 
as oems are under increasing pressure to adjust to changing consumer preferences and to incorporate technological advances  they are shortening product development times 
shorter product development times also generally reduce product development costs 
we believe suppliers that are able to deliver new products to oems in a timely fashion to accommodate the oems needs will be well positioned to succeed in this evolving marketplace 
competition the automotive parts industry is extremely competitive 
oems rigorously evaluate us and other suppliers based on many criteria such as quality  price cost competitiveness  system and product performance  reliability and timeliness of delivery  new product and technology development capability  excellence and flexibility in operations  degree of global and local presence  effectiveness of customer service and overall management capability 
we believe we compete effectively with leading automotive suppliers on all of these criteria 
for example  we generally follow manufacturing practices designed to improve efficiency  including but not limited to  one piece flow machining and assembly  and just in time scheduling of our manufacturing plants  all of which enable us to manage inventory so that we can deliver components and systems to our customers in the quantities and at the times ordered 
our resulting delivery performance  as measured by our customers  generally meets or exceeds our customers expectations 
within each of our product segments  we face significant competition 
our principal competitors include advics  bosch  continental teves  delphi  koyo seiko  visteon  and zf in the chassis systems segment  autoliv  bosch  delphi  key safety  and takata  in the occupant safety systems segment  and delphi  eaton  itw  kostal  nifco  raymond  textron  tokai rika  and valeo in the automotive components segment

our chassis systems segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of product lines relating to steering  foundation brakes  brake control  linkage and suspension  and modules 
we sell our chassis systems products primarily to oems and other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations and in the independent aftermarket  through a licensee in north america  and in the rest of the world  to independent distributors 
we believe our chassis systems segment is well positioned to capitalize on growth trends towards increasing active safety systems  particularly in the areas of electric steering  electronic vehicle stability control and other advanced braking systems and integrated vehicle control systems  and integration of active and passive safety systems 
occupant safety systems 
our occupant safety systems segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of air bags  seat belts  safety electronics  steering wheels and security electronic systems 
we sell our occupant safety systems products primarily to oems and also to other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations for service parts 
we believe our occupant safety systems segment is well positioned to capitalize on growth trends towards increasing passive safety systems  particularly in the areas of side and curtain air bag systems  occupant sensing systems  active seat belt pretensioning and retractor systems  and tire pressure monitoring systems  and integration of active and passive safety systems 
automotive components 
our automotive components segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of engine valves  body controls  and engineered fasteners and components 
we sell our automotive components products primarily to oems and also to other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations 
in addition  we sell some engine valve and body control products to independent distributors for the automotive aftermarket 
we believe our automotive components segment is well 
table of contents positioned to capitalize on growth trends toward multi valve engines and increasing electronic content per vehicle 
customers we sell to all the major oem customers across all of the world s major vehicle producing regions 
our long standing relationships with our customers have enabled us to understand global customers needs and business opportunities 
we believe that we will continue to be able to compete effectively for our customers business because of the high quality of our products  our ongoing cost reduction efforts  our strong global presence and our product and technology innovations 
although business with any given customer is typically split among numerous contracts  the loss of or a significant reduction in purchases by  one or more of those major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition

for each of the years ended december  and  our sales to the aftermarket represented approximately of our total sales 
we sell these products through both oem service organizations and independent distribution networks 
sales and marketing we have a sales and marketing organization of dedicated customer teams that provide a consistent interface with our key customers 
these teams are located in all major vehicle producing regions to best represent their respective customers interests within our organization  to promote customer programs and to coordinate global customer strategies with the goal of enhancing overall customer service and satisfaction 
our ability to support our customers globally is further enhanced by our broad global presence in terms of sales offices  manufacturing facilities  engineering technical centers  joint ventures and licensees 
our sales and marketing organization and activities are designed to create overall awareness and consideration of  and to increase purchases of  our systems  modules and components 
to further this objective  we participate in an international trade show in frankfurt 
we also provide on site technology demonstrations at our major oem customers on a regular basis 
customer support our engineering  sales and production facilities are located in countries 
with hundreds of dedicated sales customer development employees  we provide effective customer solutions  products and service in any region in which these facilities operate or manufacture 
joint ventures joint ventures represent an important part of our business  both operationally and strategically 
we have often used joint ventures to enter into new geographic markets such as china and india  or to acquire new customers or to develop new technologies such as direct tire pressure monitoring systems 

table of contents in the case of entering new geographic markets where we have not previously established substantial local experience and infrastructure  teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre existing infrastructure 
in addition  local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local customs and practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components 
all of these advantages can reduce the risk  and thereby enhance the prospects for the success  of an entry into a new geographic market 
joint ventures can also be an effective means to acquire new customers 
joint venture arrangements can allow partners access to technology they would otherwise have to develop independently  thereby reducing the time and cost of development 
more importantly  they can provide the opportunity to create synergies and applications of the technology that would not otherwise be possible

although our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve  no single patent  copyright  trade secret or license  or group of related patents  copyrights  trade secrets or licenses  is  in our opinion  of such value to us that our business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof 
however  we view the name trw automotive and primary mark trw as material to our business as a whole 
our general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis in the united states  germany and appropriate other countries to protect our patentable developments 
our portfolio of patents and pending patent applications reflects our commitment to invest in technology and covers many aspects of our products and the processes for making those products 
in addition  we have developed a substantial body of manufacturing know how that we believe provides a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace 

table of contents we have entered into numerous technology license agreements that either strategically exploit our intellectual property rights or provide a conduit for us into third party intellectual property rights useful in our businesses 
in many of these agreements  we license technology to our suppliers  joint venture companies and other local manufacturers in support of product production for our customers and us 
in other agreements  we license the technology to other companies to obtain royalty income 
we own a number of secondary trade names and marks applicable to certain of our businesses and products that we view as important to such businesses and products as well 
as part of the acquisition  we entered into intellectual property license agreements with old trw 
seasonality our business is moderately seasonal because our largest north american customers typically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december 
additionally  customers in europe historically shut down vehicle production during portions of august and one week in december 
as new models are typically introduced during the third quarter  automotive production traditionally is lower during that period 
accordingly  our third and fourth quarter results may reflect these trends 
research  development and engineering we operate a global network of technical centers worldwide where we employ approximately  engineers  researchers  designers  technicians and their supporting functions 
this global network allows us to develop automotive active and passive technologies while improving existing products and systems 
we utilize sophisticated testing and computer simulation equipment  including computer aided engineering  noise vibration harshness  crash sled  math modeling and vehicle simulations 
we have advanced engineering and research and development programs for next generation components and systems in our chassis  occupant safety and automotive component product areas 
we are disciplined and innovative in our approach to research and development  employing various tools to improve efficiency and reduce cost  such as six sigma  follow the sun a hour a day engineering program that utilizes our global network and other e engineering programs  and outsourcing non core activities 
company funded research  development and engineering costs totaled years ended december  dollars in millions research and development engineering total total research  development and engineering costs as a percentage of sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  we believe that continued research  development and engineering activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 
recently  we have seen certain vehicle manufacturers shift away from their funding of development contracts for new technology 
we expect this trend to continue  thereby causing our engineering and research and development expenses to increase 
manufactured components and raw materials we purchase various manufactured components and raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes 
the principal components and raw materials we purchase include castings  electronic parts  molded plastic parts  finished subcomponents  fabricated metal  aluminum  steel  resins  textiles  leather and wood 
all 
table of contents of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources 
we continue to see significant inflationary pressures in the cost of ferrous metals  resin yarn and other petroleum based products  as well as higher energy costs 
at this time  we are working with our suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact that this inflation may have on our financial results  but there can be no assurance that such continued inflation will not have a material adverse effect 
although we have not  in recent years  experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or raw materials  and normally do not carry inventories of these items in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedule  the possibility of shortages exist especially in light of the weakened state of the supply base described above 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees including employees of our majority owned joint ventures but excluding temporary employees and employees who are on approved forms of leave  of whom approximately  were employed in north america  approximately  were employed in europe  approximately  were employed in south america and approximately  were employed in asia 
approximately  of our employees are salaried and approximately  are hourly 
environmental matters governmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have had  and will continue to have  an effect on our operations and us 
we have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the environment  including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities 
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to comply with applicable requirements and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
a reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis 
in the determination of such costs  consideration is given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers  in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
at multi party sites  the reserve estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties 
as of december   we had reserves for environmental matters of million 
in addition  the company has established a receivable from northrop for a portion of this environmental liability as a result of the indemnification provided for in the master purchase agreement under which northrop has agreed to indemnify us for of any environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of old trw s automotive business existing at or prior to the acquisition  subject to certain exceptions 
during  we received approximately million under such environmental indemnification from northrop 
we do not believe that compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
our capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during and are not expected to be material to us 
we believe that any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient information 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on our financial position or results of operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the future 

table of contents item a 
risk factors deteriorating financial condition of certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 
certain of our customers are facing structural issues and negative industry trends resulting in deteriorating financial conditions 
some of these customers are addressing these problems through restructuring their businesses 
in some cases  this restructuring includes significant capacity reductions and or reorganization under bankruptcy laws 
substantial restructuring initiatives by our major customers could have a ripple effect throughout our industry and may impact our business and our common suppliers 
loss of market share by the big three may adversely affect our results in the future 
recently  the big three have been losing market share for vehicle sales in north america and europe 
at the same time  asian vehicle manufacturers have increased their share in such markets 
although we do have business with the asian vehicle manufacturers  our customer base is more heavily weighted towards the big three 
accordingly  if this trend of big three loss in market share continues and our share of business with other vehicle manufacturers does not increase  our results could be adversely affected 
escalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business 
pricing pressure in the automotive supply industry has been substantial and is likely to continue 
virtually all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the contract 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 
if we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures  those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
commodity inflationary pressures may adversely affect our profitability and the viability of our tier and tier supply base 
the cost of some of the commodities we use in our business has increased 
ferrous metals  resins  yarns and other petroleum based products have become more expensive 
this put significant operational and financial burdens on us and our suppliers in both and we expect this pressure to continue in we are working with our suppliers and customers to lessen the impact of increasing commodity costs 
however  it is usually difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases 
furthermore  our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost increases and still perform as we expect 
in fact  we have seen the number of bankruptcies or insolvencies increase due in part to the recent inflationary pressures 
while the unstable condition of some of our suppliers has not led to any significant disruptions so far  it could lead to delivery delays  production issues or delivery of non conforming products by our suppliers in the future 
our business would be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers 
for the year ended december   sales to our four largest customers on a worldwide basis were approximately of our total sales 
although business with each customer is typically split among numerous contracts  if we lost a major customer or that customer significantly reduced its purchases of our products  there could be a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
work stoppages or other labor issues at the facilities of our customers or other suppliers could adversely affect our operations 
the turbulence in the automotive industry and actions taken by our customers and other suppliers to address negative industry trends may have the side effect of exacerbating labor relations problems at those companies 
if any of our customers experience a material work stoppage  that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products 
similarly  a work stoppage at another supplier could interrupt production at our customer which would have the same effect 
this could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to 
table of contents those products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly 
a majority of our borrowings  including borrowings under trw automotive inc s senior credit facilities  are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was at variable interest rates 
if interest rates increase  the amount we are required to pay on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same 
continued strengthening of the us dollar could materially impact our results of operations 
in  over half of our sales originated outside the united states 
we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements 
this translation is based on average exchange rates during a reporting period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings would be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 
our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our substantial debt 
we have a significant amount of debt 
this amount of debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for our business 
it may also limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions because of the covenants and restrictions in the debt 
in addition  we have to devote substantial cash to the payment of interest and principal on the debt  which means that cash may not be used for other of our business needs 
we may be more vulnerable to an economic or industry downturn than a company with less debt 
the cyclicality of automotive production and sales could adversely affect our business 
automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions  consumer spending and preferences  labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
the volume of automotive production has fluctuated from year to year  which leads to fluctuations in the demand for our products 
any significant economic decline that results in a reduction in automotive production and sales by vehicle manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability  warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us 
in our business  we are exposed to product liability and warranty claims 
in addition  we may be required to participate in a recall of a product 
vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with product liability  warranty and recall claims 
in addition  vehicle manufacturers have experienced increasing recall campaigns in recent years 
product liability  warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our pension and other post retirement benefits expense and the funding requirements of our pension plans could materially increase 
most of our employees participate in defined benefit pension plans or retirement termination indemnity plans 
the rate at which we are required to fund these plans depends on certain assumptions which depend in part on market conditions 
as market conditions change  these assumptions may change  resulting in a decline in pension asset values 
future declines could materially increase the necessary funding status of our plans  and may require us to contribute more to these plans earlier than we anticipated 
also  this could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce our profitability 

table of contents we also sponsor other post retirement benefit opeb plans for most of our us and some of our us employees 
we fund our opeb obligations on a pay as you go basis and have no plan assets 
if health care costs in the future increase more than we anticipated  our actuarially determined liability and our related opeb expense could increase along with future cash outlays 
we are subject to risks associated with our non us operations 
we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states  including joint ventures and other alliances 
international operations involve risks  including exchange controls and currency restrictions  currency fluctuations and devaluations  changes in local economic conditions  changes in laws and regulations and unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against united states or other interests 
these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  which may become impaired in the future 
we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  trademarks and developed technologies 
goodwill and other net identifiable intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   or of our total assets 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired  was approximately billion as of december   or of our total assets 
impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from  among other things  deterioration in our performance  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business  and a variety of other factors 
the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge that is included in operating income 
we are subject to financial statement risk in the event that goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired 
our expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors 
the overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis 
losses in certain jurisdictions provide no current financial statement tax benefit 
in addition  certain taxing jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the united states 
as a result  changes in the mix of projected earnings between jurisdictions  among other factors  could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate 
we may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations or concerns 
laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
as a manufacturing company  we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the united states 
we may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times 
our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved  which difference may be material 
we have spent money to comply with environmental requirements 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries are subject to pending litigation raising various environmental and human health and safety claims  including certain asbestos related claims 
while our annual costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material  we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future 

table of contents developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 
we own significant intellectual property  including a large number of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements 
our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve 
developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 
because blackstone controls us  the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited  and conflicts of interest between blackstone and us or our public shareholders could arise in the future 
currently an affiliate of blackstone beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock and has reached an agreement with northrop pursuant to which northrop will vote its interest in us in accordance with blackstone s instructions 
as a result  blackstone has the power to control all matters submitted to our stockholders  elect our directors and exercise control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests

item legal proceedings various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against our subsidiaries  covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities with respect to commercial  patent  product liability  environmental and occupational safety and health law matters 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
accordingly  we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future 
in addition  our costs to defend the product liability claims have increased over time 
in october  kelsey hayes company formerly known as fruehauf corporation was served with a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney for the southern district of illinois 
the us attorney has informed us that the investigation relates to possible wrongdoing by kelsey hayes company and others involving certain loans made by kelsey hayes company s then parent corporation to fruehauf trailer corporation  the handling of the trailing liabilities of fruehauf corporation and actions in connection with the bankruptcy of fruehauf trailer corporation 
kelsey hayes company became a wholly owned subsidiary of old trw upon old trw s acquisition of lucas varity in and became our wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the acquisition

this matter was settled with a total payment from the company of  on january  while certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos related claims  we believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in general  these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by our subsidiaries 
we believe that the majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major us automobile manufacturers 
the vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos 
we believe that  to the extent any of the products sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos  the asbestos was encapsulated 
based upon several years of experience with such claims  we believe that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos related impairment 
neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our annual legal fees to defend these claims have been material in the past 
these claims are strongly disputed by us and it has been our policy to defend against them aggressively 
we have been successful in obtaining the dismissal of many cases without any payment whatsoever 
moreover  there is significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims 
however  while our costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material  we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

subsequent to the acquisition  trw automotive acquisition corp 
changed its name to trw automotive inc referred to herein as trw automotive 
our predecessor s interest in the joint venture  tks  was not transferred to us as part of the acquisition 
due to the change in ownership  and the resultant application of purchase accounting  our predecessor s pre acquisition financial statements and our post acquisition financial statements have been prepared on different bases of accounting that do not straddle the acquisition date  and therefore are not comparable 
for purposes of the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the results of operations of our predecessor for the two months ended february  prior to the acquisition  and our results of operations for the ten months ended december   have been combined for convenience of discussion and are collectively referred to as year ended december  on october   we completed our purchase of a interest in dalphi metal espana  sa dalphimetal  a european based manufacturer of airbags and steering wheels 
results of dalphimetal s operations have been consolidated into our results since the date of the acquisition 
executive overview our business 
we are among the world s largest and most diversified suppliers of automotive systems  modules and components to global automotive original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and related aftermarkets 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
these operations primarily encompass the design  manufacture and sale of active and passive safety related products 
active safety related products principally refer to vehicle dynamic controls primarily braking and steering  and passive safety related products principally refer to occupant restraints primarily air bags and seat belts and safety electronics electronic control units and crash and occupant weight sensors 
we are primarily a tier supplier  with over of our end customer sales in made to major oems 
we operate our business along three operating segments chassis systems  occupant safety systems and automotive components 

table of contents during  we achieved net sales growth of  to billion in from billion in the increase resulted primarily from a higher level of sales from new product areas and higher volumes on certain platforms  the consolidation of dalphimetal into our operations during the fourth quarter  and foreign currency translation  partially offset by pricing provided to customers and lower industry production volumes 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year operating income 
the decrease in operating income resulted from the continued impact of commodity inflation above prior year levels  markedly higher restructuring and asset impairment costs  and rising research and development costs 
the decrease in operating income was partially offset by a reduction in administrative and selling expenses due primarily to a reduction in litigation related reserves  and the benefit of higher sales and cost reduction programs in excess of pricing provided to our customers 
net earnings for were million as compared to million in results for included a loss on retirement of debt of million compared to losses on retirement of debt totaling million incurred in conjunction with various debt refinancing transactions during the unfavorable automotive climate 
we achieved our solid results despite continued unfavorable developments and trends in the automotive and automotive supply industries 
these developments and trends include a decline in market share for vehicle sales among some of our largest customers  including the big three  the deteriorating financial condition of certain of our customers and the resulting uncertainty as they undergo or contemplate undergoing restructuring initiatives  including in certain cases  possible significant capacity reductions and or reorganization under bankruptcy laws  continuing pricing pressure from oems  the continued rise in inflationary pressures impacting certain commodities such as resins  chemicals and yarns  despite declines in the cost of ferrous metals from recent all time highs  the growing concerns over the economic viability of our tier and tier supply base as they face inflationary pressures and financial instability in certain of their customers  and reduced customer funding of research and development projects 
the effect of these unfavorable trends and developments was mitigated by  among other things  our customer  product and geographic diversity 
we also benefited from sales growth  favorable foreign currency translation year over year and a continued emphasis on a high level of restructuring actions and targeted cost reductions throughout our businesses 
in recent years and throughout  the big three have seen a steady decline in their market share for vehicle sales in north america and europe  with asian oems increasing their share in such markets 
although we do have business with the asian oems  our customer base is more heavily weighted toward the big three 
further  certain of our customers are undergoing various forms of restructuring initiatives  including reorganization under bankruptcy laws in certain cases  to address certain structural issues specific to their companies and the same negative industry trends that we are experiencing 
substantial restructuring initiatives undertaken by our major customers  such as those recently announced by ford and gm  could have a ripple effect throughout our industry and may have an impact on our business and our common suppliers 
also  work stoppages or other labor issues that may potentially occur at these customers facilities may negatively affect us 
pricing pressure from our customers is characteristic of the automotive parts industry 
this pressure is substantial and will continue 
virtually all oems have policies of seeking price reductions each year 
consequently  we have been forced to reduce our prices in both the initial bidding process and during the terms of contractual arrangements 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have negatively impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 

table of contents during  we saw continued increases in costs of resins  yarns and other petroleum based products  as well as higher energy costs 
costs of other commodities such as ferrous metals also remain a worry despite declines in costs from recent highs 
therefore  overall commodity inflation pressures remain a significant concern for our business and have placed a considerable operational and financial burden on the company 
we expect such inflationary pressures to continue into the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we continue to work with our suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact of increasing commodity costs 
however  it is generally difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases 
furthermore  because we purchase various types of equipment  raw materials and component parts from our suppliers  we may be adversely affected by their failure to perform as expected as a result of being unable to adequately mitigate these inflationary pressures 
these pressures have proven to be insurmountable to some of our suppliers and we have seen the number of bankruptcies or insolvencies increase due in part to the recent inflationary pressures 
while the unstable condition of some of our suppliers has not led to any significant disruptions thus far  it could lead to delivery delays  production issues or delivery of non conforming products by our suppliers in the future 
as such  we continue to monitor our supply base for the best source of supply 
we have also seen certain vehicle manufacturers shift away from their funding of development contracts for new technology 
we expect this trend to continue in  thereby causing our engineering and research and development expenses to increase 
while we continue our efforts to mitigate the risks described above  there can be no assurances that the results of these efforts in both and will continue in the future or that we will not experience a decline in sales  significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies or increased costs or disruptions in supply  or that these items will not adversely impact our future earnings 
in particular  during  we will continue to evaluate the negative industry trends referred to above  including the deteriorating financial condition of certain of our customers and suppliers  and whether additional actions may be required to mitigate those trends 
such actions may include further plant rationalization and global capacity optimization efforts across our businesses 
our debt and capital structure 
on an ongoing basis we monitor  and may modify  our debt and capital structure to reduce associated costs and provide greater financial and covenant flexibility 
during and into  we made the following enhancements to our debt and capital structure on february   we repurchased all of our subsidiary lucas industries limited s million bonds due  for approximately million  or approximately million 
we funded the repurchase from cash on hand 
the repayment of debt resulted in a pretax charge of approximately million  or approximately million  for loss on retirement of debt  which will be recognized in our first quarter results 
on january   we reduced the committed amount of our us receivables facility from million to million due to decreased availability under the facility as a result of certain customer credit rating downgrades below investment grade 
this reduction in the funding amount reduces the fees on the unused portion of the facility 
on november   we completed the borrowing under the credit facility of an additional million through a term loan b we used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes 
on may   we repurchased approximately million principal amount of our senior notes with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock in the first quarter of we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of approximately million for the related redemption premium on the senior notes  and approximately million for the write off of deferred debt issue costs 
we may make further repurchases of notes or other debt securities from time to time as conditions warrant 

table of contents changes in our debt and capital structure  among other items  may impact our effective tax rate 
our overall effective tax rate is equal to consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis 
we are in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the united states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in future periods 
changes in tax law and rates could also have a significant impact on the effective rate in future periods 
restructuring in  we closed five manufacturing facilities  resulting in the outplacement of approximately  employees  and announced the closure of five additional manufacturing facilities to be closed in and 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
such expenses included cash charges of million for severance and other costs and million of non cash asset impairments related to restructuring actions  offset by million of net curtailment gains 
for the year ended december   we recorded charges of million for actions that resulted in the closing of two plants and employee reductions of approximately for the year ended december   the cash charges were million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities and the non cash charges were million 
for the ten months ended december   we recorded cash charges of million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities 
additionally  we recorded a million reserve through purchase accounting primarily for severance related to strategic restructurings  plant closings and involuntary employee termination arrangements outside of the united states to be paid over the next several years in accordance with local laws 
in connection with the acquisition  we assumed liabilities subject to certain exceptions totaling approximately million for various restructuring activities  primarily related to involuntary severance obligations and costs to exit certain activities 
during the two months ended february   the predecessor recorded cash charges of million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities 
critical accounting estimates the critical accounting estimates that affect our financial statements and that use judgments and assumptions are listed below 
in addition  the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions is noted 
product recalls 
we are at risk for product recall costs 
recall costs are costs incurred when the customer or we decide to recall a product through a formal campaign  soliciting the return of specific products due to a known or suspected safety concern 
in addition  the nhtsa has the authority  under certain circumstances  to require recalls to remedy safety concerns 
product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced  customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part 
during the predecessor periods  when a decision to recall a product had been made for which we bore some responsibility  we recorded the estimated cost to us of the recall as a charge to net earnings in that period  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
in making estimates relating to product recalls  judgment was required as to the number of units to be returned  the total cost of the recall campaign  the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and  in some cases  the extent to which our supplier would share in the recall cost 
as a result  our actual recall costs could be significantly different from our estimated costs 
effective as of the acquisition date  we implemented a new methodology for actuarially estimating our recall obligations that differs from that of the predecessor 
we engage independent third party actuaries to run loss histories for the purpose of establishing loss projections 
under the actuarial estimation methodology  we 
table of contents accrue for recalls when revenues are recognized upon shipment of product 
using an actuarial based estimation has the effect of better matching revenues and expenses as relative to the methodology employed by the predecessor 
compared with the predecessor  we will record higher expenses in a period of minor or no recalls and lower expenses in a period of significant recall since the obligation will have already been accrued as the revenue was recognized 
however  due to uncertainties related to the nature of recall claims  if future claims materially differ from actuarial projections which are based on historical performance  there could be a material effect on the accrual for recalls in future periods 
valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical losses  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we determined that we could not conclude that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain deferred income tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance we recorded reduced to zero the net carrying value of all united states and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
we expect the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in the united states and as a result of projected future taxable income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions 
environmental 
governmental regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have had  and will continue to have  an effect on our operations 
we have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the environment  including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities 
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to comply with applicable requirements and along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites 
a reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis 
in the determination of such costs  consideration is given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers  in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
at multi party sites  the reserve estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties 
each of the environmental matters is subject to various uncertainties  and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
we believe that any liability  in excess of amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements  that may result from the resolution of these matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates  will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient information 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters 
pensions 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination involves the selection of an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate 
the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations as of the end of the year and the net periodic benefit cost for the following year are as follows rest of rest of us us world us us world discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of increase in compensation levels 
table of contents the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december  and are shown in the following table years ended december  rest of rest of us us world us us world discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of increase in compensation levels based on our assumptions as of october   the measurement date  as discussed below  a change in these assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would have the following effect on our pension costs and obligations on an annual basis impact on net periodic benefit cost increase decrease us us all other us us all other dollars in millions 
change in discount rate 
change in expected long term rate of return impact on obligations increase decrease us us all other us us all other dollars in millions 
change in discount rate sfas and the policies we have used most notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets for pensions as further described below  generally reduce the volatility of pension income and expense that would otherwise result from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
a substantial portion of our pension benefits relate to our plans in the united states and the united kingdom 
for the years ended december  and  our net pension expense reflects a combination of a decreased long term rate of return assumption on the assets  decreased discount rate and use of fair value of plan assets as of march  in our purchase accounting  as opposed to the five year market related value used historically 
a key assumption in determining our net pension income expense in accordance with sfas is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually through comparison of our historical actual rates of return with our expectations  and consultation with our actuaries and investment advisors regarding their expectations for future returns 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension income expense 
the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return on assets to a calculated market related value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
in computing the expected return on plan assets that was included in the pension expense of the successor for the years ended december  and  and the ten month period ended december   the market related value of assets was reset at march  to equal the fair value of assets  in subsequent years  asset gains and losses will be amortized over five years in determining the market related value of assets used to calculate the expected return component of pension income 
the predecessor used this same methodology to calculate the expected return 

table of contents another key assumption in determining our net pension income expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency  and that have cash flows similar to those of the underlying benefit obligation 
our pension expense income is estimated to be approximately million in the us  million in the us and million for the rest of the world based on december  exchange rates 
during  certain amendments reducing future benefits for nonunion participants were adopted that will reduce future service costs 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our us pension plans and approximately million to our non us pension plans in other post retirement benefits 
we account for our other post retirement benefits opeb in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the following are the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the accumulated projected benefit obligations apbo as of the october measurement date us canada us canada discount rate initial health care cost trend rate at end of year ultimate health care cost trend rate year in which ultimate rate is reached the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the opeb liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency and that have cash flows similar to those of the underlying benefit obligation 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and through discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
changes in the assumed discount rate or health care cost trend rate can have a significant impact on our actuarially determined liability and related opeb expense 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects one percentage point increase decrease dollars in millions effect on total of service and interest cost components for the year ended december  effect on post retirement benefit obligations as of october  our opeb expense is estimated to be approximately million 
during  certain amendments reducing future benefits for nonunion participants were adopted that will reduce future service costs 
we fund our opeb obligation on a pay as you go basis 
we expect to contribute approximately million on a pay as you go basis in goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition  we applied the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired  was approximately billion as of december   or of our total assets 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform annual impairment testing at a reporting unit level 
to test goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  then a possible impairment of goodwill exists and requires further evaluation 
estimated fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units strategic plans and long range planning forecasts see impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
as the estimated fair values of our reporting units have exceeded their carrying values at each testing date since adoption of sfas in  we have recorded no goodwill impairment 
while we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable based upon current information and assumptions about future results  changes in our businesses  the markets for our products  the economic environment and numerous other factors could significantly alter our fair value estimates and result in future impairment of recorded goodwill 
we are subject to financial statement risk in the event that goodwill becomes impaired 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their fair value 
we also evaluate the useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry specific data 
we use external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources and market share data by customer based on known and targeted awards over a five year period 
the projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and additional impairment of assets might be required to be recorded 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair values to the carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on cash flows as discussed above  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
we are subject to financial statement risk in the event that intangible assets become impaired 
results of operations the following consolidated and combined statements of operations compare the results of operations for the years ended december   and due to the change in ownership  and the resultant application of purchase accounting  our predecessor s pre acquisition financial statements and our post acquisition financial statements have been prepared on different bases of accounting that do not straddle the acquisition date  and therefore are not comparable

debt and commitments sources of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
we also have availability under our revolving credit facility and receivables facilities described below  subject to certain conditions 
see off balance sheet arrangements and other receivables facilities 
our primary liquidity requirements  which are significant  are expected to be for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate purposes 
we intend to draw down on  and use proceeds from  the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facilities and our united states and european accounts receivables facilities collectively  the liquidity facilities to fund normal working capital needs from month to month in conjunction with available cash on hand 
as of december   we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility  approximately million and million under our european accounts receivable facilities and approximately million of availability under our us accounts receivable facility as further discussed below 
during any given month  we anticipate that we will draw as much as an aggregate of million from the liquidity facilities 
the amounts drawn under the liquidity facilities typically will be paid back throughout the month as cash from customers is received 
we may then draw upon such facilities again for working capital purposes in the same or succeeding months 
these borrowings reflect normal working capital utilization of liquidity 
in addition  dalphimetal and its subsidiaries have approximately million of credit facilities  of which million was available as of december  we expect that these facilities will be fully drawn from time to time for normal working capital purposes 
in connection with the acquisition by an affiliate of blackstone of the shares of the subsidiaries of old trw engaged in the automotive business from northrop  our wholly owned subsidiary trw automotive issued the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes  entered into senior credit facilities  consisting of a revolving credit facility and term loan facilities  and initiated a trade accounts receivable securitization program  or the receivables facility

we continuously evaluate our capital structure in order to ensure the most appropriate and optimal structure and may  from time to time  repurchase senior notes  senior subordinated notes or any other of our bonds in the open market or through redemption or retirement  if conditions warrant 
funding our requirements 
while we are highly leveraged  we believe that funds generated from operations and planned borrowing capacity will be adequate to fund debt service requirements  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and company sponsored research and development programs 
in addition  we believe that our current financial position and financing plans will provide flexibility in worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets 
however  our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic including difficulties in the automotive industry  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  and the cost of warranty and recall and litigation claims  among other things 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility or receivables facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs

under the terms of the transfer agreement  the borrower purchases all receivables sold to the transferor 
the borrower is a bankruptcy remote qualifying special purpose limited liability company that is wholly owned by the transferor and is not consolidated when certain requirements are met as further described below 
generally  multi seller commercial paper conduits supported by committed liquidity facilities are available to provide cash funding for the borrowers purchase of receivables through secured loans tranches to the extent desired and permitted under the receivables loan agreement 
the borrower issues a note to the transferor for the difference between the purchase price for the receivables purchased and cash borrowed through the facility 
the sellers of the receivables act as servicing agents per the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred receivables for which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
the usage fee under the facility is of outstanding borrowings 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee of on the unused portion of the receivables facility 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance and is determined by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the program  the historical rate of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that affect their eligibility such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor  delinquency and excessive concentration 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  this facility can be treated as a general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
whether the funding and related receivables are shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet  or  conversely  are removed from the consolidated balance sheet depends on the level of the multi seller conduits loans to the borrower 
when such level is at least of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets consisting principally of receivables sold by the sellers  the securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the receivables under the provisions of sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and are removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds received are included in cash flows from operating activities in the 
table of contents statements of cash flows 
costs associated with the receivables facility are recorded as accounts receivable securitization costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
the book value of our retained interest in the receivables approximates fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables 
however  at such time as the fair value of the multi seller commercial paper conduits loans are less than of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets  we are required to consolidate the borrower  resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as accounts receivable securitization costs 
as there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables facility on december   the fair value of the multi seller conduits loans was less than of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets and  therefore  the financial position and results of operations of the borrower were included in our consolidated financial statements as of december  other receivables facilities in addition to the receivables facilities described above as amended  certain of our european subsidiaries entered into receivables financing arrangements in december  january and december we have approximately million available for a term of one year through factoring arrangements in which customers send bills of exchange directly to the bank 
we also have two receivable financing arrangements with availabilities of million and million  respectively 
each of these arrangements is available for a term of one year and each involves a separate wholly owned special purpose vehicle which purchases trade receivables from its domestic affiliates and sells those trade receivables to a domestic bank 
these financing arrangements provide short term financing to meet our liquidity needs 
contingencies various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against our subsidiaries  covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities with respect to commercial  patent  product liability  environmental and occupational safety and health law matters 
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to comply with applicable requirements and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
a reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis 
in the determination of such costs  consideration is given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers  in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
at multi party sites  the reserve estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties 
as of december   we had reserves for environmental matters of million 
in addition  the company has established a receivable from northrop for a portion of this environmental liability as a result of the indemnification provided for in the master purchase agreement under which northrop has agreed to indemnify us for of any environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of old trw s automotive business existing at or prior to the acquisition  subject to certain exceptions 
during  we received approximately million under such environmental indemnification from northrop 
we believe that any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient information 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on our financial position or results of operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the future 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or is alleged to 
table of contents result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
accordingly  we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future 
in addition  our costs to defend the product liability claims have increased over time 
in october  kelsey hayes company formerly known as fruehauf corporation was served with a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney for the southern district of illinois 
the us attorney has informed us that the investigation relates to possible wrongdoing by kelsey hayes company and others involving certain loans made by kelsey hayes company s then parent corporation to fruehauf trailer corporation  the handling of the trailing liabilities of fruehauf corporation and actions in connection with the bankruptcy of fruehauf trailer corporation 
kelsey hayes company became a wholly owned subsidiary of old trw upon old trw s acquisition of lucas varity in and became our wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the acquisition 
we have cooperated with this investigation  but are not aware of any activity on this investigation since the fall of due to this inactivity  we no longer believe that this investigation is ongoing or will have a financial impact on the company 
while certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos related claims  we believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in general  these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by our subsidiaries 
we believe that the majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major us automobile manufacturers 
the vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos 
we believe that  to the extent any of the products sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos  the asbestos was encapsulated 
based upon several years of experience with such claims  we believe that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos related impairment 
neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our annual legal fees to defend these claims have been material in the past 
these claims are strongly disputed by us and it has been our policy to defend against them aggressively 
we have been successful in obtaining the dismissal of many cases without any payment whatsoever 
moreover  there is significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims 
however  while our costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material  we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
outlook for full year  we expect revenue in the range of to billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of to 
this guidance includes the approximate million charge related to the retirement of our subsidiary lucas industries limited s bonds 
this guidance range also reflects restructuring expenses of approximately million and includes the annualized effect for the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment recognition of expenses related to share based compensation 
lastly  we estimate capital expenditures will total approximately of sales for the year 
for the first quarter of  we expect revenue of approximately billion and earnings per diluted share ranging from breakeven to 
this guidance includes the previously discussed million loss on retirement of debt 
also included in earnings guidance are expected pre tax restructuring costs of approximately million 

table of contents the expected annual effective tax rate underlying our guidance is dependent on several assumptions  including the level and mix of future income by taxing jurisdiction  current enacted global corporate tax rates and global corporate tax laws remaining constant 
changes in tax law and rates could have a significant impact on the effective rate 
the overall effective tax rate is equal to consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis 
we are in a position whereby losses incurred in certain jurisdictions provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain taxing jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the unites states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix of projected earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate 
we are concerned about the ongoing financial health and solvency of our major customers as they address negative industry trends through various restructuring activities 
such restructuring actions  if significant  could have a negative impact on our financial results 
annually  we purchase large quantities of ferrous metals  resins and textiles for use in our manufacturing process either indirectly as part of purchased components  or directly as raw materials  and therefore we continue to be exposed to the recent inflationary pressures impacting the resin yarn  ferrous metal  and other commodity markets on a worldwide basis 
we are also concerned about the viability of the tier and tier supply base as they face these inflationary pressures and other financial difficulties in the current automotive environment 
we are monitoring the situation closely and where applicable are working with suppliers and customers to mitigate the potential effect on our financial results 
however  our efforts to mitigate the effects may be insufficient and the pressures may worsen  thus potentially having a negative impact on our financial results 
given the nature of our global operations  we maintain an inherent exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which has recently strengthened significantly against such currencies 
should this trend continue  it could have a negative impact on our results of operations due to our proportional concentration of sales volumes in countries outside the united states 
furthermore  variable rate indebtedness exposes us to the risk of rising interest rates 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligation on variable rate indebtedness would increase  even though amounts borrowed would remain unchanged

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our primary market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent commodity price risk  by utilizing various derivative instruments and limit the use of such instruments to hedging activities 
we do not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
if we did not use derivative instruments  our exposure to such risk would be higher 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  options are utilized to protect our cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates 
these derivative instruments are only used to hedge transactional exposures 
risks associated with translation exposures are not hedged 
transactional currency exposures are reviewed monthly and any natural offsets are considered prior to entering into a derivative financial instrument 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was in foreign currencies as compared to as of december  interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixed rate debt 
in order to manage interest costs  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate interest payment obligations over the life of the agreements 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in london inter bank offered rates libor 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was at variable interest rates as compared to as of december  sensitivity analysis 
we utilize a sensitivity analysis model to calculate the fair value  cash flows or income statement impact that a hypothetical change in market rates would have on our debt and derivative instruments 
for derivative instruments  we utilized applicable forward rates in effect as of december  to calculate the fair value or cash flow impact resulting from this hypothetical change in market rates 
the results of the sensitivity model calculations follow assuming a assuming a favorable increase decrease unfavorable in rates in rates change in dollars in millions market risk foreign currency rate sensitivity forwards long us fair value short us fair value debt foreign currency denominated fair value interest rate sensitivity debt fixed rate fair value variable rate cash flow swaps pay variable receive fixed fair value pay fixed receive variable fair value includes only the risk related to the derivative instruments that serve as hedges and does not include the related underlying hedged item or any other operating transactions 
the analyses also do not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed
