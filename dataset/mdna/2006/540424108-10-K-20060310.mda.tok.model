a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
cna analyzes securities on at least a quarterly basis 
part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below book value for those securities in an unrealized loss position

in many cases  the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset liability duration management 
as such  cna continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity 
cna believes it has sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset liability management process

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in these risks in the near term  including increases in interest rates  could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations or equity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a large diversified financial services company 
as such  we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on our earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our debt is denominated in us dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates  therefore  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
equity price risk we have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
we have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by our asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
our foreign transactions are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  british pounds and the european item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk monetary unit 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
commodity price risk we have exposure to commodity price risk as a result of our investments in gold options 
commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities 
commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous decrease of from their levels at december  and credit risk we are exposed to credit risk which relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline has exposure related to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by boardwalk pipeline to them generally under parking and lending services and no notice services 
boardwalk pipeline maintains credit policies intended to minimize this risk and actively monitors these policies 
average natural gas prices have increased dramatically in recent years 
this rise in gas prices has materially increased boardwalk pipeline s credit risk related to gas loaned to its customers 
the amount of gas loaned out at any one time by boardwalk pipeline over the past months at any one time to its customers has ranged from a high of approximately bcf at april  to a low of approximately bcf at december  assuming an average market price during december of of per mmbtu  the fair value of gas loaned out at december  would have been approximately million 
as of february   the amount of gas loaned out was approximately bcf and  assuming an average market price during february of of per mmbtu  the fair value of gas loaned out would be approximately million 
if any significant customer should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas it owes boardwalk pipeline  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
