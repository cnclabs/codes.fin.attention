our web based architecture provides reporting  security  performance and standards that are critical for web deployment 
our products can be deployed on company intranets to provide employees with information to make better  more cost effective business and management decisions 
leading companies and government organizations worldwide have chosen microstrategy as their enterprise business intelligence standard 
by integrating information from across the enterprise  solutions built on the microstrategy platform are designed to give analysts  managers and executives the critical insight they need to make better business and management decisions and to optimize their operations 
with extranet deployments  enterprises can use microstrategy to build stronger relationships by linking customers and suppliers via the internet 
microstrategy facilitates customer success with a comprehensive offering of consulting  education  technical support and technical advisory services for our customers and strategic partners 
industry background business intelligence software offers decision makers the opportunity to ask and answer questions about their use of data that has been captured but not yet fully exploited 
four key business needs have driven demand for business intelligence tools increased user access and scalability in the past  dissemination of information has been limited to a few power users or analysts 
now a wide range of information customers from customer service representatives to the ceo and from customers to suppliers demand and can benefit from the insight that business intelligence can provide 
the wide acceptance of the internet as an information source also has fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the web to tens of thousands of users across the enterprise 
increased data scalability increasing information generation  and in particular  the need to capture electronically and store every business transaction has made terabyte size data warehouses commonplace 
terabyte size data warehouses store one trillion bytes of data or more and are among the largest databases in the world 
since transaction level information is now routinely captured  organizations can struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores 
organizations need to view data within the operational context of the data making even the most detailed information meaningful and comprehensive to business users 
as a result  users want to be able to discover easily trends hidden in these very large databases  and verify these trends by reviewing the underlying transaction detail 
improved supply efficiency supplier transactions become more efficient with direct access to inventory and other related data 
for true vendor managed inventory and collaborative commerce systems  vendors need to have access to key information about how their products are performing against business metrics 
for example  vendors should be able to see how their products are selling in each geographic region so as not to over ship products that are slow moving or under ship products that are selling quickly 
by opening vendor performance information to the vendors themselves  buyers and sellers of goods and services become partners in the quest to optimize sales  margin and inventory 
improved distribution efficiency business partners collaborate more effectively with access to shared data 
by granting partners access to information such as the manufacturing pipeline and build schedule  partners can be more effective at satisfying demands of end customers and setting expectations 
furthermore  opening invoice and purchase order information to partners can enable them to reduce the overhead associated with channel management  resulting in cost savings and time efficiencies 
for example  notifying channel sales partners of changes in the manufacturing schedule allows them to reset end customer expectations or to increase selling activity 
the emergence and widespread acceptance of the internet as a medium of communication and commerce have changed the way businesses interact with each other and their customers by allowing businesses to establish new revenue streams  create new distribution channels and reduce costs 
simultaneously  the amount of corporate information stored in databases continues to grow exponentially  and companies are giving an increasing number of employees  customers and partners access to their information 
business intelligence tools are one of the gateways to this information 
for example  companies are using internet based systems to facilitate business operations  including sales automation  supply chain management  marketing  customer service and human resource management 
consumers are also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet  relying on the internet not only to make online purchases  but to perform price comparisons  analyze recommendations from like minded individuals  educate themselves about relevant products and offerings and enter into transactions that were once conducted face to face or via the telephone 
the integration of the internet into business processes and increased consumer sophistication create opportunities for companies to use business intelligence applications as part of a more dynamic business model 
factors driving demand for these applications include increased electronic capture of transaction  operational and customer information 
the rapid growth in the electronic capture of business information and the increased availability of related profile data on the parties or products involved in each transaction are providing businesses with a rich data foundation for performing various analyses and making decisions 
powerful data analysis and mining tools are required to sift through massive amounts of data to uncover information regarding customer interactions  trends  patterns and exceptions  in turn enabling organizations to provide superior service and products to customers 
need to create a personalized  one to one customer and or supplier experience while maintaining privacy 
many companies are initiating strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and or supplier based on individual needs and preferences  and earn their loyalty by providing superior service  security and convenience 
in order to successfully acquire  retain and upgrade customers  organizations need to understand their profiles  their transaction history  their past responses to marketing campaigns  and their interactions with customer service 
retrieving information from widely dispersed and complex data sources and providing a holistic view of the customer can be challenging 
at the same time  while businesses have the opportunity to collect a variety of information that could improve targeting  customers are increasingly concerned about the potential for loss or abuse of their privacy 
need to integrate online and traditional operations 
while there are substantial benefits to conducting business electronically  companies need to ensure that their online operations work in combination with their traditional operations 
companies are seeking to ensure that an order placed online can be reliably fulfilled according to the expectations of the customer and to develop and maintain consistent interactions with customers across different channels 
maintaining the integrity of  and enhancing  the customer experience are crucial to fostering customer loyalty and supply chain relationships 
increased openness of business intelligence applications to customers  suppliers and partners 
business intelligence systems are no longer confined to the organization 
today  companies are extending their business intelligence insight to suppliers  channel partners and customers via extranets 
business partners can have up to the minute access to sales histories  inventory status and billing information through their web browsers 
emergence of wireless internet and voice technologies 
information can be more valuable if there is untethered  ubiquitous access to the information 
an integrated platform reduces the need to rely on multiple vendors for these products and services 
this development is expected to generate new business opportunities for companies by providing an additional channel for existing services and creating opportunities to provide new services that can be delivered to any place and at any time to anyone that has access to a wireless device

the need for multiple business intelligence or reporting tools is minimized when users have access to all five styles for their enterprise business intelligence needs 
easy to use interface for business users 
microstrategy exposes all the sophisticated business intelligence applications to end users through easy to use intuitive what you see is what you get wysiwyg web interfaces 
this enables deployment to large user populations with minimal training required 
the user interface includes an array of one click actions embedded throughout the interface

interactive reporting 
microstrategy has extended the microstrategy reporting capability by making all reports and scorecards fully interactive 
business users can rearrange the organization of any report with simple drag n drop actions or by clicking on the toolbar icons to get views of the data  all from the same report and without requiring assistance from it 
integration of analysis in every report or scorecard 
microstrategy makes the same powerful analytic capability available directly from enterprise reports or scorecards automatically 
microstrategy delivers analytic integration to reporting users in two ways 
the first is by providing on line analytical processing olap capabilities directly to tables embedded within report documents  allowing business users to analyze the data within the table while staying within the bigger report document 
the second way allows users to drill from a report document to a dedicated analysis view that is optimized for conducting detailed analysis 
in both cases  the integration of reporting with analysis is automatic 
direct access to sap bw  microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase 
microstrategy incorporates a dynamic data access engine designed to access multi dimensional databases mddbs or olap cube databases  such as those from sap business warehouse bw  microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase 
microstrategy s dynamic multi dimensional expressions mdx engine generates mdx syntax that is fully certified with sap bw using sap s high performance business api interfaces 
because microstrategy s mdx is dynamically generated using the multidimensional models implicit in sap infocubes  querycubes and ods databases  users can automatically and transparently drill back into sap bw for more data  without any prior programming or prior design of drill paths 
microstrategy can also join data across sap bw infocubes and querycubes as well as access multiple instances of sap bw and non sap sources at once 
in addition  microstrategy s dynamic mdx engine generates mdx syntax against microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase using the xmla xml for analysis standard for communication 
xmla is a new standard for accessing multidimensional data jointly developed by members of the xmla council 
as with sap bw  microstrategy s mdx is dynamically generated using the multidimensional models implicit in microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase cubes 
because of this  users can automatically drill back to underlying source data without any additional programming or drill path design 
users of sap bw  microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase databases each can access these reports through all of the microstrategy interfaces  microstrategy web  office  narrowcast server  and desktop  just like any other microstrategy report 
these reports offer standard olap functionality including graphing  subtotals  pivot  sort and page by 
direct access to operational data from enterprise resource planning erp systems 
microstrategy extends the microstrategy metadata architecture to include attributes and facts accessed directly from non modeled databases  instantly on a query by query basis 
microstrategy s operational sql engine enables microstrategy reports to include data from any operational system using either completely free form structured query language sql or a graphical query builder interface  including stored procedures and views 
since the attributes and facts from operational database sources are managed by the microstrategy metadata architecture  microstrategy s security architecture and other reusable objects such as prompts can be applied automatically 
heterogeneous joining of data from across the enterprise 
microstrategy extends the microstrategy data modeling flexibility to include integrated views of data across heterogeneous data stores 
by mapping conforming dimensions from different sources within the microstrategy object model  microstrategy can automatically join data from multiple different sources in the same report document

in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
our competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include  among others  actuate  business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  information builders  and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  including ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag and others 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain product support and other services revenue from our installed customer base 
research and product development we have made  and continue to make  substantial investments in research and product development 
we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
as of december   our research and product development staff consisted of employees  of whom are working on our core business intelligence projects and of whom are working on research and development relating to our non core businesses 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of the total of  employees  were engaged in sales and marketing  in research and development  in technical support  consulting and education services  and in finance  administration and corporate operations 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we believe that effective recruiting  education and nurturing of human resources are critical to our success and have traditionally made investments in these areas in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition  increase employee loyalty and create a culture conducive to creativity  cooperation and continuous improvement 
all newly hired technical and sales professionals complete a professional orientation course that ranges from one day to four weeks long  presented by microstrategy university  our in house education function 
the curriculum consists of lectures  problem sets and independent and group projects  covering data on our products  competitors and customers 
certain lectures also deal with general business practices  ethics and teamwork 
throughout this training  students typically must pass a number of oral and written examinations in order to begin their assignments 
course content for microstrategy university is created by experienced members of our professional staff  who generally have an annual obligation to update course content based upon the best practices they have most recently observed in the field 
this expert content is then used to upgrade and revitalize our education  consulting  support  technology and marketing operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing microstrategy 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  in part  as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  the timing of new product announcements by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  the length of our sales cycles  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  our use of direct and indirect distribution channels  utilization of our consulting and education services  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our profitability and expectations for future profitability and its effect on our deferred tax assets and net income for the period in which any adjustment to our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be made  seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new sales in the summer  and changes in customer budgets 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
the trading price for our class a common stock has been and may continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock historically has been volatile and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  new products  significant contracts  commercial relationships or capital commitments  the emergence of new sales channels in which we are unable to compete effectively  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  commencement of  or our involvement in  litigation  any major change in our board or management  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates  announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations  the likelihood of which may be enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance relating to our anticipated financial performance in future periods  announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations  the volume of shares of class a common stock available for public sale  sales of stock by us or by our stockholders  short sales  hedging and other derivative transactions involving shares of our class a common stock  and general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our class a common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we face the risk of a decrease in our cash balances and losses in our investment portfolio our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
a portion of our cash is invested in marketable securities as part of our investment portfolio 
among other factors  changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and macroeconomic conditions could cause our cash balances to fluctuate and losses in our investment portfolio 
most amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income tax  less applicable foreign tax credits 
revenue recognition accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported results of operations we continuously review our compliance with all new and existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements 
depending upon the outcome of these ongoing reviews and the potential issuance of further accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines and interpretations  we may be required to modify our reported results  revenue recognition policies or business practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our existing revenue recognition policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes and non income taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment 
moreover  in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and european and other governmental restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
business disruptions could affect our operating results a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a single geographic area 
we are also a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
a major earthquake  fire  act of terrorism or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we use strategic channel partners and if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition to our direct sales force  we use strategic channel partners such as value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to license and support our products 
for the years ended december   and channel partners accounted for  and  respectively  of our total product licenses revenues 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including products that compete with ours 
because our channel partners generally do not have an exclusive relationship with us  we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources to selling our products 
moreover  divergence in strategy or contract defaults by any of these channel partners may materially adversely affect our ability to develop  market  sell or support our products 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product licenses revenues  we seek to maintain a significant level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners 
there can be no assurance that our strategic partners will continue to cooperate with us when our distribution agreements expire or are up for renewal 
in addition  there can be no assurance that actions taken or omitted to be taken by such parties will not adversely affect us 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our strategic partners 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods our current and long term deferred revenue and advance payments were million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on various factors  including our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future we generated net income for the fiscal years ended december  and  however  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly or revenues fall below our expectations  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we have significant deferred tax assets  and if we are unable to sustain profitability  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets  which would result in a charge that would adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred 
managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition we receive a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales from foreign direct and indirect operations 
international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  export restrictions and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products  lack of acceptance of localized products  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in and costs of staffing  managing and operating our international operations  tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  weaker intellectual property protection  economic weakness or currency related crises  the burden of complying with a wide variety of laws including labor laws  generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures  and political instability in the countries where we are doing business 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which could reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while it seeks internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size and or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements can vary widely 
implementing our product can take several months  depending on the customer s needs  and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
our customers include the us government and a number of other us state and local governments or agencies procurement 
contracting with public sector customers is highly competitive and can be time consuming and expensive  requiring that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract 
budgetary constraints and cycles 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability  with funding reductions or delays adversely impacting public sector demand for our products and services 
modification or cancellation of contracts 
public sector customers often have contractual or other legal rights to terminate current contracts for convenience or due to a default 
if a contract is cancelled for convenience  which can occur if the customer s product needs change  we may only be able to collect for products and services delivered prior to termination 
if a contract is cancelled because of default  we may only be able to collect for products and services delivered  and we may be forced to pay any costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products and services 
governmental audits 
us government and other state and local agencies routinely investigate and audit government contractors 
if these audits determine that we have failed to comply with any of the complex laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of fees  fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and information delivery are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
our competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include  among others  actuate  business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  information builders and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  including ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag and others 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties  and the loss of this technology could impair our software  delay implementation of our products  or force us to pay higher license fees we license third party technologies that we incorporate into our existing products 
there can be no assurance that the licenses for such third party technologies will not be terminated or that we will be able to license third party software for future products 
in addition  we may be unable to renegotiate acceptable third party license terms 
changes in or the loss of third party licenses could lead to a material increase in the costs of licensing or to our software products becoming inoperable or their performance being materially reduced  with the result that we may need to incur additional development costs to ensure continued performance of our products  and we may experience a decreased demand for our products 
we depend on revenue from a single suite of products our microstrategy suite of products accounts for a substantial portion of our revenue 
because of this revenue concentration  our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for  or in the prices of  our microstrategy software as a result of  among other factors  any change in our pricing model  increased competition  a maturation in the markets for these products or other risks described in this document 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been subject to other litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time and require significant research and development expenditures to develop and test new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements  nor can we be sure that any new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  even if we introduce such a product  we may experience a decline in revenues of our existing products that is not fully matched by the new product s revenue 
in addition  we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor s product rather than migrate to our new product 
this could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and materially affect our business 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect the demand for our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our products 
microstrategy currently supports sql and mdx standards in database access technology 
if we are unable to adapt our products on a timely basis to new standards in database access technology  the ability of microstrategy s products to access customer databases could be impaired 
in addition  the emergence of new standards in the field of operating system support could adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
microstrategy technology is currently compatible with nearly all major operating systems  including  among others  windows server  sun solaris  ibm aix  hp s hp ux and redhat linux as 
if a different operating system were to gain widespread acceptance  we may not be able to achieve compatibility on a timely basis  resulting in an adverse effect on the demand for our products 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors and or defects 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in our products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue  damage to our reputation or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may also have to expend resources and capital to correct these defects 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability  warranty and other claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions and we may be exposed to product liability  warranty and other claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products  services and brand we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual commitments to protect our proprietary information 
despite our efforts  these measures can only provide limited protection 
unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property 
any patents owned by us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights we periodically receive notices from others claiming we are infringing their intellectual property rights  principally patent rights 
we expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products overlap  and the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming  costly and or result in litigation  divert management s time and attention from developing our business  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products  or require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
on october   we filed a lawsuit in the virginia circuit court for fairfax county against two field employees of business objects  sa this lawsuit alleged that these employees  who previously worked for us  breached their fiduciary and contractual obligations to us by  among other things  misappropriating our trade secrets and confidential information and soliciting our employees and customers 
the complaint sought injunctive relief and monetary damages 
on october   business objects filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  claiming that our software infringes a patent issued to business objects relating to relational database access the patent 
the suit sought injunctive relief and monetary damages 
on august   the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit  ruling as a matter of law that our products do not infringe the patent 
business objects filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on january   the federal circuit ruled that the district court had correctly construed the patent  that we do not literally infringe any of the asserted patent claims  and that business objects is legally barred from claiming that our products infringe two of the three asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents 
as a result of the federal circuit s ruling  the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings limited solely to business objects one remaining patent claim  and limited solely to the doctrine of equivalents 
the federal circuit also reinstated all of our non infringement and invalidity counterclaims brought against business objects that the district court had not needed to address or decide 
on july   the district court granted our motion for summary judgment of non infringement and dismissed the lawsuit 
on august   business objects filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
that appeal remains pending and is being briefed by the parties 
on october   we filed suit against business objects  sa and its subsidiary  business objects americas  inc  in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  claiming that business objects software infringes two patents held by us relating to asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser the patent and a system and method of adapting automatic output of olap reports to disparate user output devices the patent 
the complaint sought monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on march   we voluntarily dismissed without prejudice our lawsuit pending in the virginia circuit court for fairfax county against the two field employees of business objects 
the complaint against business objects was amended to add claims for violations of the federal computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference with contractual relations and violations of the virginia conspiracy act 
as a result of pre trial rulings  certain of these claims were dismissed 
our claims for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets proceeded to trial on october  on october   the court dismissed the tortious interference claim 
in july  the united states patent trademark office confirmed the validity of all the claims in the and patents and terminated reexamination proceedings that business objects had requested as to those patents 
we agreed to dismissal of the patent claims without prejudice

because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing holders of class b common stock  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without the approval of our board of directors or our other stockholders  prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy  or limit your ability to influence corporate matters we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock

saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and by laws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of whom are current employees or former employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without the approval of our board of directors or our other stockholders  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
in addition  this concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that our non controlling stockholders do not view as beneficial 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition  valuation of net deferred tax assets  litigation and contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  intangible assets and provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
microstrategy does not have any material ownership interest in any special purpose or other entities that are not wholly owned and or consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  microstrategy does not have any material related party transactions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 related party disclosures 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
microstrategy s software revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of software  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also follow the guidance provided by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement  as provided by agreements  contracts  purchase orders  or other arrangements  generally executed by both parties other than certain customer specific instances in which we have a customary business practice of accepting orders without signed agreements  delivery of the software  and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is reasonably assured 
when the fees for software upgrades and enhancements  technical support  consulting and education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled for revenue recognition purposes using our objective evidence of the fair value of the elements represented by our customary pricing for each element when sold separately 
if such evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the elements where evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of an arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop when a software license arrangement requires us to provide significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product licenses revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under percentage of completion accounting  both product licenses and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses based upon labor hours incurred 
any expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the period in which the losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method were not material for the years ended december   and if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or the acceptance period lapses  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver specified future products or upgrades  revenue is recognized when the specified future product or upgrades are delivered or when the obligation to deliver specified future products expires  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
license revenue derived from sales to resellers or oems who purchase our products for resale is recognized upon sufficient evidence that the products have been sold to the ultimate end users provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
product support revenue is derived from providing technical software support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
product support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from consulting  education and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred revenue and advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the application of sop  as amended  requires judgment  including a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed and determinable  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
litigation and contingencies 
we are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are involved in lawsuits with business objects  sa and business objects americas  inc relating to claims involving patent infringement and other intellectual property matters 
the outcome of this litigation is not presently determinable  and as such  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  relating to these actions 
accordingly  no provision for these matters has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding these matters is included under item a 
risk factors 
we are also involved in other legal proceedings through the normal course of business 
management believes that any unfavorable outcome related to these other proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
as a global company with subsidiaries in many countries  we are required to calculate and provide for estimated income tax liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax obligations and exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the future recoverability of deferred tax assets 
changes in the estimated level of annual pre tax income  changes in tax laws particularly related to the utilization of net operating losses in various jurisdictions  and changes resulting from tax audits can all affect the overall effective income tax rate which  in turn  impacts the overall level of income tax expense and net income 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would reduce income in the period such determination was made

provision benefit for income taxes 
during we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
of the million provision  million was related to deferred taxes and was primarily related to the non cash use of domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
in  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million caused primarily by the release of a valuation allowance related to our net operating loss tax assets  as described below 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and other temporary differences  carryforwards  and credits  which resulted in net deferred tax assets of million 
we have domestic net operating loss carryforwards of million that begin to expire in  and million of foreign loss carryforwards that begin to expire in also  as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million relating to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and domestic capital loss carryforward tax assets that we expect will expire unused 
we currently do not have plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings 
accordingly  we expect to accrue a deferred tax liability less any applicable foreign tax credits on undistributed foreign earnings at such time as we have cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and an excess of the financial reporting basis in foreign subsidiaries over the tax basis of such subsidiaries 
currently there is an excess of the tax basis over the financial reporting basis for which no deferred tax asset has been recorded 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca included a temporary incentive section for us companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an elective dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
in the third quarter of  we repatriated million from our bermuda subsidiary as a qualified section dividend 
the dividend resulted in a cash tax of million  after use of an alternative minimum tax credit of million 
the ajca also included a qualified manufacturing deduction that applies to domestic manufacturers  including software companies 
the deduction  when fully phased in  will provide a deduction of up to of qualified manufacturing income 
the deduction cannot be claimed by companies in a net operating loss carryforward position  therefore  we did not claim a benefit related to the qualified manufacturing deduction 
we have not quantified the impact of the qualified manufacturing deduction that we can use once the net operating loss carryforward has been fully used 
pursuant to the provisions of the internal revenue code irc  an ownership change involving or greater shareholders occurred in may the irc provides an annual limitation on the amount of net operating losses and tax credits that may be used in the event of an ownership change 
the limitation is based on  among other things  the value of the company as of the date of change multiplied by a federal long term tax exempt rate 
we do not currently expect the limitations under the irs ownership change rules to impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  we have not established a valuation allowance in related to this issue 
during  we recognized a net benefit for income taxes of million 
this benefit included a million release of valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense incurred in our foreign operations 
based upon our cumulative operating results and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration 
as a result  during  we released million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
of the million  million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations  and million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises  which was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the balance sheet 
the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations during the third and fourth quarters of was million 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the income tax benefit in included a million reduction of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in certain foreign subsidiaries that continued to demonstrate profitability 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense incurred in our foreign operations 
also during  we recognized a deferred tax asset of million primarily related to domestic tax losses and certain other items 
however  we recorded a full valuation allowance on this benefit 
deferred revenue and advance payments 
deferred revenue and advance payments represents product support and other services fees that are collected in advance and recognized over the contract service period and product licenses revenues relating to multiple element software arrangements that include future deliverables 
the following table summarizes deferred revenue and advance payments in thousands  as of december  current deferred product licenses revenue deferred product support revenue deferred other services revenue less billed and unpaid deferred revenue non current deferred product licenses revenue deferred product support revenue deferred other services revenue less billed and unpaid deferred revenue we offset our accounts receivable and deferred revenue for any billed and unpaid items included in deferred revenue and advance payments 
the increase in deferred revenue and advance payments in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to an ongoing increase in product support contracts associated with new product licenses sales  an increase in the average rate charged for product support and our high renewal rates of such contracts during including billed and unpaid deferred revenue  we expect to recognize million of deferred revenue and advance payments over the next months  however  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our performance of various service obligations  and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period 
during we entered into certain agreements that include future commitments by our customers to purchase products  product support or other services over multi year periods 
revenue relating to such future commitments by our customers is not included in our deferred revenue balances as of december    and we do not expect revenue from multi year arrangements will constitute a substantial percentage of our total revenue in future periods 
revenue relating to such agreements will be recognized during the period in which all revenue recognition criteria are met 
the timing and ultimate recognition of any revenue from such customer purchase commitments depend on our customers meeting their future purchase commitments and our meeting our associated performance obligations related to those purchase commitments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term and long term investments 
we generally invest our excess cash in short term  highly rated  fixed rate financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if interest rates increase 
as of december  we held auction rate securities that could expose us to interest rate risk 
although the company purchases these securities to hold for a short period of time  typically less than days  the underlying securities are long term municipal and corporate bonds with maturities ranging from twenty to thirty years 
the securities are repriced through the dutch auction process  generally every   or days 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
based on our overall currency rate exposure in foreign jurisdictions  a change in foreign exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
for instance  if average exchange rates in had changed unfavorably by  our total revenues and net income could have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risk by converting our excess foreign currency held in foreign jurisdictions to us dollar denominated cash and investment accounts 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations
