item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read with our financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains trend analysis and might contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results might differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in risk factors 
overview we provide daily processing  assembly and delivery of reusable and disposable products and instruments required for surgery through our state of the art  fda regulated service centers 
our integrated closed loop process starts with daily delivery of reusable and disposable surgical supplies and instruments to the healthcare provider 
at the same time  we pick up the textiles  basins and instruments used in surgery and return them to our processing facility 
used products arriving at our processing facility are sorted  cleaned  inspected  packaged sterilized  and subsequently  shipped back to the healthcare providers 
our principal strategic opportunity to improve our operating results is to capitalize on our strong service capabilities and considerable infrastructure by leveraging our current relationships with existing customers and adding new customers 
we plan to continue to focus on introducing our current and potential new customers to our physician specific readycase sm case cart management system 
we believe that our readycase sm growth strategy is a strong strategy 
we have undertaken significant efforts to identify  recruit  and train new sales resources to help us fully execute these strategies 
we believe our facilities are strategically situated to capitalize on future market opportunities 
these facilities have significant available capacity to access more of the national market 
we continue to seek ways to better maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating processes 
we derive our revenue from the sale and servicing of reusable and disposable surgical products and instruments 
reusable products include linens gowns  towels and drapes and basins stainless steel cups  carafes  trays and basins 
we sell our products and services through a direct sales force strategically located throughout the united states 
our revenue growth is primarily determined by the number of customers  the number and type of surgical procedures that we service for each customer  and pricing for our various types of surgical packs and procedures 
revenues are recognized as the agreed upon products and services are delivered  generally daily 
packing slips signed and dated by the customer evidence delivery of product 
our contractual relationships with our customers are primarily evidenced by purchase orders or service agreements with terms varying from one to five years  which are generally cancelable by either party 
we incur most of our cost of revenues from processing the reusable surgical products and instruments at our processing facilities 
we amortize the cost of our reusable surgical products over their expected useful life based upon usage 
we have implemented rfid technology into our reusable linen products to reduce shrinkage  monitor product quality testing and improve handling efficiencies 
most of our surgical instrument supply arrangements with customers utilize instruments owned by aesculap  which receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure based on the number and kinds of procedures performed with its instruments and the number and combination of instruments used for each procedure 
this arrangement allows us to limit our cost of capital for instrument programs 
in addition to the aesculap owned instruments  we purchase surgical instruments from other vendors to service customers who have requirements that aesculap cannot fulfill 
surgical instruments that we own are depreciated over a four year life 
our profitability is primarily determined by our revenues  the efficiency with which we deliver products and services to customers  and our ability to control our costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions 
note b to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods that we use in preparing our financial statements 
we identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the overall aging of the balances  and the financial stability of the customer 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates or customer defaults run at a rate higher than historical experience  we would increase this allowance  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
reserves for shrinkage  obsolescence  and scrap for reusable surgical products and instruments 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of our reusable surgical products and instruments based on historical experience 
any linen products not scanned by our rfid system for a day period are considered lost and written off 
we determine our reserve for scrap based upon quality assurance standards and historical evidence 
we periodically verify the quantity of other reusable surgical products by counting and by applying observed turn rates 
a third party  aesculap  owns most of the surgical instruments that we use 
we base our reserve for owned surgical instrument losses on our assessment of our historical loss experience  including periodic physical counts 
using different estimates or assumptions could produce different reserve balances for our reusable products and instruments 
we review this reserve quarterly 
if actual shrinkage  obsolescence or scrap differs from our estimates  our reserve would increase or decrease accordingly  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence for inventories 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of our inventories based on historical data  including the results of cycle counts performed during the year and the evaluation of the aging of finished goods of reusable and disposable surgical products and instruments 
using different estimates or assumptions could produce different reserve balances 
we review this reserve quarterly 
if actual losses differ from our estimates  our reserve would increase or decrease accordingly  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
amortization of reusable surgical products and instruments 
our reusable surgical products are stated at cost 
we amortize linens and basins on a basis similar to the units of production method 
estimated useful lives for each product are based on the estimated total number of available uses for each product 
the expected total available usage for our linen products using the three principal fabrics accounting for approximately of the reusable surgical products is   and uses  based on several factors  including our actual historical experience with these products 
we believe our rfid technology enables us to evaluate the useful lives of linen products more often 
basins are amortized over their estimated useful life  which ranges from to uses 
in  we amortized owned surgical instruments on the straight line method based on a four year useful life 
if our actual use experience with these products is shorter than these assumptions  our amortization rates for reusable products and instruments would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
health insurance reserves 
we offer employee benefit programs including health insurance  to eligible employees 
we retain a liability up to  annually for each health insurance claim 
we accrue health insurance costs using estimates to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
using different estimates or assumptions could produce different reserve balances 
if actual claim results exceed our estimates  our health insurance reserve would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
workers compensation insurance reserve 
in  we converted our workers compensation insurance program to a large dollar deductible  self funded plan 
we retain a liability of  for each claim occurrence 
our policy has an annual aggregate liability limit of million 
we have obtained a letter of credit in the amount of  with our primary lender to secure the payment of future claims 
we base our reserve on historical claims experience and reported claims 
we accrue workers compensation insurance costs using estimates to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we review this reserve quarterly 
if actual claims differ from our estimates  the reserve would increase or decrease accordingly  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided using the liability method in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change 
the tax benefits must be reduced by a valuation allowance in certain circumstances 
realization of the deferred tax benefits is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carry forwards 
we periodically review deferred tax assets for recoverability  and provide valuation allowances as necessary 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
we will be first required to apply sfas r during our fiscal quarter ending march  the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
as originally issued in  sfas established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  sfas permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed the impact on net income if the preferable fair value based method had been used 
we are evaluating the impact that sfas r will have on our operating results 
based on a preliminary analysis  we expect to incur approximately  of added compensation expense in results of operations we operate on a week fiscal year ending the sunday nearest december st 
the financial statements are reflected as of december   and for presentation purposes only 
the actual end of each period was january   january  and december   respectively 
there are weeks included for the years ended december  and  and weeks included for the year ended december  the following table sets forth for the periods shown the percentage of revenues represented by certain items reflected in our statements of income years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit distribution expenses selling and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our readycase sm delivery system combining instruments  reusable textiles  and disposable products  partially offset by declining sales of reusable surgical products to customers who predominantly purchase reusable textiles 
our revenues were also adversely affected by our having three less business days in the fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit gross profit increased  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased by to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower production labor cost  lower fixed overhead costs  and lower amortization of reusable products  partially offset by higher material costs for disposable products due to generally higher prices and higher instrument usage fees due to the increase in our instrument processing business 
distribution expenses distribution expenses increased  or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year primarily because of higher fuel costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses for is primarily attributable to lower compensation  insurance  and depreciation expenses  partially offset by increased sales and marketing expense 
impairment of goodwill in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million net of tax related to the entire carrying value of our goodwill at december  see note d to our financial statements goodwill 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due primarily to generally higher interest rates and a write off of fees associated with the former line of credit that was replaced in june income tax expense income tax expense  a function of our income before taxes and effective tax rate was  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was compared to for the year 
see note i to our financial statements income tax 
net income loss per common share we recorded net income per common share of on a diluted and basic per share basis for compared with net loss per common share of in the net loss for included a non cash charge to operations of million net of tax or per common share due to the impairment of goodwill from previous acquisitions 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to growth in our instrument processing programs and an extra week of operations in fiscal in  we successfully reduced the rate of our customer losses while achieving revenue growth from our existing core customer base 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased  to in  from in the increase in gross profit dollars reflects the growth in our instrument business offset slightly by the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
the radio frequency identification rfid technology implemented in our reusable processing facilities enabled us to eliminate labor intensive bar code scanning and better identify product usage in these benefits were partially offset by the continued impact of pricing pressures and increased costs of health insurance claims and workers compensation insurance 
we were also negatively impacted by a need to reserve additional slow moving rsp products 
distribution expenses distribution expenses increased  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenues  distribution expenses decreased  to in  from in the increase in distribution expense dollars resulted primarily from an extra week of operations for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  we were able to reduce our vehicle insurance costs and better leverage our distribution routes in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased  to in  from in the overall increase in expense is primarily due to severance expense from the employment termination of the former ceo in september impairment of goodwill we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million net of tax related to the entire carrying value of our goodwill in see note d to our financial statements goodwill 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased  or  to million in  from million in the decrease can be attributed to a reduction in the outstanding balance of the credit facility from million at december   to million at december   offset slightly by the increase in overall interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense decreased  from  in to  in income tax expense is usually a function of our net income loss and effective tax rate 
during  certain state tax credits were deemed unrecoverable resulting in an additional valuation allowance being applied against our deferred tax assets 
this determination was made after extensive review of the future recoverability of the state tax credits 
see note i income tax 
net loss per common share we recorded a net loss per common share of on a diluted and basic per share basis for compared with a net loss per common share of in the net loss for included a non cash charge to operations of million net of tax or per common share from impairment of goodwill from previous acquisitions 
this impairment charge was partially offset by an increase in revenues primarily attributable to growth in our instrument processing programs and an extra week of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of capital have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to approximately  as of december  in addition  we had million available under our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for last year 
the decrease in cash from operations in is primarily attributable to a substantial payment in of an accounts payable incurred in this decrease was offset partially by improved collections of accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the decrease in cash used in investing activities in as compared to  is attributable to reduced purchases of reusable surgical products offset by a slight increase in investment in property  plant and equipment 
we estimate that our expenditures in for reusable surgical products will be approximately million  an amount that will fluctuate depending on the growth of our business 
we estimate that our expenditures in for property  plant and equipment will be approximately million  including approximately million to replace our existing it infrastructure with an enterprise resource planning erp system 
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million compared to million in  primarily as a result of repayments toward our revolving credit facility and proceeds from issuance of common stock 
we have a three year revolving credit facility with two financial institutions that allows us to potentially draw up to million  subject to limitations based on the consolidated leverage ratio covenant 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and bears an interest rate that varies between and basis points over libor as of december  depending on the quarterly results under our consolidated leverage ratio covenant 
the credit facility requires us to maintain a a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than to for the fiscal quarter ending december   to for fiscal quarter ending march   and to for fiscal quarters ending june  and thereafter  b a funds flow coverage ratio of not less than to for the fiscal quarters ending december  and thereafter  c a tangible net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning june   of at least million plus of cumulative net positive income generated after march  the credit facility places a number of restrictions on us  including the paying of dividends  incurring additional indebtedness  making loans and investments  encumbering our assets  entering into a new business  and entering into certain merger  consolidation or liquidation transactions 
we complied with all requirements of the credit facility for all periods presented 
our outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was approximately million and million on december   and december   respectively 
as of december   we had million total available to be borrowed under the facility  which takes into consideration the amounts already outstanding 
in december  we purchased our tampa corporate headquarters facility for approximately million 
we financed the purchase with a mortgage from our primary lenders for approximately million and borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
the mortgage has a term of five years and an amortization schedule based on years  with a balloon payment of million in the mortgage bears an interest rate of basis points over libor 
we previously recorded the building as a capital lease in our financial statements 
in accordance with fasb interpretation  accounting for purchase of a leased asset by the lessee during the term of the lease  the difference  if any  between the purchase price and carrying amount of the lease obligation was recorded as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the asset on our balance sheet 
at the closing  the carrying amount exceeded the purchase price by  the building is being depreciated over its remaining useful life of years 
in  we issued public bonds to fund the construction of two of our reusable processing facilities 
interest expense adjusts based on rates that approximate libor 
starting in  we began amortizing the bonds through quarterly payments of  balloon principal payments of million are due on the bonds in the bonds payable are secured by the two reusable processing facilities 
letters of credit issued by a financial institution back these bonds 
we paid a commitment fee of approximately  basis points for the letters of credit in the letters of credit must be renewed each year through maturity in 
table of contents our contractual cash obligations for future minimum payments  including interest  under our notes payable to bank  bonds payable  mortgage and operating leases as of december   are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period s total less than year years years after years notes payable to bank  mortgage and bonds payable operating leases total contractual cash obligations as part of our readycase sm delivery system  we offer instruments for use and reprocessing pursuant to our joint marketing agreement with aesculap 
under the terms of this agreement  aesculap furnishes and repairs the surgical instruments that we deliver to customers and receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure 
we also have a procurement agreement with standard textile under which we agree to purchase of our reusable surgical products from them 
although we are not bound to purchase any minimum quantity of products under these agreements  we expect to make payments under the contracts to fulfill our supply requirements 
during  our payments under these agreements were million 
we expect to spend between and million in amounts paid under these agreements will vary based upon changes in customer demand  amortization rates  product prices  and other variables affecting our business 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  the cash we generate from operations  together with the revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our operations for at least the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility were approximately million and million on december  and december   respectively 
the credit facility s interest rate varies between and basis points over libor as of december   depending on our leverage ratio earnings coverage of debt 
we are subject to changes in our interest expense on this facility based on fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming an outstanding balance of this facility of million  if libor were to increase decrease by basis points  our interest payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
the outstanding balance under our real estate mortgage was approximately million as of december  the mortgage bears an interest rate of basis points over libor 
assuming an outstanding balance of this facility of million  if libor were to increase decrease by basis points  our interest payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
interest on our bonds that financed two of our facilities is at a rate that approximates libor 
we are subject to changes in our interest expense on these bonds based on fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming an outstanding balance of these bonds of million  if libor were to increase decrease by basis points  our interest payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
we do not have any other material market risk sensitive instruments
