sop establishes accounting standards for producers or distributors of films  including changes in revenue recognition  capitalization and amortization of costs of acquiring films and television programs and accounting for exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing expenses 
we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including financing costs and production overhead  to investment in films and television programs 
these costs are amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with sop these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized films or television program costs or estimated fair value 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
for previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library  ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years from the date of acquisition 
management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue and cost estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale or licensing of films and television programs is recognized upon meeting all recognition requirements of sop revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on the company s participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of videocassettes and dvds in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns and 
table of contents other allowances  is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when the company is entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred  as required under the sales contract  and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced 
for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks  the fee is allocated to the various media based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
rental revenue from short term operating leases of studio facilities is recognized over the term of the lease 
cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until all the conditions of revenue recognition have been met 
long term  non interest bearing receivables are discounted to present value 
reserves 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
we estimate reserves for video returns based on previous returns and our estimated expected future returns related to current period sales on a title by title basis in each of the video businesses

the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not or a valuation allowance is applied 
goodwill 
on april   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment within each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of december in each fiscal year 
the company performed its annual impairment test on its goodwill as of december  no goodwill impairment was identified in any of the company s reporting units 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires various assumptions and estimates 
business acquisitions 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions as a purchase  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires various assumptions and estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards staff position in march  the fasb ratified the measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsp 
the fsp nullifies certain requirements of eitf issue and supersedes eitf topic d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
the fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that 
table of contents impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of the fsp will not have a material effect on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle including voluntary changes 
previously  changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
the company will adopt this pronouncement beginning in fiscal year and does not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r revises sfas no 
and eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting under apb no 
sfas r requires all public companies accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments to account for these types of transactions using a fair value based method 
the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method as set forth in apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  the company generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use apb no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss available to common shareholders and basic and diluted income loss per share in note p 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
the company has not yet determined which method it will utilize 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for financial statements with the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  however  the sec announced on april  that it would provide for a phased in implementation process for sfas no 
r 
as a result  the company is not required to apply sfas no 
r until the period beginning april  eitf issue no 
during the year ended march   the company adopted eitf issue no 
the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  which applied to reporting periods ending after the effective date of december  under eitf issue no 
 all instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingent on market conditions indexed to an issuer s share price are included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market conditions have been met 
on october   lions gate entertainment inc sold the notes 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time prior to maturity  upon satisfaction of certain conversion contingencies  into common shares of lions gate entertainment corp  and therefore the notes would be included in diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended march  and if dilutive

the decrease in stock based compensation expense consists of a decrease in share appreciation rights expense of million fiscal included a recovery of sars expense of million and fiscal included an expense of million  offset by an increase in amortization of unearned compensation expense on restricted share units granted during the year ended march  of million 
the company did not grant any restricted share units in any period prior to the year ended march  the decrease in stock based compensation expense was further offset by an increase in professional fees primarily due to fees associated with the documentation  assessment and testing of our internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act
