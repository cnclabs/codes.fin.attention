con edison of new york is a subsidiary of con edison and  as such  information in this md a about con edison of new york applies to con edison 
information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein 
the use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made 
corporate overview con edison s principal business operations are those of its utility companies  con edison of new york and orange and rockland utilities  inc o r  together known as the utilities 
con edison also has competitive businesses that compete primarily in energy related businesses see competitive energy businesses  below

con edison s net income for common stock in was million or a share 
net income for common stock in and was million or a share and million or a share  respectively 
the results reflect increased energy sales and deliveries  the electric rate plan that took effect in april and the gas and steam rate plans that took effect in october see results of operations summary  below 
con edison s principal business segments are con edison of new york s regulated electric  gas and steam utility activities  o r s regulated electric and gas utility activities and con edison s competitive businesses 
con edison of new york s principal business segments are its regulated electric  gas and steam utility activities 
for segment financial information  see note o to the financial statements and results of operations  below 
for information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the companies  see risk factors  below 
regulated utilities con edison of new york provides electric service to approximately million customers and gas service to approximately million customers in new york city and westchester county 
the company also provides steam service in parts of manhattan 
o r  along with its regulated utility businesses  provides electric service to approximately million customers in southeastern new york and adjacent areas of northern new jersey and eastern pennsylvania and gas service to over million customers in southeastern new york and adjacent areas of eastern pennsylvania 
the utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the utilities customers buy this energy from the utilities  or from other suppliers through the utilities retail access programs 
the utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets  and recover generally on a current basis the cost of the energy sold  pursuant to approved rate plans 
con edison anticipates that the utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years 
the utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service  including a return on invested equity capital 
the factors affecting demand for utility service include weather  market prices for energy and economic conditions 
because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability  the utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions  as well as forecast growth in peak usage 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued the utilities had estimated prior to the summer of that  under design weather conditions  the peak electric demand in their respective service areas would be  mw for con edison of new york and  mw for o r 
on july   the electric demands served by the utilities reached new record peaks   mw for con edison of new york  and  mw for o r 
the higher than forecasted demands were primarily due to increased customer demand and actual temperatures that were slightly higher than those used in developing the forecast 
also  on july   the nyiso invoked demand reduction programs 
without these reduction programs  the experienced peak demands would have been higher 
the average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately percent for con edison of new york and percent for o r 
since demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances  design conditions do not include their potential impact 
the companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that the utilities currently provide see liquidity and capital resources capital requirements  below 
the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers 
con edison of new york s electric  gas and steam rate plans are effective through march   september  and september   respectively 
the company has filed a request for a new steam rate plan to be effective october  o r has rate plans for its electric and gas services in new york that extend through october  o r has filed a request for a new gas rate plan to be effective november  pursuant to the utilities rate plans  charges to customers may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply  for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions 
the rate plans generally require the utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity 
changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income except to the extent that weather normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses and subject to provisions in the rate plans for sharing above target earnings with customers

at december   con edison s investment in its competitive energy businesses was million and their assets amounted to billion 
consolidated edison solutions  inc con edison solutions sells electricity to delivery customers of the utilities and other utilities primarily in the northeast and mid atlantic regions and also offers energy related services 
the company sold approximately million megawatt hours of electricity to customers in consolidated edison development  inc con edison development owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects

risk factors the companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
these risk factors include the utilities revenues and results of operations reflect regulatory actions the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers 
the prices generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions 
the rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards 
certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates  which may include approval of new plans with different provisions 
regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans 
the regulators in the states in which the utilities provide service generally permit the utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service  other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred 
the utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations 
see application of critical accounting polices and regulatory matters  below 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued con edison s ability to pay dividends or interest is subject to regulatory restrictions con edison s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses 
the dividends that the utilities may pay to con edison are generally limited to not more than percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis  with certain exceptions 
see dividends in note c to the financial statements 
the companies purchase energy for their customers a disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the companies results of operations 
the companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply  including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterparty s non performance 
the utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel  purchased power and gas costs  including the cost of hedging transactions  in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators 
con edison s competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks 
see financial and commodity market risks commodity price risk  below 
energy market prices have increased significantly the impact of higher energy market prices on the companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the utilities recover energy supply costs 
however  higher energy market prices are resulting in significant increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage 
if this were to occur  the companies would have decreased energy delivery revenues 
the higher prices of electricity  fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of con edison s competitive energy businesses generating facilities 
the utilities have a substantial ongoing utility construction program the utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed billion over the next three years 
the ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission and distribution system projects 
the failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide 
the utilities expect to use internally generated funds  equity contributions from con edison and external borrowing to fund the construction expenditures 
changes in capital market conditions or in the companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds 
the companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by moody s investors services  inc moody s  standard poor s ratings services s p and fitch ratings fitch 
the current ratings are shown in liquidity and capital resources capital resources  below 
the companies operate essential energy facilities and other systems the utilities provide electricity  gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in  or close to  public places 
a failure of  or damage to  these facilities could result in bodily injury or death  property damage  the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions 
the companies have information systems relating to their operations  billing  accounting and other matters  the failure of which could adversely affect the companies operations and liquidity 
in the event of failure or damage to these facilities or systems  the utilities could incur substantial liability  higher costs and increased regulatory requirements 
the utilities have training  operating  security  maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities and information systems 
con edison s competitive energy businesses are in evolving markets con edison s competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies  other organizations such as independent system operators and other competitive businesses 
compared to the utilities  the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of con edison s investment in these competitive businesses is not as predictable 
the companies may be affected by the application of critical accounting policies and rules the application of the companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
these policies  which are described in application of critical accounting policies  below  include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities  the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other post retirement benefits  and accounting for contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
new accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies  rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities 
con edison is engaged in a material legal proceeding with northeast utilities in  con edison sued northeast utilities to recover damages from its breach of the merger agreement with them and to seek the court s declaration that con edison had no further obligations under the merger agreement 
northeast utilities alleges con edison breached the merger 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued agreement and has been pursuing a counter claim against con edison for damages in excess of billion 
there are also claims by purported classes of northeast utilities shareholders seeking damages from con edison that the company believes to be substantially duplicative of those sought by northeast utilities 
see note h to the financial statements 
the companies are exposed to risks relating to environmental matters hazardous substances  such as asbestos  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and coal tar  have been used or produced in the course of the utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them 
see environmental matters  below and note g to the financial statements 
electric and magnetic fields emf are found wherever electricity is used 
if a causal relationship between emf and adverse health effects were established  there could be a material adverse effect on the companies 
negative perceptions about emf can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the companies operations 
the companies are subject to extensive government regulation and taxation the companies operations require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
the companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the internal revenue service  which has completed its audits of the tax returns through  does not or may not agree 
see notes k and m to the financial statements 
the companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the companies 
the companies face weather and other risks that are beyond their control the companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather  which directly influences the demand for electricity  gas and steam and can affect the price of energy commodities 
the cost of repairing damage to the companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events could be substantial 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the new york or united states economy 
a lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could adversely affect the companies revenues and earnings and limit the companies future growth prospects 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts 
words such as expects  estimates  anticipates  intends  believes  plans  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made  and accordingly speak only as of that time

application of critical accounting policies the companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies  which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
accounting for regulated public utilities sfas no 
the utilities are subject to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and the accounting requirements of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction 
sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
the utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in note b to the financial statements 
the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received 
the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued in the event that regulatory assets of the utilities were no longer probable of recovery as required by sfas no 
 these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings 
at december   the regulatory assets for con edison and con edison of new york were billion and billion  respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees 
con edison s competitive businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees 
the companies account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in applying these accounting policies  the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  discount rates  health care cost trends and future compensation 
see notes e and f to the financial statements for information about these assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for  and primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains  con edison of new york s pension expense for  and was negative  resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year 
investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a year period percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years 
this amortization is in accordance with the statement of policy issued by the new york state public service commission psc and is permitted under sfas no 
the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods 
con edison s and con edison of new york s current estimates for are increases  compared with  in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of million and million  respectively 
the increases reflect the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years  a change in the discount rate assumption from percent in to percent in and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets from percent in to percent in generally  to the extent pension and other postretirement benefit costs vary from the amounts reflected in rates for such costs  the difference will be deferred in accordance with current rate agreements 
see note b to the financial statements 
amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to increase con edison s and con edison of new york s pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional million in a percentage point variation in the actual annual return in  as compared with the expected annual asset return of percent would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for con edison and con edison of new york by approximately million in the discount rate is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated aa and aaa  by moody s corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments 
due to declines in bond yields and interest rates  the company reduced the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit costs to compared to and in and  respectively 
in determining the health care cost trend rate  the company reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued the following table illustrates the effect on pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above  while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant actuarial assumption change in assumption pension other postretirement benefits total millions of dollars increase in accounting cost discount rate con edison con edison of new york expected return on plan assets con edison con edison of new york health care trend rate con edison n a con edison of new york n a increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate con edison con edison of new york health care trend rate con edison n a con edison of new york n a pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which con edison of new york  o r and the competitive businesses make contributions for their participating employees 
pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets 
an actuarial valuation of con edison s and con edison of new york s plan funded status as of december   showed that the fair value of the plan s assets exceeded the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo by million and  respectively  at that date 
however  the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plan s abo in future years 
in that event  each of the companies would be required  under sfas no 
 to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the abo  plus  in the case of con edison of new york  its total prepaid pension costs  through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income oci 
the charge to oci  which would be net of taxes  would not affect net income for common stock 
the companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in under funding regulations and tax laws 
however  con edison of new york  o r and con edison s competitive businesses made discretionary contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to the plan in in  con edison of new york  o r and con edison s competitive businesses expect to make discretionary contributions of million  million and million  respectively 
the companies policy is to fund their pension and postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  applies to an existing condition  situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
known material contingencies  which are described in the notes to the financial statements  include the utilities responsibility for hazardous substances  such as asbestos  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations note g  certain tax matters notes k and m  legal proceedings relating to con edison s merger agreement with northeast utilities note h  and other contingencies note i 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 
the utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits  workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans 
changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings 
accounting for long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
under sfas no 
an 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows  and exceeds its fair value  which approximates market value 
con edison s competitive businesses test their assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
a critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets 
forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations  which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy related and telecommunications businesses 
under sfas no 
 if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows  the probability of all possible outcomes must be weighted 
with respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with con edison development s generation facilities  a percent decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not result in an impairment charge 
as a result of the tests performed in  con edison recognized impairment charges of million million after tax for the assets of its competitive telecommunications and generation businesses 
no impairments were identified by the tests 
as a result of the tests  con edison recognized impairment charges of million million after tax with respect to its telecommunications assets 
in order to establish the fair value of the assets  the agreement to sell con edison communications to rcn for million was used 
see note u to the financial statements 
accounting for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  con edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment 
see note l to the financial statements 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill of million at december   was most recently tested for impairment during the first quarter of this test did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment 
the company s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
the company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows 
a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values 
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments 
the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments 
see financial and commodity market risks  below and note p to the financial statements 
where the companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas no 
 the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources 
accounting for leases the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions 
see note k to the financial statements for information about con edison development s lease in lease out or lilo transactions  a disallowance of tax losses by the internal revenue service and a possible future charge to earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 con edison accounted for the two lilo transactions as leveraged leases 
accordingly  the company s investment in these leases  net of non recourse debt  is carried as a single amount in con edison s consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive  based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases 
liquidity and capital resources the companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued the principal factors affecting con edison s liquidity are its investments in the utilities  the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities 
in addition  in and  con edison issued million and million shares of common stock for and million  respectively  of which million and million were invested in con edison of new york 
con edison also issued million of five year debt in  most of the proceeds of which were invested in its competitive businesses 
the principal factors affecting con edison of new york s liquidity are its cash flows from operations  cash used in investing activities including construction expenditures and cash flows from financing activities discussed below 
con edison of new york s expenditures have included approximately million related to the attack on the world trade center and the subsequent restoration of lower manhattan energy services and facilities  to date the company has received reimbursement of million of such costs from insurance carriers and million from the federal government and is pursuing further reimbursement of such costs 
see note i to the financial statements 
the companies current liabilities exceeded their current assets at december   and the companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements 
the companies repay their short term borrowings using funds from long term financings and operating activities 
the utilities cost of capital  including working capital  is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers 
each of the companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements

variance vs 
operating activities investing activities financing activities net change for the period balance at beginning of period balance at end of period cash flows from operating activities the utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations 
the volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the utilities  such as weather and economic conditions 
the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans 
in general  changes in the utilities cost of purchased power  fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
net income is the result of cash and non cash or accrual transactions 
only cash transactions affect the companies cash flows from operating activities 
principal non cash charges include depreciation  con edison s impairment charges in and  and in charges in accordance with con edison of new york s rate plans 
for con edison of new york  principal non cash credits included prepaid pension costs and in  amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities  including the tax

see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and notes e and f to the financial statements 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison and con edison of new york were million and million lower  respectively  than in the decrease reflects primarily prepayment of new york city property taxes and an increase in customer accounts receivable  offset in part by increases in accounts payable 
the increase in prepayments reflects a new york city program under which con edison of new york achieved a percent reduction in its city property taxes for the fiscal year ending june  by prepaying the taxes on june  instead of paying them in semi annual installments on their due dates july  and january

from time to time certain parties have petitioned the psc to review these provisions  the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
to reduce the volatility of electric energy costs  the utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the nyiso s wholesale electricity market  which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in see notes j and p to the financial statements 
o r s new jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in con edison of new york also owns generating stations in new york city associated primarily with its steam system

financial and commodity market risks the companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets 
the most significant market risks include interest rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk and investment risk 
interest rate risk the interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities 
con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt 
the companies estimate that each percent variation in interest rates applicable to con edison s and con edison of new york s variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of million and million  respectively 
in addition  from time to time  con edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
see interest rate hedging in note p to the financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued commodity price risk con edison s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity  gas and related derivative instruments 
the utilities and con edison s competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures 
see note p to the financial statements 
con edison estimates that  as of december   each percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas  of which million is for con edison of new york and million is for o r 
con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased 
in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators  the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers  including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
con edison s competitive energy businesses use a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments  physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments 
var represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
these businesses estimate var across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent confidence level 
since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience  it is not necessarily indicative of future results 
var for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts  assuming a one day holding period  for the years ended december   and  respectively  was as follows confidence level  one day holding period millions of dollars average for the period high low credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the competitive energy businesses 
credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
the companies use credit policies to manage this risk  including an established credit approval process  monitoring of counterparty limits  netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements 
the companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff 
the utilities had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral and reserves  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties and million was with the new york mercantile exchange 
con edison s competitive energy businesses had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral and reserves  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties and million was with commodity exchanges or independent system operators 
the remaining million was with entities which lacked ratings or whose ratings were not investment grade 
investment risk the companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  above 
the companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of percent equities and percent fixed income and other securities 
at december   the pension plan investments consisted of percent equity and percent fixed income and other securities 
see note e to the financial statements 
environmental matters for information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos  see note g to the financial statements 
impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation 
regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs 
the impact is  however  partially offset by the repayment of the companies long term debt in dollars of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed 
also  to the extent the companies prices change by more or less than inflation  the real price of the companies services will increase or decline 
over the past years  for example  the real price of electric service has declined substantially 
material contingencies for information concerning potential liabilities arising from the companies material contingencies  see application of critical accounting policies accounting for contingencies and notes g  h  i  k and m to the financial statements 
results of operations results of operations reflect  among other things  the companies accounting policies see application of critical accounting policies  above  rate plans that cover the rates the utilities can charge their customers see regulatory matters  above and demand for utility service 
demand for utility service is affected by weather  economic conditions and other factors 
the companies results of operations for the months ended december  reflect higher net revenues resulting from the warmer than normal summer weather  growth in energy deliveries and the con edison of new york electric rate plan that became effective april  and gas and steam rate plans that became effective october  the higher net revenues were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses  and a reduction in net credits for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
in addition  depreciation and property taxes were higher in  reflecting large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure 
for con edison  results of operations also reflect accounting for the discontinued operations of con edison communications 
for additional information about major factors affecting earnings  see results of operations summary  above 
in general  the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers see recoverable energy costs in note a and regulatory matters in note b to the financial statements 
accordingly  such costs do not generally affect the companies results of operations 
management uses the term net revenues operating revenues less such costs to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the companies results of operations 
management believes that  although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the companies results of operations
