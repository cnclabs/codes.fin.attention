item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended october   october  and november  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers  and manufacturers of fpds 
further  photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized ics  a reduction in design complexity or other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
further  advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry had been in a downturn from until the end of  which had a significant impact on the net sales and operating results of a majority of those companies in the industry 
end markets leading the global semiconductor industry out of the downturn in have been closely tied to consumer driven applications for high performance semiconductor devices  including  but not limited to communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
as of december  state of the art for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer and generation generation process technology  while nanometer is being moved into volume production 
and nanometer and generation through generation process technology for fpds constitute the majority of high performance designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects there to be an increase in nanometer designs moving to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing process and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
in and  the company has experienced growth in demand for fpd photomasks  which it currently supplies from its existing facility in korea 
the company is in the advanced stages of construction on two new photomask facilities  one in taichung  taiwan  and one in shanghai  china 
the company s new facility in taiwan will be able to serve the demand for large mask solutions to support taiwan s expanding fpd fabrication industry 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
through fiscal  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
through fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies  due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices asps 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s cash payments for capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high end technology products was an aggregate of approximately million for the three fiscal years ended october   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive based upon the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consists of nine sites and two more under construction  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess and underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins 
currently  the vast majority of photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger 
in the fpd market  a majority of photomasks produced are to support generation to generation processes 
at these technologies  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
recently  a limited amount of semiconductor fabrication has begun utilizing nanometer and generation and generation processes 
the company is currently capable of producing a broad range of photomasks at still smaller geometries  and has begun accelerating its efforts to support the development and production of photomasks for both the nanometer and nanometer technology nodes in semiconductors and generation in fpd 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its four advanced technology locations worldwide 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  october  november  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges operating income loss interest expense investment and other income  net income loss before income tax provision and minority interest income tax provision minority interest net income loss note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended october   october  and november   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to total net sales net sales for fiscal year increased to million as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in sales primarily relates to increased sales of fpd photomasks as a result of increased consumer demand for fpd applications  and to a lesser extent  an improved mix of sales of high end ic photomasks driven by increased design releases in for devices using advanced semiconductor applications 
during  the company s high end sales mix  which is defined as sales of photomask sets for semiconductor design releases at or below nanometer and for fpd sets utilizing generation and above technologies  improved to approximately of sales  from approximately of sales in as a result  the company s asps improved during as high end photomasks typically have higher asps 
while the company did experience increased unit demand for high end photomasks in  overall unit demand declined as a result of reduced units for mainstream ic photomasks  which are defined as nanometer and above 
by geographic area  net sales in asia increased million or  europe increased million or  and north america decreased million or 
net sales for fiscal year increased to million as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily related to increased design releases in as a result of improved end user demand  consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductor applications 
as a result  the company experienced increased unit demand across all technology nodes during to a lesser extent  the company s overall asps improved in the increased asps primarily relate to an improved high end mix  which was defined as revenue at nanometer and below design rules  and increased sales of large area masks which typically have higher asps 
by geographic area  sales increased by million in asia and million in europe  while sales in north america decreased by million 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin  which is net sales less cost of goods sold  was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the gross margin did not experience an increase in fiscal that would typically result from increased revenue as compared to the prior year period as a result of increased infrastructure costs associated with the expansion of the company s manufacturing base  primarily related to additional costs of equipment and production capability in asia 
gross margin was also negatively impacted during by reduced unit volumes  primarily mainstream ic photomasks 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and to the extent that the company s revenues and capacity utilization increases or decreases  gross margin will be positively or negatively impacted 
the company s gross margin could be negatively impacted in the future as the company increases its fixed cost manufacturing base  principally in asia 
during  the company s gross margin improved to  as compared to in fiscal this improvement was a result of improved utilization of the company s manufacturing network and improved high end product mix as well as stabilization of pricing for mainstream products 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses increased modestly or in during  the company experienced increased costs associated with the company s expansion in asia  primarily related to the company s taiwan fpd and china facilities and sarbanes oxley compliance 
these costs were somewhat mitigated by reduced salaries and wages in the united states and europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal year as compared to by million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the full year impact of reduced salaries and wages and selling expenses in north america associated with the company s north american consolidation initiatives coupled with ongoing cost reduction activities 
research and development percent change to to r d expense to net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions at and below nanometers for ic photomasks and next generation fpd technologies 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to continued expenditures relating to high end process technologies 
in fiscal  research and development expenditures were million as compared to million in consolidation  restructuring and related charges in march  the company initiated a plan to close its phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and further consolidate its north american manufacturing network in order to increase capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded during the second quarter of fiscal components of the charge include million for workforce reduction of approximately employees in the united states  million for facility lease payments  and million of non cash charges for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets 
the majority of the photomasks produced at the company s phoenix  arizona facility were cross qualified with other united states manufacturing sites 
consequently  the decision to close the phoenix  arizona facility had minimal impact on united states production or customer service 
in august  the company implemented a plan to reduce its operating cost structure by reducing its workforce in the united states by approximately employees and by ceasing the manufacture of photomasks at its milpitas  california facility 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the total charge  million was non cash for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets  million of cash charges for severance and benefits for terminated employees that were paid during their entitlement periods and million of cash charges for facilities closing costs as well as lease termination costs 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
this ongoing assessment could result  in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated by market conditions and customer requirements 
the following tables in millions set forth the company s restructuring reserves as of october   october  and november  and reflects the activities affecting the reserves for the years ended year ended october  october  october  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended october  november  october  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended november  november  november  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total as of october   manufacturing capacity reduction and other of million primarily represents non cancelable lease obligations that will be paid over the respective lease terms through other income expense interest expense investment and other income  net total other expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily a result of reduced year over year average outstanding debt 
investments and other income  net  increased million as a result of increased investment income associated with the company s million net stock offering proceeds received in july  increased grant income and foreign currency gains 
interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in interest expense is a result of reduced debt associated with the company s redemption of million of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes in june and the aggregate redemption of million during of the convertible subordinated notes 
investment and other income  net  decreased by million in primarily due to reduced investment gains 
income taxes the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax treatments 
the company is accorded a tax holiday in taiwan which will expire in december the company s tax holiday in singapore expired in june in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million or of pretax income  which differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of tax holidays in taiwan and singapore  available tax credits in korea and valuation reserves on tax losses generated in the united states 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million on a pre tax income of million 
similarly  the provision differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of taiwan s and singapore s tax holidays  available tax credits in korea  and valuation reserves on losses generated in the united states 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
the valuation allowance increased by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not have a significant impact in the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for united states multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside of the united states 
at an effective rate of 
the company has evaluated the effects of the repatriation provision and has elected not to avail itself to the ajca repatriation incentives 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest expense  which represents the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea  was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in minority interest expense is due to the increased ownership of the company s subsidiary in korea  which is offset in part by increased earnings of these subsidiaries in the company s ownership in its subsidiary in korea was on october  and at october  the company s ownership in its subsidiary in taiwan was at october  and october   respectively 
during  the company increased its ownership in its subsidiary in korea from to at october  for cash of approximately million 
in november  the company increased its ownership in its subsidiary in korea to for cash of approximately million 
the million increase for over is a result of increased earnings of both locations in in december  the company increased its ownership to approximately in its subsidiary in korea with the acquisition of additional shares for cash of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year ended in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities in july of  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
net of underwriting fees and other offering costs  the company s net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
the company s working capital increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at october  as compared to million at october  the increase in was primarily the result of net proceeds of million from its public stock offering and cash provided primarily by operations  less the redemption of million principle of its convertible subordinated notes  million additional investment in pkl  and capital expenditures of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal primarily due to increased net income generated in fiscal for the fiscal year ended october  cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase relates to the net income generated in as compared to a net loss in cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in  as a result of the million additional investment in pkl and capital expenditures of million 
in fiscal cash used in investing activities was million  which consisted principally of capital equipment purchases of million and a net increase in short term investments of million 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million to million 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be used primarily to continue to expand the company s high end ic and fpd technical capability 
in november  the company invested an additional million in pkl 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million which consists of million net proceeds from the company s public stock offering  less the million redemption of the company s subordinated notes and repayment of million of other borrowings 
the company believes that its currently available resources  together with its capacity for growth and its accessibility to debt and equity financing sources  are sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company intends to repay the million convertible subordinated notes due december with its currently available cash and cash generated from fiscal operations 
the company s commitments represent investments in additional manufacturing capacity as well as advanced equipment for the production of high end  more complex photomasks 
at october   the company had commitments outstanding for capital expenditures of approximately million 
additional commitments for capital requirements are expected to be incurred during fiscal cash requirements the company s cash requirements over the next months will be primarily to fund operations  including spending on research and development  capital expenditures and debt service  as well as any cash acquisitions that it may undertake 
in addition  its convertible subordinated notes  of which million was outstanding at october   are due on december  the company expects that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash and short term investments 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of october  in millions payments due total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total certain transactions the chairman of the board of the company is also the chairman of the board and majority shareholder of a company who is a supplier of secure managed information technology services

the company purchased million  million  and million of photomask blanks from this company in   and  respectively  for which the amount owed to this company was million at october   million at october  and million at november   respectively 
the company believes that the terms of the transactions described above with affiliated persons were negotiated at arm s length and were no less favorable to the company than the company could have obtained from non affiliated parties 
during fiscal year  the company initiated a plan to acquire all of the outstanding shares of its non wholly owned subsidiary in korea 
as part of the purchase of outstanding shares  the company acquired  shares or from employees  including officers  of pkl for  won per share or us dollars per share 
two of these employees are also officers of the company 
the total purchase price of million from pkl employees represents a premium of approximately per share above similar purchases of stock from other stockholders during the same time period 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet net of related debt  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must meet certain criteria and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in such areas as projected interest rates and bond prices which are affected by changes in the company s stock price during the contract term 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
actual fair values may differ from estimated fair values 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  and software development costs 
these assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of five years for software development costs 
the future economic benefit of the carrying value of all intangible assets is reviewed annually and the company uses judgment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined see note 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required if realization is not likely by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company makes estimates and assumptions and uses judgment relating to discounts and estimates for product return and warranties  which are accrued and recognized at the time of sale 
discounts sales discounts are negotiated with customers prior to billing and at the time of billing  sales invoices are prepared net of negotiated sales discounts 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specification 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of shipment  a liability is established for these items 
customer acceptance customer acceptance occurs concurrently with the transfer of title and risk of loss based upon the applicable shipping and delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to use considerable judgment in estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events  and historical experience

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
contract payments are made on a libor based variable rate at october  and are received at the fixed rate 
the interest rate swap contract is used to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates 
this contract is considered to be a hedge against interest rate risk of the company s fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the contract has been reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
in addition  changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the contract  as well as offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the net effect of this accounting on the company s operations results is that the interest expense portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on variable rates 
at this time  the company does not have plans to enter into additional interest rate swap contracts  however  at a future point the company may decide to do so 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the principal functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar and singapore dollar 
the principal functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound and euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk to foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital 
in some instances  the company may sell products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced 
to date  the company has not experienced a significant foreign exchange loss on these sales 
however  there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of october  included the korean won  singapore dollar  the new taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound 
as of october   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the us dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of other non us dollar currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings are in the form of its convertible subordinated notes  which bear interest at rates of and and certain foreign secured and unsecured notes payable which bear interest at rates between and 
in addition  the interest rate swap contract discussed above subjects the company to market risk as interest rates fluctuate and impacts the interest payments due on the million notional amount of the contract 
at october   the company had approximately million in net variable rate financial instruments which were sensitive to interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
