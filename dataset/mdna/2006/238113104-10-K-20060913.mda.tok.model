item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview datascope corp 
is a diversified medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets proprietary products for clinical health care markets in interventional cardiology and radiology  cardiovascular and vascular surgery  anesthesiology  emergency medicine and critical care 
we have four product lines that are aggregated into two reportable segments  cardiac assist monitoring products and interventional products vascular grafts 
we have aggregated our product lines into two segments based on similar manufacturing processes  distribution channels  regulatory environments and customers 
management evaluates the revenue and profitability performance of each of our product lines to make operating and strategic decisions 
the cardiac assist monitoring products segment accounts for of total sales 
our products are sold worldwide by direct sales representatives and independent distributors 
our largest geographic markets are the united states  europe and japan 
we believe that customers  primarily hospitals and other medical institutions  choose among competing products on the basis of product performance  features  price and service 
in general  we believe price has become an important factor in hospital purchasing decisions because of pressure to cut costs 
these pressures on hospitals result from federal and state regulations that limit reimbursement for services provided to medicare and medicaid patients 
there are also cost containment pressures on healthcare systems outside the united states  particularly in certain european countries 
many companies  some of which are substantially larger than us  are engaged in manufacturing competing products 
our products are generally not affected by economic cycles 
our sales growth depends in part upon the successful development and marketing of new products 
we have continued to increase our investment in research and development r d 
in fiscal we spent million on r d  an increase of million or from fiscal our growth strategy includes selective acquisitions of products and technologies from other companies 
during the past two years we have made investments in several new technologies  including the x site vascular closure device x site and the clearglide endoscopic vessel harvesting evh product 
we are committed to improving our operating margins through increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and cost containment programs 
in january  we acquired assets and technology related to ethicon s clearglide endoscopic vessel harvesting product line 
ethicon is a johnson johnson company 
endoscopic vessel harvesting devices enable less invasive techniques for the harvesting of suitable vessels for use in conjunction with coronary artery bypass grafting 
the vessel harvesting product line was integrated into the cardiac assist business  which markets its products to cardiac surgeons who perform coronary bypass graft surgery 
datascope s financial position continued strong at the end of fiscal  with cash and marketable investments at million compared to million at june  results of operations financial summary the following table shows the comparison of net earnings and earnings per diluted share over the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except per share data year ended june  net earnings earnings per share  diluted the increase in net earnings and earnings per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused principally by higher earnings in the cardiac assist and intervascular businesses  dividend income received of million after tax  or per share from a preferred stock investment  and a gain on sale of an unused facility of million after tax  or per share 
additionally  fiscal included special 
back to contents charges of million after tax or per share as discussed below 
partially offsetting the above was lower earnings in the interventional products and patient monitoring businesses and a charge of million after tax  or per share  related to the postponement of the launch of the x site vascular closure device 
the decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused principally by special charges of million after tax or per share  related to a million write off of tangible and intangible assets  a million write off of investments in two medical technology companies and million in severance expenses 
in addition  there was a one time income tax expense of million or per share related to repatriation of approximately million of foreign earnings 
also contributing to the lower earnings was the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices from fiscal to fiscal and lower earnings of the patient monitoring business 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales sales the following table shows sales by product line over the past three fiscal years 
sales by product line dollars in millions year ended june  cardiac assist monitoring products segment patient monitoring change from prior year of total sales cardiac assist change from prior year of total sales interventional products vascular grafts segment interventional products change from prior year of total sales vascular grafts change from prior year of total sales corporate and other genisphere change from prior year of total sales total sales change from prior year sales in fiscal of million increased million or compared to million in fiscal unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced sales growth by million as a result of the stronger united states us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound  the currencies in countries in which we have direct sales subsidiaries 
sales in the us of million  increased million or attributable to increased sales in cardiac assist and patient monitoring 
sales in international markets of million increased million or excluding unfavorable foreign exchange translation of million due to increases in all businesses  except intervascular 
sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 

back to contents patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products increased to million due primarily to increased sales of panorama patient monitoring networks 
panorama was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  and worldwide installations have grown to more than at the end of fiscal partially offsetting the above were lower average selling prices for bedside monitors in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting increased competitive pressure in the united states and in certain international markets and unfavorable foreign exchange translation which reduced sales growth by million 
cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products increased to million due to higher shipments of both balloon pumps and intra aortic balloons  plus million of sales of the newly acquired evh product 
unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced sales growth by million 
sales of balloon pumps  principally the cs automatic balloon pump  reflect continued strong international demand and the replacement of older pump models from the large base of installed pumps in the united states 
sales of intra aortic balloons increased due to continued strong international growth 
sales of intra aortic balloons in the united states remained steady with a slight decrease in unit sales being offset by higher average selling prices as a result of increased sales of the higher priced linear fr 
balloon 
the clearglide evh product was launched by the cardiac assist division in january  after completion of the acquisition from ethicon  a johnson johnson company 
we estimate that currently approximately of the  coronary bypass procedures now performed in the united states use evh products 
accordingly  we estimate that the total potential annual market for evh is approximately million at full penetration and we expect the clearglide product to make a significant contribution to the future growth of the cardiac assist business 
sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million last year 
interventional products sales of interventional products decreased million or to million in fiscal  as sales of vasoseal  our principal vascular closure device  continued to decrease due to competitive pressure 
the vasoseal decline of was partially offset by sales of non closure products  including safeguard our manual compression assist device  which grew over last year  and on site  our new collagen based vascular closure device  which was launched in march the market response to on site continues to be encouraging 
although much of the initial sales effort was devoted to vasoseal accounts in order to improve the base business  sales of on site to non vasoseal accounts contributed to total on site sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we postponed the launch of the x site vascular closure device in the us the delay was the result of market feedback from the limited launch of x site  which revealed a strong market preference for a pre tied knot as an integral part of the device 
the x site product currently provides a suture knot tier as an accessory 
we expect to receive the ce mark for our retooled x site suture based closure device in time to launch in the european market in the third quarter of fiscal we estimate that the timing of fda regulatory approval  which lags ce mark approval  could allow for a us launch of the new x site in the fourth quarter of fiscal vascular grafts sales of intervascular products decreased to million in fiscal sales last year included a non recurring order from an international distributor and an initial stocking order in connection with the change in our us distribution strategy from a direct sales model to an exclusive distributor relationship with wl gore associates  inc  both occurring in the fourth quarter last year 
this change resulted in lower average us selling prices in fiscal international sales decreased due to the emergence of less invasive 
back to contents therapies stent grafts and competitive pricing pressure in the european markets 
unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced sales growth by million 
genisphere sales of genisphere products of million in fiscal were unchanged compared to fiscal  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy to develop products for use in newly developed protein and nucleic acid detection platforms 
costs and expenses gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit increased million or as a result of increased sales in the cardiac assist patient monitoring segment 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to last year  with the decrease of percentage points primarily due to a less favorable sales mix as a result of lower sales of higher margin vasoseal devices  increased sales of intra aortic balloon pumps  sales of graft products to gore  our exclusive us distributor  at lower average selling prices  and lower gross margin in patient monitoring primarily as a result of competitive pressure on prices 
in addition  fiscal included a charge of million related to the postponed market launch and redesign of the x site device see special items 
the x site charge was equivalent to percentage points of gross margin in fiscal research and development r d we continued our company wide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
total r d expense increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
r d expense for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year 
the increase was primarily due to expenses associated with increased new product development projects and reduced capitalization of software development costs for panorama as a new software release was launched in the third quarter last year 
r d expense for the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million last year 
the decrease was attributable to the termination of an r d project in the fourth quarter of fiscal r d expense in the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal included the x site special charge of million see special items 
the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal compared to million for the comparable period last year 
selling  general and administrative sg a total sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
selling expenses  which comprise selling  marketing and clinical support costs  decreased compared to last year 
contributing to that decline was the elimination of direct selling in the united states commencing in may  when we appointed gore the exclusive united states distributor of our lntervascular products  and the expense reduction achieved as a result of the workforce reductions at the interventional products division in the second fiscal quarter of this year 
general and administrative expense increased  due principally to higher legal costs  as certain of our legal proceedings approached trial  and in support of increased business development activities 
legal expenses are included in corporate and other 
sg a expense for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal the increase was attributable to increased headcount in direct selling  including the sales reps 
back to contents hired with the purchase of the evh business  higher selling and marketing expenses associated with increased sales and unfavorable foreign exchange translation 
sg a expense for the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal decreased to million due to the elimination of the intervascular us sales organization as a result of our appointment of gore as exclusive us distributor for intervascular in the fourth quarter last year and the workforce reduction in the interventional products division in the second quarter of fiscal sg a expense in the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal included the x site special charge of million see special items 
segment sg a expense includes fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the stronger us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound decreased total sg a expense by approximately million in fiscal special items we have a preferred stock investment in masimo corporation  a supplier to the patient monitoring business 
in february  masimo s board of directors and stockholders approved a special dividend payment to all stockholders 
in march  we received million of that special dividend  with the balance of million to be collected at a later date 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge totaling million related to the postponed launch of the x site vascular closure device in the us the delay is the result of market feedback from the limited launch of x site  which revealed a strong market preference for a pre tied knot as an integral part of the device 
the x site product currently provides a suture knot tier as an accessory 
in december  we approved a plan to reduce operating expenses in conjunction with the decision to delay the launch of the x site device 
as a result  we eliminated positions  or of the workforce in the interventional products division at a cost of million for severance and other termination benefits 
all of the terminated employees left the company by the end of december and severance payments were completed by the end of fiscal in addition  as a result of our decision to redesign the x site device to incorporate a pre tied knot  we wrote off million of existing x site inventory and tooling and recorded a liability of million for purchase commitments and contract termination costs 
the special charge is reflected in the interventional products vascular grafts segment million cost of sales  million r d and million sg a 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain of million related to the sale of an unused facility in vaals  the netherlands  that was closed as part of a restructuring program at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
these charges consisted of the termination of certain r d projects totaling million  a write off of investments in two private medical technology companies of million and severance expenses of million for workforce reductions related to a company wide cost reduction program 
interest income interest income of million in fiscal was unchanged from last year 
an increase in the average interest rate yield to from  was offset by a lower average portfolio balance million vs 
million 
dividend income see special items above 

back to contents other  net other  net increased million to million for fiscal compared to million last year  primarily attributable to realized losses of million on the sale of marketable securities that were liquidated as part of our repatriation of foreign earnings of million 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to the tax on repatriation of foreign earnings last year and the lower effective tax rate on the million special dividend income from masimo in fiscal due to the federal dividends received deduction 
the above items were partially offset by a reduced benefit for the federal research credit  due to its expiration on december   and an incremental phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal  with the increased earnings in fiscal  due to the factors discussed above in the financial summary section 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales in fiscal of million increased million or compared to million in fiscal sales increased in all product lines except interventional products 
favorable foreign exchange translation contributed million to the sales increase as a result of the weakness of the united states us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound  the currencies in countries in which we have direct sales subsidiaries 
sales in the us of million  decreased million or attributable to the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices and lower sales of patient monitoring products 
sales in international markets of million increased million or excluding favorable foreign exchange translation of million due to increases in all businesses  except interventional products 
sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products in fiscal increased to million due primarily to increased sales in international markets and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
a delay in shipping panorama patient monitoring networks in the fourth quarter resulted in slightly lower us sales for the year 
in the fourth quarter  the number of panorama orders requiring delivery in future quarters was greater than expected 
also  a hiatus in installations during the fourth quarter of fiscal to resolve product issues increased the backlog of installations and temporarily moved commitments to start installations from days to days  delaying certain shipments accordingly 
the product issues were resolved in early june cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products increased to million due to continued strong worldwide unit sales of our cs balloon pump  continued higher unit sales of intra aortic balloons in international markets and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales in the us of million increased million or  and sales in international markets of million increased million or excluding foreign exchange translation 

back to contents in january  we broadened and strengthened the intra aortic balloon product line when we introduced the linear fr 
intra aortic balloon iab 
the linear fr 
has the smallest diameter of any iab catheter 
reducing iab diameter is highly desirable because it allows more blood flow around the catheter thereby enabling clinicians to deliver counterpulsation therapy even to patients with smaller peripheral arteries 
the linear also features a new balloon membrane that is the most abrasion resistant of any iab 
sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million in fiscal interventional products sales of interventional products were million  below the prior year as sales of vasoseal  vascular sealing devices  decreased to million  partially offset by increased sales of new interventional products  safeguard and prolumen 
we had expected to turn around the sales performance of interventional products by introducing two new vascular closure devices x site and on site  and by the growing contributions of new interventional products that now include the safeguard hemostasis management device  the prolumen thrombectomy device and the proguide chronic dialysis catheter 
those innovative products which have already been introduced or are scheduled for introduction in the first half of fiscal will  if successful  lead to improved margins and earnings in the second half of fiscal as described below  the x site device did not launch in fiscal x site is a vascular closure device aimed at an estimated million suture based market segment for closing the arterial wound after a catheterization procedure 
x site has fda approval and is currently in use at beta sites 
we believe that the testing at beta sites is demonstrating that x site has advantages over the competitive device 
a limited market launch was planned for september  followed by a full launch in october that launch is now planned for the third quarter of fiscal to the european market after receipt of ce approval and in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the united states market after receipt of fda approval 
on site is a collagen based vascular closure device aimed at first stabilizing and then growing sales to existing vasoseal accounts 
on site retains the extravascular advantage of vasoseal but eliminates the need for a second operator and provides for wire guided delivery of the collagen plug to seal the arterial wound 
on site received fda approval in late may market launch is planned for early calendar the proguide chronic dialysis catheter  launched in may  is the latest of four new interventional products introduced over the past years 
proguide enters a worldwide market estimated at million annually 
chronic dialysis catheters connect a patient with end stage renal disease to a dialysis machine and allow for needle free access for the dialysis procedure 
by using a guide wire and eliminating the peel away sheath required by competitive catheters  the proguide provides easier insertion and makes the procedure more convenient according to early users 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc s products were million  above the prior year  as a result of higher sales in the us following the appointment of gore as intervascular s exclusive us distributor effective may   increased shipments to japan and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales to gore in the fourth quarter included million for an initial stocking order 
sales in the us increased million or and sales in international markets increased million or excluding foreign exchange translation 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 

back to contents costs and expenses gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit increased million or as a result of increased sales in all businesses except interventional products 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal  with the decrease of percentage points primarily due to a less favorable sales mix  as a result of reduced sales of higher margin interventional products and inventory write offs for excess and obsolete inventories  primarily in the interventional products and patient monitoring divisions 
research and development r d we continued our company wide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
total r d expense increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales in fiscal r d expense for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products including the linear fr  intra aortic balloon in cardiac assist  and the panorama  patient monitoring network in patient monitoring  as well as new product development projects 
r d expense for the interventional products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products such as the safeguard and proguide and new product development projects  including the x site and on site vascular closure devices

the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased total sg a expense by approximately million in fiscal special items in fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
these charges related to the following termination of certain r d projects totaling million 
based upon recently completed extensive reviews of the current and future market  clinical benefits  cost to manufacture  price realization and the development and regulatory costs required for a successful market launch  certain r d projects were terminated 
as a result of the decision to terminate the projects we wrote off licenses and purchased technology of million and tooling and other assets of million 
the licenses  purchased technology and tooling were determined to be fully impaired at june  because 
back to contents they have no alternative future use 
contractual obligations for non cancelable purchase orders and settlement costs related to the r d projects of million were also recorded 
write off of investments in two private medical technology companies of million 
in conjunction with the decision to terminate certain r d projects as noted above  we recorded an impairment of our investment in the common and preferred stock of the private medical technology company  totaling million 
the investment in the common stock of this company was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment and adjusted the carrying value of the investment to zero 
we recorded an impairment of million for an investment in the preferred stock of a second private medical technology company based on information received from that company that the performance of their lead product in clinical trials was significantly below target and affected their ability to raise funds 
we determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment and adjusted the carrying value of the investment to zero 
severance expenses of million for workforce reductions related to a company wide cost reduction program 
as a result of a company wide cost reduction program that was approved by management  we recorded severance expenses of million for the termination of employees of the workforce 
the reductions were in manufacturing  r d and sg a 
thirteen of the headcount reductions were achieved through attrition 
substantially all of the terminated employees left the company by june  the severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year the special charges are reflected in the following segments interventional products vascular grafts million corporate and other million interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  with the increase due primarily to an increase in the average interest rate yield to from  partially offset by a lower average portfolio balance million vs 
million 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at lower effective rates  reduced earnings in the us and a greater benefit for the federal research credit  partially offset by a one time additional tax expense of million for repatriation of foreign earnings 
on october   the working families tax relief act of wftra was enacted 
the wftra includes a july  retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit  which is now scheduled to expire on december  on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
under ajca  the extraterritorial income exclusion eie is being phased out over a two year period 
our effective tax rate for fiscal includes the net benefit of the reinstatement of the research credit and the initial phase out of the eie 
the ajca also provides a temporary dividends received deduction for certain cash dividends repatriated from our international operations 
the amount of dividends eligible for repatriation is subject to several limitations  and requires that the proceeds be invested in the us pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repatriation of million of foreign earnings and a tax provision of approximately million related to the repatriation was recorded 

back to contents net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal net earnings in fiscal included special charges of million after tax or per diluted share and a one time income tax expense of million or per diluted share related to repatriation of foreign earnings 
net earnings were below fiscal  principally due to the items noted above  the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices and lower earnings in the patient monitoring division  as a result of the panorama shipment delay in the fourth quarter 
stock based compensation we awarded fully vested  nonqualified stock options to eligible employees as part of our annual stock option award  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the immediate vesting provisions  this one time award resulted in increased pro forma compensation expense for the fiscal year ended june  on may   the board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all stock options outstanding under our amended and restated stock option plan that had exercise prices per share higher than  the average of the high and low sales price of our stock on may  options to purchase approximately thousand shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately  subject to an exercise price threshold requirement 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting of existing stock option grants and the immediate vesting provision of the fiscal year stock option grant was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statement of earnings with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and requires that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of earnings  rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our historical financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal vs 
fiscal we consider our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and our available unsecured lines of credit to be our principal sources of liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at june  were million compared to million at june  long term investments were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
working capital increased to million compared to million at the end of fiscal and the current ratio increased to from last year 
the increase in working capital and the current ratio was primarily due to an increase in short term investments million  accounts receivable million and inventories million  and a decrease in current liabilities million 
the increase in short term investments was primarily due to investing cash generated from operations 
the increase in accounts receivable of million reflected the increase in sales 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to build up for new products and planned safety stock in cardiac assist 
the decrease in current liabilities was primarily attributable to the repayment of the million of short term debt 
in fiscal  we provided million of net cash from operating activities compared to million last year with the decrease primarily attributable to a reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets which consumed million more cash in fiscal than in the prior year due principally to an increase in pension contributions and prepaid taxes 

back to contents we used a net million of cash in investing activities 
net sales and maturities of investments yielded million and proceeds from the sale of assets added million of cash 
these million of proceeds were spent on million of investment purchases  million of capital and technology and million of capitalized software 
we used a net million of cash in financing activities 
we paid million in dividends  comprising four quarterly dividends of per share and a special dividend of per share declared in the second fiscal quarter and paid in the third fiscal quarter 
we also repaid million of short term borrowings 
financing cash outlays were partially funded by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million of excess tax benefits to be realized from stock based awards 
we purchased about  shares of our common stock for approximately thousand during fiscal year subsequent events 
on september   the board of directors of the company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share and a special dividend of per share  both payable on october  to stockholders of record as of september  in addition  the board approved a stock repurchase program for million of our common stock 
purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  and may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the company 
fiscal vs 
fiscal working capital at june  of million compared to million at june  and the current ratio was compared to at june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and short term investments million  accounts receivable million and prepaid expenses and other current assets million 
partially offsetting the above was a decrease in prepaid income taxes million and an increase in current liabilities million 
the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to classifying million of marketable investments held in europe as short term because they will be repatriated to the united states under the approved tax repatriation program in fiscal the increase in accounts receivable of million primarily reflected the increase in sales 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in other receivables 
the decrease in prepaid income taxes of million resulted from receipt of a tax refund 
the increase in current liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in short term debt of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million last year with the decrease primarily attributable to lower earnings and an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to sale of investments of million and million for maturities of investments  partially offset by purchases of investments of million  million for capitalized software  the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment and million for purchased technology and licenses  primarily for a license for the rights to manufacture our anestar anesthesia delivery systems 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid  stock repurchases of million and repayments of short term borrowings of million  partially offset by stock option activity of million and short term borrowings of million 
we purchased about  shares of our common stock for approximately million during fiscal year we believe that our existing cash and investment balances  future cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital  capital and investment needs 
the moderate rate of current united states inflation has not significantly affected the company 

back to contents presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commitments as of june  dollars in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments guaranteed milestone payments total contractual obligations and other commitments these amounts include non cancelable purchase commitments for inventory and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
represents guaranteed milestone payments under the x site purchase agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements at june  we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
information concerning forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the risk that the clearglide evh product will not make a significant contribution to the future growth of the cardiac assist business  that the early response to the on site product will not continue  that the introduction of x site will be delayed and market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the markets served by the company 
additional risks are our dependence on certain unaffiliated suppliers including single source manufacturers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and interventional products  continued demand for our products generally  rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in item a of this report and documents filed by datascope with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and adjust as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on current and historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue and all related costs  including warranty costs  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss passes to the customer and collectibility of the fixed sales price is probable 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when they leave our premises 
for products shipped fob destination  revenue is recognized when they reach the customer 
for certain products where we maintain consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized when the product has been used by the customer 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
historical experience 
back to contents is used to estimate an accrual for future returns relating to recorded sales  as well as estimated warranty costs 
revenue for service repairs of equipment is recognized after service has been completed  and service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
for certain products  revenue is recognized separately for delivered components when the delivered components have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered components and the undelivered components are not essential to the functionality of the delivered components 
we do not have a general right of return for our products 
post shipment obligations for training commitments are considered perfunctory  and sales are recognized when delivered with provision for incremental costs 
we reflect shipping and handling fees as revenue and shipping and handling costs as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to report trade receivables at their estimated net realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate cash which ultimately will be collected from the gross receivables balance at period end 
such amount cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables  determined based on historical trends 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory is recorded at its estimated fair market value based upon our historical experience with inventory becoming obsolete due to age  changes in technology and other factors 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess whether it will be more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and or the implementation of tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that recovery is likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we have not recorded us deferred income taxes on certain of our us subsidiaries undistributed earnings  because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
our repatriation of million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of was deemed to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had previously been treated as indefinitely reinvested 
however  this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
our us income tax returns for fiscal and prior years have been audited by the internal revenue service and are closed 
the us statutory period has expired for fiscal years though  and is open for subsequent periods 
during fiscal  we have closed audits in several foreign jurisdictions with immaterial adjustments 
statutory periods remain open in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws and the status of current examinations 
although we have recorded all probable income tax accruals in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 
back to contents no 
 accounting for contingencies and sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our accruals represent accounting estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process  and therefore include certain contingencies 
we believe that our accrual for income tax liabilities  including related interest  is adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
pension plan actuarial assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements 
we use several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense and liability related to our pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates are utilized 
the actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences  depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we record in any particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp provides an elective alternative transition method that consists of a computation that creates an additional paid in capital apic pool related to previously recognized tax benefits on equity based employee compensation  and a simplified method to determine how awards that are fully vested and outstanding when statement r is adopted will subsequently affect the apic pool 
the guidance in this fsp is effective after november  entities may make a one time election to apply the transition method discussed in this fsp 
that one time election may be made within one year of an entity s adoption of statement r  or the fsp s effective date  whichever is later 
we adopted the alternative transition method at june  and determined that we have an apic pool under fsp r in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions which utilizes a two step approach for evaluating such tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two is only addressed if step one has been satisfied 
in addition  expanded disclosures are required 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year beginning july  
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
none of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as economic hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  no foreign currency transaction gains or losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended june   and 
back to contents as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed
