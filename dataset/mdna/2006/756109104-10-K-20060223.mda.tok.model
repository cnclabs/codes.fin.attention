item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  or reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo per share 
the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  retail and real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements primarily to years 
in addition  we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  retail properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied of the  properties in the portfolio  leased to different retail chains doing business in separate retail industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable retail space per property of  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant  retail properties and the remaining five are multi tenant  distribution and office properties 
at december    or  of the  single tenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition  our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  crest net lease  inc  owned properties with a total investment of million at december   which are classified as held for sale 
crest net was created to buy  own and sell properties  primarily to individual investors  many of whom are involved in tax deferred exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 
million credit facility we have a million revolving  unsecured credit facility that expires in october realty income s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
at february   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of million at an effective interest rate of 
the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
mortgage debt we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
universal shelf registration of million in february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering the issuance  from time to time  of up to million in aggregate value of common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
at february   million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration statement 
issuance of common stock in in september  realty income issued million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds of approximately from this offering were used to fund new property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
issuance of year senior unsecured notes in september  realty income issued million in aggregate principal amount of year  senior unsecured notes due the price to the public for the notes was of the principal amount for an effective yield of 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the company s unsecured acquisition credit facility  for property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
issuance of year senior unsecured bonds in march  realty income issued million in aggregate principal amount of year  senior unsecured bonds due the price to the investor for the bonds was of the principal amount for an effective yield of 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at february   our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were million or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
we calculate our total market capitalization at february  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share  or billion  aggregate liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of million  outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility  and outstanding notes of million 
historically  we have met our long term capital needs through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock  however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 
credit agency ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings  on our senior unsecured notes  from fitch ratings  moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s ratings group 
currently  fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
moody s rating has a positive outlook and the other ratings have a stable outlook 
we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock 
moody s rating has a positive outlook and the other ratings have a stable outlook 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
notes outstanding in september  we issued million of  year  senior unsecured notes due interest on these notes is paid semiannually

all of these notes contain various covenants  including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than times  and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than of our outstanding unsecured debt 
we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued 
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes 
the actual amounts are as of december  note covenants required actual limitation on incurrence of total debt limitation on incurrence of secured debt debt service coverage x x maintenance of total unencumbered assets of unsecured debt all of our outstanding notes have fixed interest rates 
our credit facility interest rate is variable

other consists of million of estimated unfunded costs on properties under development and  of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured 
accordingly  we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 
preferred stock outstanding in may and october  we issued an aggregate of million shares of class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
beginning may   shares of class d preferred stock are redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class d preferred are paid monthly in arrears 
no off balance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investment realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off balance sheet investments in variable interest entities or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments

of the million realty income invested in real estate during  million was invested in properties under development with rent scheduled to begin at various times during at december   we also had committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling million 
the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property this is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under development  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total costs 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
investments in existing properties in  we capitalized costs of million on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of  for re leasing costs and million for building improvements 
sales of investment properties during  we sold properties and sold a portion of land from two properties for an aggregate of million  which resulted in a gain on sales of million 
this gain is included in discontinued operations  except for  that is included in other revenue 
the properties sold consisted of one automotive service store  two automotive tire service locations  seven child care facilities  two consumer electronics stores  one convenience store  one motor vehicle dealership  one private education facility  seven restaurants  and one property classified as other 
the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 
crest net property sales during  crest net  our wholly owned subsidiary  sold properties from its inventory for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
crest net s property inventory crest net s property inventory totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  crest net s properties are included in real estate held for sale  net  on our consolidated balance sheets

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders we continue our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per share were increased in april by to  in july by to  in september by to  in october by to and in january by 
to 
the increase in january was our rd consecutive quarterly increase and the th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in in  we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of  three in the amount of  two in the amount of  one in the amount of  and three in the amount of totaling 
in december  january and february  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid on january  and february  and will be paid on march   respectively 
the monthly distribution of per share represents a current annualized distribution of per share  and an annualized distribution yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of on february  although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share  or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
no depreciation has been recorded on crest net s properties because they are held for sale 
another significant judgment that must be made is  if and when the impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
generally  a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or 
rental revenue was million in the increase in rental revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated million in  the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated million in compared to million in  an increase of million  same store rents generated on  properties during and increased by million  or  to million from million 
these properties were leased during all of both and an increase in straight line rent and other non cash adjustments to rent of million in as compared to  and an increase of  relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before that started paying rent in  ii properties that were vacant during part of or and iii lease termination settlements 
these items in aggregate totaled million in and million in realty income acquired retail properties in  excluding crest net acquisitions  and as a result  our operating results included less than a full year of rental revenue from these properties 
accordingly  we anticipate that the contribution to rental revenue from these properties will increase in  because there will be a full year of rent from these properties 
our portfolio of retail real estate  leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases  continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  retail properties was leased with properties available for lease  one of which is a multi tenant property 
of the  properties in the portfolio at december    or  are single tenant properties and the remaining properties are multi tenant  distribution and office properties 
of the  single tenant properties   or  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately years at december  of our  leased single tenant and certain other properties   or  were under leases that provide for increases in rents through base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings  fixed increases  to a lesser degree  overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales  or a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 
percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was million in  million in and million in percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in as of february   transactions to lease or sell of the properties available for lease at december  were underway or completed 
we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months  although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period 
it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
interest expense interest expense was million higher in than in primarily due to higher average outstanding balances 
interest expense was million in the following is a summary of the five components of our interest expense dollars in thousands interest on our credit facility and notes interest included in discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by crest amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements credit facility commitment fees amortization of credit facility origination costs and deferred bond financing costs interest capitalized interest expense credit facilities and notes outstanding average outstanding balances in thousands average interest rates interest on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by million in as compared to primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances in at february  the weighted average interest rate on our credit facility borrowings of million was  notes payable of million was  and combined outstanding credit facility and notes of million was 
interest coverage ratio our interest coverage ratio for was times  for was times and for was times 
interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense  including interest recorded to discontinued operations 
we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company s ability to meet its interest expense obligations 
our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio  except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator 
we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments 
our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in and million in the increases in depreciation and amortization in and are due to the acquisition of properties in  and  which was partially offset by property sales in these years 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in versus million in general and administrative expenses were million in in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to as compared to in and in general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs of corporate insurance  payroll  employee benefits  corporate governance and sarbanes oxley act of compliance costs 
as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow  we have increased  and anticipate that we will continue to increase  the level of our staffing 
we expect general and administrative expenses to moderately increase due to costs attributable to payroll  staffing costs and corporate governance 
at february   we had permanent employees and four temporary employees as compared to february  when we had permanent employees and six temporary employees 
the temporary employees have been working on a record retention project that is expected to conclude in property expenses property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non net leased multi tenant properties  unleased single tenant properties and general portfolio expenses 
expenses related to the multi tenant and unleased single tenant properties include  but are not limited to  property taxes  maintenance  insurance  utilities  property inspections  bad debt expense and legal fees 
general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  and at december  property expenses were million in  million in and million in the  increase in property expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties and bad debt expense 
income taxes income taxes were  in as compared to  in and  in these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income 
the increases in and are due to an increase in rental revenue causing higher city and state income tax expense 
in addition  crest net incurred state and federal income taxes of  in as compared to million in and million in the decrease in over the and amounts are due to lower taxable income  primarily attributable to lower gain on sales of real estate acquired for re sale 
these amounts are included in income from discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by crest 
discontinued operations crest net acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties 
consequently  we classify properties acquired by crest net as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them 
the operations of crest net s properties are classified as income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest 
the following is a summary of crest net s income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands crest net s income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale rental revenue interest expense general and administrative expense property expenses income taxes income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest per common share  basic and diluted realty income s operations from four properties listed as held for sale at december   plus properties sold in  and have been classified as discontinued operations

in  crest net sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
in  crest net sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
all gains on sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes 
at december   crest net had million invested in properties  which are held for sale 
our goal is for crest net to carry an average inventory of approximately to million in real estate 
crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties 
it is our belief that at this level of inventory  rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest net without any property sales 
gain on sales of investment properties by realty income included in discontinued operations in  we sold investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for million and recognized a gain on sales of million 
this gain is included in discontinued operations  except for  that is included in other revenue 
in  we sold or exchanged investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four properties for a total of million and recognized a gain of million 
this gain is included in discontinued operations  except for  that is included in other revenue 
in  we sold or exchanged properties and exchanged three excess land parcels from three properties for million and recognized a gain of million  which is included in discontinued operations 
we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term 
at december   we classified real estate with a carrying amount of million as held for sale  which includes million in properties owned by crest net 
in addition   invested by crest net in real estate is included in other assets and was classified as intangible assets 
additionally  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between million and million in proceeds during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months 
provisions for impairments provisions for impairments of  were recorded in on four properties as compared to million in on six properties and million on properties in these provisions are included in income from discontinued operations  real estate held for investment  except for  in  which is included in property expenses 
preferred stock cash dividends and redemption charge we had preferred stock cash dividends of million in as compared to million in and million in when we redeemed our class b preferred stock in june and our class c preferred stock in july  we incurred non cash charges of million and million  respectively  for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value 
these non cash charges represent the class b and class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed 
these non cash charges equated to per common share in net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders in decreased by  to million as compared to million in net income available to common stockholders in was million 
the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties 
the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 
the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during was million as compared to million during and million in the gain recognized from the sale of properties acquired for re sale during was million as compared to million during and million during funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders ffo for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure to ffo  information regarding cash distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for  and dollars in thousands net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment gain on sales of investment properties continuing operations discontinued operations total funds from operations ffo per common share  basic ffo per common share  diluted cash distributions paid to common stockholders ffo in excess of distributions to common stockholders basic weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  reduced by gains on sales of investment property and extraordinary items 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non cash items such as depreciation 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income s performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 
other non cash items and capitalized expenditures the following information includes non cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio 
these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo 
analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 
for the years ended dollars in thousands provisions for impairments amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements amortization of deferred note financing costs amortization of deferred stock compensation and stock option costs capitalized leasing costs and commissions capitalized building improvements straight line rent preferred stock origination costs write off the settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that was used by the company in and  which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities 
we have not employed this strategy since amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may  october  january  march  november  march and september these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
a negative amount indicates that our straight line rent was greater than our actual cash rent collected 
a positive amount indicates that our straight line rent was less than our actual cash rent collected 
represents the class b and class c preferred stock non cash charges for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
approximately  or  of the  properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes  primarily at fixed rates  and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates  fair values as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value million matures in may million matures in october the credit facility expires in october the credit facility balance as of february  was million 
million matures in january million matures in march  million matures in november  million matures in september and million matures in march we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on the closing market price or indicative price per each note 
the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place at december  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
