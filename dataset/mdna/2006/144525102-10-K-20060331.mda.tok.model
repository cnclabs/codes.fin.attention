as a result of the purchase order nature of these sales  the company is presently uncertain as to the future levels of sales  if any  to these two customers 
a further significant decrease in orders from these two customers would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
at december  and  the company held cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to the sale of the million subordinated notes  the receipt of million in net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and  in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee purchases of shares 
these cash receipts were partially offset by million of cash used in operating activities  the company s investment in property plant and equipment of  debt issuance costs of  and debt and capital lease obligation payments  excluding  for retirement of the mortgage associated with the sale leaseback transaction  of  customers with significant accounts receivable balances at the end of include mannatech  medline  and natural alternatives  and of these amounts  has been collected as of february  the company has a line of credit with comerica bank texas comerica that provides for borrowings of up to million based on the level of qualified accounts receivable and inventory

the covenants and the company s position at december  are as follows covenant covenant requirement company s position total net worth   current ratio liquidity ratio although the company was not in compliance with one of its financial ratio covenants under the comerica line of credit for the period ended december   comerica has waived the event of non compliance through march  the company anticipates renegotiating its financial ratio covenants with comerica and or seeking a waiver for non compliance in periods after march  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in renegotiating its covenants or obtaining a waiver  and the company s ability to do so may be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the company s operating cash flow resulting from the present sales levels to natural alternatives and mannatech 
if the company is unable to renegotiate its covenants or obtain a waiver and the existing covenant defaults continue  comerica could accelerate the indebtedness under the company s credit facility as well as all other debt that the company has outstanding with comerica  if any 
in that event  the company would be forced to refinance all of the comerica indebtedness with another lender 
any such refinancing would likely contain interest rates and terms which are more burdensome for the company than those presently in place under the comerica facility  resulting in an adverse impact on liquidity
