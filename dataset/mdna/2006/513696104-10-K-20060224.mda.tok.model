item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
executive overview in the company experienced solid growth in both telecom and electrical product sales  leading to a record annual net sales level of million  almost higher than the rate of growth slowed slightly to about for shipments of products to support the telecommunication customers construction of fiber to the premise infrastructure 
however  electrical product demand accelerated to a double digit growth rate as residential construction stayed strong and commercial and industrial construction began to have slight growth of around 
the company was significantly impacted by the rising costs of pvc and hdpe resins and compounds 
costs had been steadily increasing throughout the year  much like  but then jumped dramatically by a third in the fourth quarter after the effect of two major gulf coast hurricanes were felt 
prices for the company s pvc conduit increased by about in the fourth quarter over third quarter reflecting the higher costs  increased demand and constrained supply 
transportation continued to be an issue in which was exacerbated by the hurricane recovery efforts 
the company incurred approximately higher freight rates on average in due to fuel cost increases and truck availability 
in the second half of the company encountered process control  equipment and training issues in its pvc pipe extrusion plants as the company attempted to get maximum output from aging equipment 
these issues led to higher than normal scrap rates and inefficiencies impacting the results unfavorably by approximately million 
the company took corrective actions to address these issues including investing in new extrusion equipment  adding additional quality control professionals and developing more formal training programs for hourly associates 
noticeable improvement in operations is anticipated in the second half of from these actions 
at the end of the second quarter of  the company renewed its credit facility for an additional five years see note c 
this lowered the company s effective interest rate and provided more flexibility to pursue growth opportunities 
in summary  net income increased to a record million in compared with million in resulting in diluted earnings per share in versus diluted earnings per share in 
table of contents results of continuing operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for years ended dollars in thousands net sales cost of products sold gross profit total operating expenses litigation settlement other expense operating income interest expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations net sales in rose by or million to million compared with million in all three business segments recorded growth in net sales of over this year 
on an overall basis sales unit volume was up by in while price increases accounted for about of the higher net sales levels 
the breakdown by product or market is more thoroughly discussed in the segment disclosures 
the pvc pipe segment  assisted by an exceptionally strong fourth quarter  expanded net sales by 
carlon continued to see the expansion of product sales to support the telecom infrastructure projects and the initial signs of expansion of commercial construction activity 
lamson home products has added to its product offerings and experienced general market growth as the home improvement retail customers continued to expand 
all three segments obtained price increases in  recouping realized cost increases 
net sales for were million compared with million in  an increase of or million 
carlon  which experienced the highest segment net sales growth rate  was favorably impacted by the increased rollouts of telecom customers fiber to the premise projects 
additional market share growth resulted in the increased net sales in the lamson home products business segment 
price increases instituted to offset rising resin costs were the primary reason for net sales increases in the pvc pipe segment 
operationally  the company continues to focus on a key strategic objective of on time  in full  error free delivery of products and services to our customers 
this objective is tracked daily to limit the amount of backorders and time to ship 
there has been a sustained high level of performance in the company s delivery metrics allowing it to obtain opportunities for market share expansion  especially with its electrical distributors and retail customers 
gross profit in totaled million  or of net sales  an increase of million  or  compared with million  or of net sales  in the company s key raw materials  pvc and hdpe resins  maintained their upward cost trends  rising by double digits again in these increases were more than offset by the higher selling price the company realized 
higher sales volumes this year allowed the company to improve the capacity utilization in its manufacturing facilities by percentage points and to leverage its distribution operations 
unfavorable impact on the company s gross profit came from higher freight costs higher costs per pound shipped driven by fuel costs and limited transportation equipment availability 
manufacturing variance in in the pvc extrusion plants included higher scrap rates and operating inefficiencies million in the second half of the year due to process control  equipment and 
table of contents training issues 
finally  the company has benefited from approximately million in lower medical costs for active associates  due to improved experience and newly implemented cost controls 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in raw material costs including pvc resin and compounds  hdpe resin and steel components climbed by more than double digit percentages in many of these increases were passed on during the year as sales price increases  except in the lamson home products business segment 
freight costs also escalated throughout due to fuel cost increases and driver and equipment shortages  lowering gross margin by 
the company was able  as a whole  to maintain and slightly improve gross margins in compared with due to higher capacity utilization in versus in at the company s manufacturing facilities 
this occurred primarily in the hdpe extrusion plants as lines were run to keep up with the improving telecom demand 
lastly  the company continued to see favorable leveraging of its predominately fixed cost distribution operations  where costs rose by approximately while shipping activity increased by almost 
operating income for was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in  an increase of million or almost 
this improvement comes entirely from higher gross profit while operating expenses increased million  or  to million in compared with million in the majority of these rising operating expenses came from higher variable selling and marketing expenses million and incentive compensation million due to the significant net sales growth and improved operating results  respectively 
operating income for was million  or of net sales  an increase of million  or over the million  or of net sales  earned in this improvement was primarily driven by the growing gross profit 
selling and marketing expenses reflect higher variable selling expenses generated in by the higher net sales levels 
in addition  incentive compensation is approximately million higher due to the significantly improved results this year  legal and professional fees exceeded levels by about thousand from incremental sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and expenditures made to support our announced strategic alternatives review 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in pension and retiree medical expense totaling million and the collection of a previously written off account receivable of million 
overall  operating expenses have declined to of net sales million in from of net sales million in included in operating results in were the net effects of a litigation settlement of million see note e and the sale and closure of the company s pasadena  texas facility see note m 
interest expense continued its downward trend in  declining to million from million in and million in average borrowings in were million  down significantly from million and million in and  respectively 
the average interest rates were   and in  and  respectively 
while variable libor rates have increased this year  the company s average rate has improved as the company s new credit facility see note c has a more favorable interest rate spread and has continued to decline in recent quarters as a result of improved leverage ratios 
the income tax provision for reflects an effective tax rate of compared with in and in approximately half the provision is a non cash charge due to the company s net operating loss carry forward position 
in  the company reversed million of valuation allowance against available general business credits based on continued improved operating results in and projected operating results in during  the company settled certain state tax matters which resulted in a reduction of the current state and local income tax expense by approximately  business segments carlon the carlon business segment had net sales in of million  an increase of million  or  compared with net sales of million in approximately half of this growth million comes from increased demand for this segment s telecom products  mostly hdpe conduit  to support the rollout of fiber to the premise projects 
electrical product demand also expanded in as residential 
table of contents construction remained strong  while commercial and industrial construction slowly rebounded 
the company rolled out both new and improved electrical products to support this market growth in finally  price increases on electrical products  implemented primarily in the first quarter of in response to the rising pvc costs  represent million of the net sales improvement 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  over the million net sales level in approximately million of the increase came from the strong rebound in telecom product sales 
this market demand expansion of almost over is primarily due to the increased rollout of fiber to the premise projects  which utilize hdpe conduit 
carlon was able to raise pricing in in response to the higher raw material resin costs being incurred  which resulted in approximately million higher net sales than finally  the carlon business segment net sales were supported by a steady residential construction market and a slow upturn in non residential construction activity late in gross profit in for carlon is approximately percentage points better than in price increases implemented early in the year offset the raw material cost increases experienced throughout expanded volume of molded and fabricated electrical product and hdpe conduit sales helped increase manufacturing plant utilization and allowed the company to continue to leverage fixed costs  especially in the distribution operations 
gross margin expanded throughout with the higher telecom sales volume and the price increases on electrical products that were realized this year 
plant utilization of the hdpe conduit facilities was about five percentage points higher than the sales volume increase also helped carlon realize benefits from leveraging fixed costs  especially in the company s distribution centers 
operating income for carlon totaled million  or of net sales  in compared with million  or of net sales  in representing an improvement of million  or 
this increase comes from improved gross profit results as operating expenses rose by million in over the prior year 
operating expenses  in  were impacted by increased variable selling and marketing expenses million and incentive compensation  while the segment incurred a charge of  for a litigation settlement in see notes e and l 
operating income for carlon was million  of net sales  in compared with million  of net sales  in  an increase of million or 
included in operating income in is a charge of approximately  for this business segment s share of a litigation settlement see notes e and l 
the growth in operating income comes primarily from the higher net sales and resultant higher gross margins  which were offset slightly by increased variable selling expenses of million 
lamson home products net sales for lamson home products reached million in an increase of million  or  compared with net sales of million 
this growth came primarily from underlying market expansion of almost as new and existing home sales  which generate much of the do it yourself home improvement project demand  were at near record levels this year 
in addition  lamson home products continues to expand its product line through innovative new products introduced to current customers million 
finally  in the first quarter of  the segment increased selling prices an average of in order to partially recoup the significant cost increases of around in pvc and other raw materials 
net sales in the lamson home products business segment continued its steady rise reaching million in  a million  or  increase over the million in net sales level in the underlying economics of the do it yourself home improvement market remains very solid  supported by strong existing and new home sales and low interest rates 
in addition  the company has maintained its high level of operational performance this year 
the net sales in include the full year impact of the additional market share obtained in mid of approximately million 
lamson home products has added its door chimes product line to a couple of major retail customers in the second half of impacting net sales by million 
none of the net sales growth in is attributable to price increases despite the significant cost increases absorbed in 
table of contents gross margin for lamson home products business segment in is nominally improved over the level  as selling price increases were offset by continued pvc compound and other raw material cost increases of over this year 
lamson home products segment gross margins were affected unfavorably by the over increase in pvc compound cost during as indicated above  no selling price increases were obtained in from the retail customer base to offset these cost increases causing an erosion of over basis points of gross margin 
in addition  higher distribution expenses were incurred in  million  from the substantial increased volume of shipments 
operating income was million  of net sales  in compared with million  of net sales in operating expenses in were million less than the prior year  primarily due to the  charge for a litigation settlement in higher incentive compensation expenses in were offset by lower product development costs  million  than had been incurred in operating income was million  of net sales in  compared with million  of net sales  in the million decline in operating income comes primarily from reduced gross margins 
in addition  like carlon  this business segment was charged with  for its share of a litigation settlement in see notes e and l 
lamson home products also incurred higher variable selling expenses  million  and product development costs  million  to support  the expansion of the chimes and lighting control product lines 
pvc pipe net sales in the pvc pipe business segment totaled million in  an increase of million  or  over the net sales of million 
the fourth quarter of saw this segment impacted dramatically by hurricanes katrina and rita as pvc resin suppliers were forced to declare force majeure thereby constraining the supply of pvc resin to end market producers 
the company was able to get most of the resin it needed to continue production at a somewhat reduced rate 
demand for conduit products remained strong and backlogs grew to historically high levels 
this resulted in shipments in the fourth quarter increasing almost while price per pound was about higher than the prior year fourth quarter 
total volume of pipe pounds shipped for was up by while pricing was an average higher compared with the pvc pipe business segment experienced net sales growth of million  or  to million in from million in rigid pipe sales volume was very strong in the fourth quarter of exceeding the fourth quarter by and bringing total year volume of pounds sold in approximately even with non residential and telecom infrastructure construction spending began rebounding late in the year while residential construction activity was healthy throughout this business segment was able to raise pricing by around in  which helped to offset pvc resin cost increases 
finally  this segment experienced higher sales  million  of the vylon large diameter sewer pipe products to support several sewer infrastructure projects 
gross margin expanded in by approximately percentage points as price increases supported by solid demand out paced average pvc resin cost increases of 
this allowed the company to restore the gross margin level that had eroded in recent years due to higher raw material costs and relatively soft end markets 
higher freight costs negatively impacted this segment s gross margin as rates were about more than or million more in expense 
finally  in the second half of  the pvc extrusion plants incurred higher than usual scrap rates and operating inefficiencies million caused primarily by process control  equipment and training issues 
gross margins in the pvc pipe business segment improved in as net sales prices increased to offset much of the approximate increase in resin costs 
in addition  the segment experienced favorable product mix  with vylon pipe and telecommunication duct becoming a higher percentage of sales 
finally  the segment has begun to realize some of the cost savings from capital investments made to increase productivity and reduce costs  such as the blend plant additions and automation projects completed in the pvc pipe segment generated million of operating income in  or of net sales  compared with an operating loss of million in the entire operating income in the current year was earned in the fourth quarter of as this segment was approximately breakeven through the first three quarters of 
table of contents operating expenses were about million higher in compared with primarily from increased variable selling expenses and incentive compensation 
operating results for the pvc pipe business were greatly improved in compared with the operating loss was narrowed from a million loss  of net sales  in to a million loss  of net sales  in this improvement comes primarily from better gross margins as operating expenses have increased this year as a result of higher variable selling expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is cash generated from operating activities and availability under its credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities more than doubled in to million compared with million in and million in the significantly higher operating cash flow in came from the much improved operating income levels  which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable carried at the year end due to strong fourth quarter net sales 
accounts receivable at the end of totaled million compared with million at the end of despite this increased balance  days sales outstanding improved slightly at year end representing days down from days and days at and year end  respectively 
inventories at the end of were higher by million  or  at million  up from the million year end balance 
in  inventory balances rose by million 
due to the higher sales levels  especially in the fourth quarter of  and a resin shortage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes  inventory turns improved to a record times in from times in and times in the pounds of pvc resin inventory at december  are approximately lower than the prior year as the company s resin supply was impacted by resin manufacturers force majeur situations 
the cost per pound  however  is almost higher than such costs at january   which itself had risen by over compared with the cost per pound at year end 
hdpe per pound resin costs in inventory at december  have also increased by about since the beginning of the year 
the inventory increases in and were offset by higher accounts payable balances 
due to the timing of the year end december   a number of payments of certain vendor liabilities were made in  primarily resin and lease payments  compared with the company made cash contributions of million to support pension and other post retirement benefit plans in million in and million in  primarily to defined benefit pension plan trust funds or for retiree medical payments 
included in the contributions  is a discretionary million voluntary contribution to one of its defined benefit pension plans in order to fully fund all qualified pension plans at december   thereby  eliminating million of additional minimum pension liability 
the company s cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased this year to million after investing million in additions in the current year s capital expenditures were spent on replacement and upgrading of molds  the modernization of pvc extrusion equipment  and continued manufacturing process automation 
in  the company also received million proceeds from the sale of fixed assets  primarily the pasadena  texas plant 
the company s cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
due to the million of cash generated from operations in  the company was able to pay down million in long term debt this year 
the company continues to have substantial credit capacity with availability of around million at december  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at december  and is expected to maintain compliance throughout the remainder of the term of the agreement 
lastly  in and  due to the company s rising stock prices  the company received cash proceeds of million and million  respectively  as  and  shares  respectively  were issued from the exercise of stock options in the respective years 

table of contents outlook for telecom spending in remained on the upswing increasing by over to support rollouts of fiber to the premise projects 
verizon communications  one of the company s key telecom customers plans to pass fiber optic cable to million homes in  up from the million homes connected in in addition  it is anticipated that at t formerly sbc will accelerate their new fiber to the premise programs in overall  management expects the telecom product sales to grow another in residential construction remained very strong in with housing starts exceeding the million unit mark and new and existing home sales reaching new highs 
at the end of the year  home sales activity had begun to moderate as evidenced by a month backlog of houses on the market 
with mortgage interest rates remaining stable and unemployment rates remaining less than in  it is anticipated that residential construction will decline only slightly to around million units in light commercial and industrial construction began to see some increased activity in the second half of this demand for facilities to support the residential neighborhoods  institutional construction and the beginning of the gulf coast rebuilding effort should support the company s estimated growth rate in these markets of in due to the damage caused by two hurricanes hitting the gulf coast late in the third quarter of  all major pvc resin suppliers declared force majeure 
this situation resulted in constrained resin supply and significantly higher resin and transit costs throughout the last four months of this year 
the continued demand for conduit products  coupled with material shortages and cost increases  drove the selling price of the company s pvc conduit products up dramatically and led to higher than usual backlog and delivery lead times 
in early  the resin producers have returned to normal operations and much of the excess backlog has been shipped 
it is expected that only slight moderation in resin costs will take place in as the general global economy is strong  resin producers were operating at over of capacity before the impact of the hurricanes and no significant capacity additions will affect supply until the second half of the company generated almost million in cash from operating activities in inventories  however  due to the strong shipments of pipe in the fourth quarter and raw material shortages  are at lower than normal levels and will be replenished before the spring construction season begins in capital spending in is expected to be between million as the company invests in upgrading its extrusion equipment  provides additional automation in all facilities and adds incremental molds and tooling to support market growth and new products 
lastly  management intends to further reduce the debt leverage in but will also look at potential acquisitions to further grow the business 
in summary  we believe net sales in will increase in line with our long term target of growth 
management also expects to exceed the comparative earnings levels for each of the first three quarters of  but will not duplicate the extremely strong fourth quarter of results 
for the first quarter of  the company estimates that net sales will be in a range of million to million  an increase of to over the first quarter of this improved sales level may result in net income of million to million  or to per diluted share in the first quarter of critical accounting policies the company is required to make estimates and judgments in the preparation of its financial statements 
these estimates and judgments affect the asset and liability amounts reported  as well as revenues and expenses and other disclosures 
the company routinely reviews these estimates and the underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances 
changes in estimates or judgments by management could have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
the company believes the following are the most significant accounting policies  which utilize estimates that are inherently uncertain and  therefore  based on management s judgment 
accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances against accounts receivable for amounts that may come uncollectible in the future 
the company records reserves for bad debt based on a variety of factors including customer s 
table of contents operating results and financial condition  the length of time receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  the company may be required to record additional bad debt allowances 
the company also has a significant volume of customer deductions  as is customary in the retail and electrical product markets 
these deductions primarily relate to pricing  freight and shipment quantity discrepancies 
the company strives to resolve these discrepancies on a timely basis to limit the accounts receivable collectibility issues 
estimates are made by management  based primarily on historical experience  as to the collectibility of deductions 
historically  except for the recovery of accounts receivables written off due to bankruptcies  there have not been material changes in estimates to the accounts receivable allowance 
inventory valuation the company routinely evaluates its inventories to ensure they are carried at lower cost or market value and to identify obsolete or excess inventory 
a sudden decline in pvc or hdpe resin costs  coupled with a slow down in sales volume  could result in the write down of inventory valuations 
in recent years  resin prices and end markets have improved resulting in no inventory valuation write downs 
in addition  with some of the supply chain improvements made in the last couple of years  the company carries less than two months worth of resin in inventory  which helps to mitigate the risk of write downs 
reserves are provided for obsolete and excess inventory by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual quantities on hand 
the total reserve at december  is million and has remained fairly consistent from year to year 
much of the company s products  when scrapped  can be re ground and the material put back into the manufacturing process 
there has not been a significant change in estimates relating to this inventory reserve in the last several years 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other post retirement benefits is impacted by management s assumptions related to discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and healthcare trend rates 
variations in the pension plan assumptions including changes in discount rates  actual pension plan asset performance and actual compensation rate increases will either increase or decrease the unamortized actuarial gains or losses  which affects future pension expense 
the company currently has a million of unrecognized actuarial loss for its defined benefit pension plans 
this is primarily the result of lower discount rates  going from in to in  which impacted the funded status by approximately million in this time period 
the current discount rate was selected by management based on an analysis of interest rates that would be incurred to settle this liability 
another major portion of the unrecognized loss is caused by net asset actuarial loss actual return was less than the assumed rate of return of about million since finally  mortality rates were changed in to use the latest available information increasing the actuarial loss by million 
the plans incurred actuarial loss of million in and reflecting the reduction in stock market equity values 
in through  the company has experienced million of actuarial asset gains as the stock market has rebounded and exceeded management s expected rate of return 
for  the expected rate of return on plan assets is  down from in this is the rate of return anticipated by management in the long term  based on plan asset mix 
the salary rate of increase is estimated to be and has over the past few years  been representative of annual increases 
likewise  variations between actual and estimated healthcare trend rates will affect retiree medical expense in the future see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and legal obligations management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation 
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws  regulations and their interpretation  the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination  and improvements in technology 
at december  the company has million accrued for environmental matters at a property sold by the company in the liability is reassessed periodically and includes the costs of certain remediation activities which are anticipated to take 
table of contents place over an extended period of time 
based on the current year activity  the company recognized a million change in estimate  increasing this reserve 
historically  there have not been any material changes in estimates see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates  based on the facts and circumstances and application of laws in individual cases 
at december  the company did not have any unsettled litigation that required accrual 
during  the company settled a patent infringement case with the net effect of the settlement of million reflected in the operating results see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  including loss carryforwards that expire through and other temporary differences 
significant factors considered by management in the determination of the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets include historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the extended period of time over which tax deductible goodwill is amortized and other post retirement medical benefits will be paid 
the company would need to generate approximately million in taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforward to in order to realize the benefits on its tax return 
the company has never had a net operating loss carryforward expire without being used 
current expectations of operating results are sufficient to sustain realization of these net assets 
however  should taxable income estimates for the carryforward period be significantly reduced  the full realization of net deferred tax assets may not occur 
at december  the company had no valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets reflecting management s assessment that the company s million general business tax credits will be realized 
the valuation allowance of million at january  was partially reversed due to the current and expected future years results  with the remainder being utilized as million of tax credits expired unused in goodwill valuation as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has goodwill of million  the majority of which relates to the telecom reporting unit in the carlon business segment 
an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or more frequently as conditions warrant 
the latest test as of october  resulted in no impairment 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the telecom reporting unit 
inherent in such fair value determinations  which use both discontinued cash flow and market multiple methodologies  are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material write down of goodwill 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purpose entities spes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company leases certain real properties and equipment with unrelated third parties as disclosed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period dollars in thousands total to to after contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total at december  the company had purchase commitments of approximately million for capital expenditures which will be funded with the credit facility 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain expectations that are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those expected as a result of a variety of factors  such as i the volatility of resin pricing  ii the ability of the company to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers  iii the continued availability of raw materials and consistent electrical power supplies  iv maintaining a stable level of housing starts  telecommunications infrastructure spending  consumer confidence and general construction trends and v any adverse change in the recovery trend of the country s general economic condition affecting the markets for the company s products 
because forward looking statements are based on a number of beliefs  estimates and assumptions by management that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate  there is no assurance that any forward looking statement will prove to be accurate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to commodity prices for pvc and hdpe resins and changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include pvc and hdpe resins and compounds 
the company s financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials 
the company closely monitors its inventory levels and requirements for these materials and utilizes multiple suppliers where possible 
the company does not actively hedge or use derivative instruments in the management of its inventories 
the company s credit facility obligation bears interest at a variable rate 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  the company at times enters into interest rate swap agreements 
the company has no interest rate swap agreements in place at the end of these risks and others that are detailed in this form k must be considered by any investor or potential investor in the company
