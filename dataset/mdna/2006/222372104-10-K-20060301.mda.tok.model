item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as used in this report  references to we  our  the company or countrywide refer to countrywide financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated 
overview countrywide is a diversified financial services company engaged in mortgage finance related businesses 
we organize our operations into five business segments mortgage banking  banking  capital markets  insurance and global operations 
our goal is to continue as a leader in the mortgage banking business and to use this leadership position to take advantage of meaningful opportunities that leverage this business and provide sources of earnings that are sustainable in various interest rate environments 
this section gives an overview of critical items that are discussed in more detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations our consolidated net earnings for were  million  an increase of from s net earnings of  million 
this increase was primarily due to increased profitability of our banking segment resulting from growth in average interest earning assets from mortgage market the mortgage banking business continues to be the primary source of our revenues and earnings 
therefore  the dominant external influence on our operating results is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans in the us  which is affected by such factors as prevailing mortgage interest rates and the strength of the us housing market 
for the year ended december   total us residential mortgage production was estimated at trillion compared to trillion for the year ended december  we increased our market share to for from in the year ago period 
mortgage market source mortgage bankers association 
we attribute the increase in market share to operational effectiveness rather than aggressive pricing 
third party forecasters predict total us mortgage production for to be between trillion and trillion  compared to trillion in due to differences in products represented and model estimation logic  mortgage market estimates vary 
we estimate the mortgage market for to be trillion compared to our estimate of trillion for loan production our total loan production volume increased during largely because we increased our market share 
our adjustable rate loan production has remained relatively constant from last year at of total loan production 
although adjustable rate production has remained constant  the composition has changed due to the increase in pay option loans which provide borrowers with the option to make fully amortizing  interest only  or negative amortizing payments 
pay option loans have increased from approximately of our loan production during the year ended december   to approximately of our production during the year ended december  these loans provide our production sector with greater pricing margins  our servicing sector with increased servicing complexity during their option period  and  to the extent these loans are retained in the bank s portfolio  our banking segment with lower initial net interest income during the period of the loans reduced introductory interest rate 
approximately of the pay option loans produced in was originated for sale without recourse 
the remainder of these loans  which amount to billion  were retained in the bank s portfolio of loans held for investment 
our pay option loan portfolio has a relatively high initial loan quality  with original average fico scores a measure of credit rating of and original loan to value and combined loan to values of and  respectively 
we only originate pay option loans to borrowers who can qualify at the loan s fully indexed interest rates 
this high credit quality notwithstanding  lower initial payment requirements of pay option loans may increase the credit risk inherent in our loans held for investment 
this is because when the required monthly payments for pay option loans eventually increase in a period not to exceed months  borrowers may be less able to pay the increased amounts and  therefore  more likely to default on the loan  than a borrower with an amortizing loan 
our exposure to this higher credit risk is increased by any negative amortization that has been added to the principal balance 
interest rate risk and credit risk the principal market risk we face is interest rate risk the risk that the value of our assets or liabilities or our net interest income will change due to changes in interest rates 
market risk is most directly reflected in the value of our interest rate lock commitments  inventory of loans held for sale  trading securities  investment in other financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights msrs 
we manage market risk primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production operations and our investment in msrs  as well as with various financial instruments including derivatives 
the primary objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
we also face credit risk  primarily related to our residential mortgage production activities in both the mortgage banking and banking segments 
credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk most directly affects our mortgage loans held for investment and our other financial instruments that are credit subordinated to other securities 
we manage mortgage credit risk principally by selling most of the mortgage loans that we produce and by retaining high credit quality mortgages in our loan portfolio 
our prime mortgage loans are generally sold on a non recourse basis 
our prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans are generally sold with recourse  with credit risk limited to the carrying value of residual securities we hold 
losses from hurricanes hurricane katrina and other hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter of affected the financial results of several of our business segments 
hurricane katrina is notable because unlike other hurricanes it caused losses as a result of flooding that many borrowers had not  and would not generally be expected to be  insured against 
the estimated losses from these hurricanes  primarily hurricane katrina  consist of a charge to our insurance operations as well as uninsured losses associated with flood damage on properties that collateralize mortgage loans and loans underlying msrs and residuals 
the effect on pre tax and after tax earnings is summarized below segment pre tax effect after tax effect source in thousands in thousands mortgage banking estimated credit losses relating to loans held for sale and to credit subordinated retained interests  impairment of msrs and provision for servicing advances relating to government insured loans banking estimated credit losses relating to loans held for investment capital markets estimated losses relating to conduit activities insurance estimated insured losses we continue to assess the impact of the hurricanes on our businesses  assets and operations 
while our estimates are based on our best available information  they could ultimately be affected by many factors  including  but not limited to  the short term and long term impact on the economies of the affected communities  the conduct of borrowers in the affected areas  the actions of various third parties  including government agencies and government sponsored enterprises that support housing  insurance companies  lenders and mortgage insurance companies  the apportionment of liability among insurers  the availability of catastrophic reinsurance proceeds  factors impacting property values in the affected areas  including any environmental factors such as the presence of toxic chemicals  and subsequent storm activity 
as new information becomes available we will continue to adjust our loss estimates on a prospective basis 
liquidity and capital our liquidity and financing requirements are significant 
we meet these requirements in a variety of ways  including use of the public corporate debt and equity markets  mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and through the financing activities of our bank 
the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate  diverse and reliable sources of cash are available to meet our funding needs on a cost effective basis 
our ability to raise financing at the level and cost required to compete effectively is dependent on maintaining our high credit standing 
how we grow our businesses and meet our financing needs is influenced by regulatory agency and public debt rating agency capital requirements 
these requirements influence the nature of the financing we are able to obtain and the rate at which we are able to grow 
at december   we exceeded the regulatory capital requirements to be classified as well capitalized  with tier capital ratio of and total risk based ratio of 
our public ratings were classified investment grade  with long term ratings of a  a and a by standard poors  moody s investors service and fitch  respectively 
we meet our financing needs in a variety of ways  through the public corporate debt and equity markets  as well as the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and through the deposit gathering and other financing activities of our bank 
competition the mortgage industry has undergone rapid consolidation in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
today the industry is dominated by large  sophisticated financial institutions 
to compete effectively in this business  we are required to maintain a high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise  as well as to attract capital at a competitive cost 
we believe that we will benefit from industry consolidation through increased market share 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies with the greatest impact on our financial condition and results of operations  and which require the most judgment  pertain to our mortgage securitization activities  our investments in msrs and other retained interests  and our use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our critical accounting policies involve the following three areas accounting for gains on sales of loans and securities  accounting for msrs and other retained interests  including valuation of these retained interests  and accounting for derivatives and our related interest rate risk management activities 
our accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement section of this report 
gain on sale of loans and securities most of the mortgage loans we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of securities and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
when we sell loans in the secondary mortgage market we generally retain the msrs 
depending on the type of securitization  there may be other interests we retain including interest only securities  principal only securities and residual securities 
we determine the gain on sale of a security or loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between securities or loans sold and the interests retained  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale we report is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities or loans sold 
the timing of such gain recognition is dependent on meeting very specific accounting criteria and  as a result  the gain on sale may be recorded in a different accounting period from when the securitization was completed 
in addition  we may sell or securitize loans in a different accounting period from when the loans were originated 
here is an example of how this accounting works carrying value of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security retained interests total fair value computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less cost allocated to security  x  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   the carrying value of mortgage loans includes the outstanding principal balance of the loans  net of deferred origination costs and fees  any premiums or discounts and any basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting 
accounting for msrs and other retained interests msrs are carried at the lower of their amortized cost or fair value 
therefore  once msrs have been recorded  they must be periodically amortized and evaluated for impairment 
we compute msr amortization by applying the ratio of the net msr cash flows projected for the current period to the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows 
the estimated total net msr cash flows are determined at the beginning of each reporting period  using prepayment assumptions applicable at that time 
impairment occurs when the current fair value of the msrs fall below the asset s amortized cost basis 
we stratify our msrs by predominate risk characteristic when evaluating for impairment 
if msrs are impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
if the value of the msrs subsequently increases  the recovery in value is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a reduction in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the msr impairment valuation allowance was billion 
if impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  the valuation allowance is applied to reduce the cost basis of the msrs 
other retained interests are designated as trading or available for sale securities at the time of securitization 
once the other retained interests are recorded they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
other retained interests classified as available for sale securities are marked to market with changes in value recognized as a component of shareholders equity net of tax 
if the security is impaired and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  it is recognized in current period earnings 
once we record this impairment  we recognize subsequent increases in the value of these other retained interests in earnings over the estimated remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield 
other retained interests classified as trading securities are marked to market with all changes in estimated fair value recognized in current period earnings 
valuation of msrs and other retained interests the precise market value of retained interests cannot be readily determined because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
considerable judgment is required to determine the fair values of our retained interests  and the exercise of such judgment can significantly impact the company s earnings 
therefore  senior financial management exercises extensive and active oversight of this process 
the company s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of several of our senior financial executives  ultimately determines the valuation of msrs and other retained interests 
our msr valuation process combines the use of a sophisticated discounted cash flow model and extensive analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet date 
the cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model are based on our empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our msrs  which we believe are consistent with assumptions used by market participants valuing similar msrs  and from data obtained on the performance of similar msrs 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and the discount rate projected libor plus option adjusted spread 
these variables can  and generally will  change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
the current market data utilized in the msr valuation process and in the assessment of the reasonableness of our valuation is obtained from msr trades  msr broker valuations  prices of interest only securities  and peer group msr valuation surveys 
for our other retained interests  we also estimate fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of our other retained interests include mortgage prepayment speeds  discount rates  and for residual interests containing credit risk  the net lifetime credit losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk management section in this report for further discussion of credit risk 
we develop cash flow and prepayment assumptions based on our own data drawn from the historical performance of the loans underlying our other retained interests 
we believe that such empirical data are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants would use in determining the assets fair value 
the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our msrs at december   and the value sensitivity of our msrs to changes in such assumptions 
msrs dollar amounts in thousands fair value of msrs carrying value of msrs carrying value as a percentage of msr portfolio weighted average service fee weighted average life in years multiple of net service fee weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average oas impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change option adjusted spread over libor 
the yield implied in the market value of the msrs was at december  the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our other retained interests at december   and the fair value sensitivity of our other retained interests to changes in such assumptions 
other retained interests dollar amounts in thousands fair value of retained interests weighted average life in years weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average annual discount rate impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average net lifetime credit losses impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change these sensitivities are solely for illustrative purposes and should be used with caution 
this information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in key assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a given percentage variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated 
in addition  in the above tables  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interests is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may coincide with changes in another  which could compound or counteract the sensitivities 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities we use derivatives extensively in connection with our interest rate risk management activities 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
we may qualify some of our interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting 
a primary requirement to qualify for hedge accounting is the documented demonstration initially and on an ongoing basis that our interest rate risk management activity is highly effective 
we use standard statistical measures to determine the effectiveness of our hedging activity 
if we are unable to  or choose not to  qualify certain interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then a possible earnings mismatch may be created because  unlike the derivative instruments  the change in fair value of the related asset or liability may not be reflected in current period earnings 
this issue is potentially most significant regarding msrs and inventory of loans held for sale  which are required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or market 
in connection with our mortgage loan origination activities  we issue interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
the irlcs guarantee a loan s terms  subject to credit approval  for a period typically between seven and days 
the majority of our irlcs are derivative instruments and  therefore  are required to be recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
however  unlike most other derivative instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine their fair value 
consequently  we have developed a method for estimating the fair value of our irlcs 
we estimate the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  adjusted for the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based on quoted mbs prices and is measured from the date we issue the commitment 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the primary factor influencing the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability of funding increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the application  age of the application  purpose for the loan purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using historical empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
these closing ratio estimates are used to calculate the number of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the irlcs 
results of operations comparison year ended december   and year ended december  consolidated earnings performance our earnings were  million for  a increase from our diluted earnings per share for were  a increase from diluted earnings per share from the year ago period 
the increase in our earnings was primarily the result of an increase in the profitability of our banking segment which produced pre tax earnings of  million  up from the year ago period 
this increase was due mainly to a increase in average interest earning assets at countrywide bank from the year ago period 
the mortgage banking segment produced pre tax earnings of  million for  an increase of 
in the mortgage banking segment  improved financial performance of our msrs was for the most part offset by a decline in the profitability of our loan production sector 
production sector pre tax earnings were affected by market price pressure  which offset the positive impact of increased sales of prime mortgage loans and nonprime mortgage loans 
loan production sector pre tax earnings were  million for  a decrease of  million from the year ago period 
the pre tax earnings in the loan servicing sector  which incorporates the performance of our msrs and other retained interests  was million  an improvement of  million from the year ago period 
this increase in pre tax earnings was primarily attributable to higher revenue resulting from a increase in the size of the average loan servicing portfolio  higher earnings on escrow balances and an improvement in the amount of impairment recovery of our retained interests  net of the servicing hedge 
operating segment results pre tax earnings loss by segment are summarized below years ended december  in thousands mortgage banking loan production loan servicing loan closing services total mortgage banking banking capital markets insurance global operations other total the pre tax earnings loss of each segment include intercompany transactions  which are eliminated in the other category above 
mortgage loan production by segment and product  net of intercompany sales  is summarized below years ended december  in millions segment mortgage banking banking capital markets conduit acquisitions commercial real estate product prime mortgage nonprime mortgage prime home equity commercial real estate acquisitions from third parties 
the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose non purchase purchase interest rate type adjustable rate fixed rate mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment includes the loan production  loan servicing and loan closing services sectors 
the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform most profitably when mortgage interest rates are relatively low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage interest rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
we expect the natural counterbalance of these sectors to continue to reduce the impact of changes in mortgage interest rates on our earnings 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through the four production divisions of countrywide home loans chl consumer markets  wholesale lending  correspondent lending and full spectrum lending  and  beginning in the third quarter of  through countrywide bank 
mortgage banking loan production volume for increased from the year ago period 
our market share increased in  which resulted in an increase in both purchase and non purchase loan production 
purchase loan production increased from the year ago period 
the increase in purchase loans is significant because this component of the mortgage market has historically offered relatively stable growth  averaging per year over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile because it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage interest rates 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose non purchase purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate in  of our loan production was adjustable rate in comparison to in the year ago period 
the decrease in adjustable rate production reflects the increase in short term interest rates during the current period and the relatively flat yield curve  increasing the relative attractiveness of fixed rate financing 
while virtually unchanged as a percentage of total loans funded  the volume of mortgage banking nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans produced which is included in our total volume of loans produced increased during compared to the year ago period 
details are shown in the following table years ended december  dollar amounts in millions nonprime mortgage loans prime home equity loans percent of total mortgage banking loan production the pre tax earnings of the loan production sector are summarized below years ended december  amount percentage of loan production volume amount percentage of loan production volume dollar amounts in thousands revenues prime mortgage nonprime mortgage prime home equity total revenues expenses compensation other operating allocated corporate total expenses pre tax earnings total mortgage banking loan production despite an increase in loan production  revenues in dollars and expressed as a percentage of mortgage loans produced decreased over the year ago period 
production sector revenues were affected by market price pressure and by the effect of flattening of the yield curve on the net interest income earned while we hold loans for sale 
normally  a decline in net interest income caused by a flatter yield curve would be mitigated by an increase in gain on sale  but in this was hindered by pricing pressure 
in  billion of mortgage loans  or of loan production  was sold compared to billion of mortgage loans  or of loan production  in this decline in sales as a percentage of production contributed to the decline in revenues as a percentage of mortgage loan production in the current year 
expenses increased from the year ago period  primarily due to an increase in loan production 
a shift in the mix of production towards our correspondent channel  which traditionally has the lowest cost structure  helped reduce expenses expressed as a percentage of production compared to the prior year 
we continued to expand our loan production operations in to support our long term objective of market share growth 
during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity  compared to during the year ago period 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity by multiplying the number of our loan operations personnel by the number of loans we expect each loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
management adjusts staffing levels to account for changes in the current and projected near term mortgage market 
we plan to continue building our sales staff as a primary means to increase our market share  particularly for purchase loans 
the following table summarizes the number of people included in the loan production sector workforce workforce at december  sales operations regular employees temporary staff production technology administration and support total loan production sector workforce the following table shows total mortgage banking loan production volume by division years ended december  in millions correspondent lending consumer markets wholesale lending full spectrum lending countrywide bank the correspondent lending division increased its overall loan production volume due primarily to an increase in the mortgage market combined with increased market share resulting from a shift in consumer preference towards agency conforming and pay option loan products where we have a large market share 
the consumer markets division continues to expand its commissioned sales force  which emphasizes purchase loan production  to  at december   an increase of  or  over the year ago period 
this division s branch network has grown to branch offices at december   an increase of offices from december  the consumer markets division s commissioned sales force contributed billion in purchase originations during  a increase over the year ago period 
such purchase production generated by the commissioned sales force represented of the consumer markets division s total purchase production for the wholesale and full spectrum lending divisions also continue to increase their sales forces as a means to increase market share 
at december   the sales force in the wholesale lending division numbered  an increase of compared to december  the full spectrum lending division expanded its sales force to  an increase of compared to december  and has expanded its branch network to branch offices at december   an increase of offices over the year ago period 
loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector includes approximately  employees who service our million mortgage loans 
the loan servicing sector s results include fees and other income earned and expenses incurred for servicing loans for others  the financial performance of our investments in msrs and other retained interests and associated risk management activities  and profits from subservicing activities in the united states 
the long term performance of this sector is affected primarily by the level of interest rates  the corresponding effect on the level of projected and actual prepayments in our servicing portfolio  our operational effectiveness and our ability to manage interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the results for the loan servicing sector years ended december  amount percentage of average servicing portfolio amount percentage of average servicing portfolio dollar amounts in thousands servicing fees  net of guarantee fees miscellaneous fees income from other retained interests escrow balance income expense amortization of mortgage servicing rights recovery impairment of retained interests servicing hedge losses total servicing revenues operating expenses allocated corporate expenses total servicing expenses interest expense pre tax earnings loss average servicing portfolio our servicing portfolio grew to  billion at december   a increase from december  at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate of loans in our servicing portfolio increased to from at december  pre tax earnings in the loan servicing sector were million during  an improvement of  million from the year ago period 
such earnings improved due to a increase in the average servicing portfolio  an increase in escrow balance benefit due to higher short term interest rates and improvement in the value of our retained interests  net of the servicing hedge  which resulted from reduced actual and anticipated prepayment rates 
the servicing sector was negatively impacted in the current year by hurricane losses of million 
loan closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies  which provide credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals  property valuation services and title reports primarily to the loan production sector but to third parties as well 
the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  an increase of from the year ago period 
the increase in landsafe s pre tax earnings was primarily due to the increase in our loan origination activity 
banking segment the banking segment includes the investment and fee based activities of countrywide bank  along with the activities of countrywide warehouse lending  a provider of mortgage inventory financing to independent mortgage bankers 
part of our banking strategy is to hold loans in portfolio rather than immediately selling them into the secondary mortgage market 
management believes this strategy will provide a stream of earnings over the life of such loans  create a greater base of future earnings and enhance the stability of earnings growth 
in the short term  reported consolidated profits will be impacted by the reduction in gains that would have been recognizable had the loans been sold 
countrywide bank  na the bank also produces loans for sale through our mortgage banking segment 
as this activity is a mortgage banking activity  the mortgage loan production and the income relating to the sale of these loans is included in the mortgage banking segment 
the production of loans by countrywide bank for our mortgage banking operations is a means to manage growth of the bank s portfolio of loans held for investment while complying with regulatory requirements 
the banking segment achieved pre tax earnings of  million during  as compared to million for the year ago period

average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on average amortized cost computed on the settlement date basis 
the increase in net interest income is primarily due to a billion or increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point reduction in net interest margin 
net interest margin experienced compression during from the year ago period mainly as a result of a lag in the re pricing of the bank s loan portfolio compared to the increase in the cost of its interest bearing liabilities and to the large volume of loans held by the bank that are earning interest at their reduced introductory interest rates 
countrywide bank increased its investment in pay option loans during these loans have interest rates that adjust monthly and contain features that allow the borrower to defer making the full interest payment for at least the first year of the loan 
thereafter  minimum monthly payments increase by no more than per year unless the unpaid balance increases to a specified limit  which is no more than of the original loan amount  at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established 
to ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan  the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re established every five years 
our underwriting standards conform to those required to make the pay option loans salable into the secondary market at the date of funding  including a requirement that the borrower meet secondary market debt service ratio tests based on the borrower making the fully amortizing loan payment assuming the loan s interest rate is fully indexed 
a fully indexed loan rate equals the sum of the current index rate plus the margin applicable to the loan

the provision for loan losses increased during compared to due to the increase in mortgage loans held for investment along with the continued seasoning of the loans we have added during the past years and the estimated losses from hurricane katrina 
we expect our provision for loan losses and the related allowance for loan losses to increase as a percentage of our portfolio of loans held for investment as our portfolio continues to season 
the impact of the increase in the allowance for loan losses will be partially mitigated by the addition of new loans to our portfolio

capital markets segment our capital markets segment achieved pre tax earnings of million for  a decrease of million  or  from total revenues were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ago period 
during  capital markets realized million in revenue from its commercial real estate finance activities 
partially offsetting this increase in revenue  market conditions caused by rising short term interest rates and a flattening of the yield curve resulted in lower revenue from conduit and securities trading operations 
the capital markets segment has expanded its capacity in its existing business lines and its investment in new lines of business such as commercial real estate finance and broker dealer operations in japan  which contributed to an increase in expenses of million  or  compared to the year ago period

conduit revenues for decreased in comparison to the year ago period  primarily because of a decrease in margins  driven by a flattening of the yield curve and increased competition 
underwriting revenues decreased million over the year ago period because of decreased underwriting of chl securitizations by capital markets and a decrease in margins 
trading volumes increased from the year ago period excluding us treasury securities 
including us treasury securities  the total securities volume traded increased over the year ago period 
despite the increase in trading volumes  securities trading revenue declined due to a decline in trading margins and a shift in product mix to lower margin product

gain on sale of prime home equity loans decreased in as compared to due primarily to lower margins combined with a decrease in the volume of loans sold 
gain on sale of reperforming loans decreased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in the volume of loans sold combined with lower margins 
reperforming loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted and were repurchased from mortgage securitization trusts we sponsor 
the note rate on these loans is typically higher than the currently offered mortgage interest rates and therefore  the margin on these loans is typically higher than margins on prime mortgage loans 
the decrease in capital markets gain on sale related to its conduit activities was due to a decline in margins partially offset by increased sales of mortgage loans 
the increase in capital markets gain on sale related to its commercial real estate activities was due to increased sales of such loans 
capital markets revenues from its securities trading activities consist of gain on sale and interest income 
in a steep yield curve environment  net interest income will comprise a larger percentage of total securities trading revenue 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will naturally shift toward gain on sale of securities 
during the yield curve was flatter than in  which resulted in a shift in trading revenues from interest income to gain on sale 
the decrease in loss on sale of the trading securities was more than offset by a decline in net interest income due to the overall decline in trading margins 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors  including the volume  mix and timing of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition  the level of investor demand for mortgage securities  the slope of the yield curve and the effectiveness of our associated interest rate risk management activities

average interest earning assets in the banking segment increased to billion during  an increase of billion over the year ago period 
offsetting this increase  the net interest margin decreased to during from during the year ago period 
the decrease in net interest income from mortgage banking loans and securities reflects primarily a flattening of the yield curve during as compared to partially offset by an increase in average balance 
the mortgage banking segment loan and securities inventory is primarily financed with borrowings tied to short term indices 
short term interest rates rose while long term mortgage interest rates declined slightly between the year ago period and  reducing the net interest income relating to outstanding balances 
the decline in net interest margin was not offset by an increase in gain on sale due to price competition 
interest expense allocated to the loan servicing sector increased primarily due to an increase in total servicing sector assets combined with an increase in cost of funds 
net interest income from custodial balances increased in the current period due to an increase in the earnings rate on the custodial balances from during to during  resulting from an increase in short term interest rates combined with an increase in average custodial balances of billion or over the year ago period 
we are required to pass through monthly interest to security holders on paid off loans at the underlying security rates  which were substantially higher than the short term rates earned by us on the payoff float 
the amount of such interest passed through to the security holders was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income from the capital markets securities portfolio is attributable to a decrease in the net interest margin from in to  which is partially offset by an increase of in the average inventory of securities held 
the decrease in net interest margin on the securities portfolio is primarily due to a larger increase in short term financing rates versus the increase in rates in the longer term securities held by the capital markets segment 
the decline in net interest income was partially offset by a decrease in loss on sale of securities 
the increase in the provision for loan losses is due to the continuing growth and seasoning of the banking segment s loan portfolio  along with million of estimated losses incurred as a result of hurricane katrina

our servicing agreement with ginnie mae allows us to repurchase loans that are delinquent more than days instead of continuing to advance the delinquent interest to the security holders 
this amount is included in loans held for investment as countrywide has the option of repurchasing the loans from the securities and is required to include such loans on its balance sheets 
however  we do not include these loans in our nonaccrual balances because we have not exercised the option to repurchase the loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased by from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to growth in loans held for investment at countrywide bank 
we expect our allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to increase as a percentage of our portfolio of loans held for investment as such portfolio continues to season 
as our portfolio continues to grow  the impact of seasoning on the allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment will be partially offset by new loans

this income excludes any impairment charges  which are included in recovery impairment of retained interests in the consolidated statement of earnings 
other retained interests include interest only and principal only securities as well as residual interests that arise from the securitization of mortgage loans  particularly nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights we recorded amortization of msrs of  million  or an annual rate of  during as compared to  million  or an annual rate of  during the amortization rate of msrs is dependent on the forecasted prepayment speeds at the beginning of each quarter during the period 
on average  prevailing mortgage rates at the beginning of the quarterly periods during were slightly higher than in in addition  the average of the portfolio note rates was lower over the same period 
as a result  the average forecasted prepayment speeds were lower in the current period 
this resulted in a lower amortization rate for than in the year ago period 
dollar amortization was higher because the msr asset balance was higher during recovery impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses recovery impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses are detailed below years ended december  in thousands recovery impairment of retained interests msrs recovery impairment reduction of msr cost basis through application of hedge accounting change in fair value attributable to hedged risk total recovery impairment of msrs other retained interests servicing hedge losses recorded in earnings total recovery of msrs during resulted from an increase in the estimated fair value of msrs resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the period 
msr impairment in resulted generally from a decrease in the msrs estimated fair value driven by a slight decrease in mortgage rates during the period 
in and we recognized impairment of other retained interests resulting from a decline in the value of such securities 
the collateral underlying certain of these residuals is fixed rate while the pass through rate is floating 
an increase in projected short term interest rates during both periods caused compression of the spread on such residuals  which resulted in a decline in their value 
the servicing hedge generated losses of million and million during and  respectively 
during these losses resulted from increases in long term treasury and swap rates and mortgage rates as well as the decay in option time value 
during the losses primarily resulted from the decay in option time value as long term treasury and swap rates remained substantially unchanged 
net insurance premiums earned the increase in net insurance premiums earned of million was primarily due to an increase in premiums earned on the voluntary homeowners and auto lines of business and in reinsurance premiums earned

compensation expenses increased in most other business segments and corporate areas  reflecting growth in the company 
incremental direct costs associated with the origination of loans are deferred when incurred 
subsequent treatment of these costs is based on whether the loans are held for sale or held for investment

the mortgage banking segment produced pre tax earnings of  million for  a decrease of from in the mortgage banking segment  improved financial performance of our msrs was more than offset by a decline in the profitability of our loan production sector 
although net earnings decreased from prior year  earnings per share for decreased to as a result of an increase in the average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period 
loan production sector pre tax earnings were  million for  a decrease of  million from the prior year 
the decrease in the profitability of the loan production sector resulted from lower prime mortgage loan production and sales combined with a compression in margins  which was caused by generally higher mortgage interest rates  increased borrower demand for lower margin adjustable rate mortgages  greater pricing competition  and  higher loan origination costs 
production sector profitability in was bolstered by increased sales of higher margin nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
the pre tax loss in the loan servicing sector  which incorporates the performance of our msrs and other retained interests  was million  an improvement of million from the year ago period 
the reduced pre tax loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the combined amount of amortization and impairment  net of servicing hedge losses gains  which totaled  million in  compared to  million in the year ago period 
our banking segment increased its pre tax earnings by million from the year ago period  primarily as the result of increases in the balance of mortgage loans held by countrywide bank

the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform at their best when mortgage rates are relatively low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
the natural counterbalance of these sectors reduces the impact of changes in mortgage rates on our earnings 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through the four production divisions of countrywide home loans chl consumer markets  wholesale lending  correspondent lending and full spectrum lending 
full spectrum lending  inc was a subsidiary of cfc until it merged with chl in december mortgage banking loan production volume for decreased in comparison to non purchase loan production declined by  while purchase production increased by 
the increase in purchase loans is significant because this component of the mortgage market offers relatively stable growth  averaging per year over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile because it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage rates 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose non purchase purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate in  of our loan production was adjustable rate in comparison to in the shift in homeowner preferences toward adjustable rate mortgages in was driven by an increase in year fixed mortgage rates  coupled with the availability of attractive product alternatives such as hybrid adjustable rate and short term pay option adjustable rate mortgages that provide a relatively low fixed rate for the first three to ten years of the mortgage 
the volume of mortgage banking prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans produced which is included in our total volume of loans produced increased during the current period from the prior period

our mortgage loan production market share was in  up from in revenues declined over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in production and sales volumes and to decreased margins on prime mortgage loans 
sales of prime mortgage loans were billion in the current period compared to billion in the prior year 
we attribute the decline in margins on prime mortgage loans to increased price competition caused by the significant reduction in refinance activity  as well as to the shift in consumer preference towards adjustable rate mortgages  which generally carry lower margins than year fixed rate mortgages 
the decline in prime mortgage loan revenues was partially offset by increased production and sales of higher margin nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
combined sales of nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loan products were billion in compared to billion in the increase in total revenues as a percentage of loan volume in is attributable to a shift in mix toward nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans  which generally have higher revenues  as a percentage of the loan balance  than prime mortgage loans 
operating expenses increased  both in dollars and in proportion to loan production volume  compared to the prior year 
expenses increased primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs and to a general reduction in productivity from the very high levels achieved during the peak of refinance activity in the increase in sales and marketing costs were related to increased production in of purchase prime mortgage loans  nonprime mortgage loans and prime home equity loans  as well as to an increase in the percentage of total loans produced through our retail channels 
we continued to expand our loans production operations in despite a decline in the overall market to support our long term objective of market share growth 
during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity  compared to during the year ago period 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity with reference to the number of our loan operations personnel multiplied by the number of loans we expect each loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
as loan production volume has declined  there has been a reduction in productivity to more sustainable levels that has resulted in higher overall unit costs 
we plan to continue building our sales staff despite a potential further drop in loan origination volume as a primary means to increase our market share  particularly for purchase loans

the pre tax loss in the loan servicing sector was million during  an improvement of million from the prior year 
during  mortgage rates were generally higher than in  which resulted in lower actual and projected prepayments 
such lower prepayments resulted in lower amortization and impairment 
the combined amounts of amortization and impairment  were  million and  million during and  respectively 
long term treasury and swap rates are the indices that underlie the derivatives that constitute the primary components of the servicing hedge 
there was little change in these rates from december  to december  the servicing hedge loss of million in resulted primarily from time value decay on the options included in the servicing hedge 
during  the servicing hedge generated a gain of million 
this gain resulted from a decline in long term treasury and swap rates during the first part of the servicing hedge gains generated in the early part of were partly offset by servicing hedge losses toward the end of the year as long term treasury and swap rates rose 
in a stable interest rate environment  we would expect to incur no significant impairment charges  however  we would expect to incur losses related to the servicing hedge driven primarily by time decay on options used in the hedge 
the level of such servicing hedge losses depends on various factors such as the size and composition of the hedge  the shape of the yield curve and the level of implied interest rate volatility

we are required to pass through monthly interest to security holders on paid off loans at the underlying security rates  which were substantially higher than the short term rates earned by us on the payoff float 
the amount of such interest passed through to the security holders was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense allocated to the loan servicing sector increased primarily due to an increase in total servicing sector assets 
the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was primarily attributable to growth in the average investment in mortgage loans in the bank 
average assets in the banking segment increased to billion during  an increase of billion over the year ago period 
the average net interest spread earned increased to during from during the decrease in net interest income from the capital markets securities portfolio is attributable to a decrease in the average net spread earned from in to in  partially offset by an increase of in the average inventory of securities held 
the decrease in net spread earned on the securities portfolio is primarily due to an increase in short term financing rates

the resulting excess yield has been securitized and sold or is included on the balance sheet as trading securities 
the decrease in income from other retained interests was due primarily to a slight decrease in the yield on these investments during these investments include interest only and principal only securities as well as residual interests that arise from the securitization of nonconforming mortgage loans  particularly nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights we recorded amortization of msrs of  million  or an annual rate of  during as compared to  million  or an annual rate of  during the reduction in the amortization rate reflects the increase in the estimated life of the servicing portfolio  which is attributable to the effect of comparatively higher interest rates during the current period on estimated future prepayments 
partially offsetting the lower amortization rate was a higher msr asset balance attributable to net growth in the servicing portfolio during impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses gains impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses gains are detailed below years ended december  in thousands impairment of retained interests msrs other retained interests servicing hedge losses gains recorded in earnings impairment of msrs in resulted generally from a decline in their estimated fair value  driven by a slight decrease in mortgage rates during the year 
however  impairment of msrs was lower in than in because mortgage rates were generally higher during than in impairment of msrs during resulted from a reduction in the estimated fair value of msrs  primarily driven by the decline in mortgage rates during much of the period 
in  we recognized impairment of other retained interests  primarily as a result of a decline in the value of nonprime securities 
the collateral underlying certain of these residuals is fixed rate while the pass through rate is floating 
an increase in projected short term interest rates during the current period resulted in a compression of the spread on such residuals  which resulted in a decline in their value 
there was little change in long term treasury and swap rates from december  to december  the servicing hedge loss of million in resulted primarily from time value decay on the options included in the servicing hedge 
during  the servicing hedge generated a gain of million 
this gain resulted from a decline in long term treasury and swap rates during the first part of the servicing hedge gains generated in the early part of were partly offset by servicing hedge losses toward the end of the year as long term treasury and swap rates rose 
the servicing hedge is intended to moderate the effect on earnings caused by changes in the estimated fair value of msrs and other retained interests that generally result from changes in mortgage rates 
rising interest rates in the future will result in servicing hedge losses 
net insurance premiums earned the increase in net insurance premiums earned is due to an increase in premiums earned on lender placed and voluntary lines of business combined with an increase in reinsurance premiums

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk 
the predominant type of interest rate risk at countrywide is price risk  which is the risk that the value of our assets and liabilities will change due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk also includes the risk that the net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios will change in response to changes in interest rates 
from an enterprise perspective  we manage interest rate risk through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing businesses 
we also use various financial instruments  including derivatives  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to the values of our interest rate lock commitments  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs and other retained interests and trading securities  as well as a portion of our debt 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
our corporate asset liability management committee  which is comprised of several of the company s senior financial executives  is responsible for management of this risk 
interest rate lock commitments and mortgage inventory we are exposed to price risk from the time an interest rate lock commitment irlc is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the resulting mortgage loan is sold 
irlcs guarantee for a specified period the rate and points to be charged to a borrower on a mortgage 
the period of the guarantee is generally from seven to days 
during this period  we are exposed to losses if mortgage rates rise  because the increase in interest rates generally causes the value of the irlc or mortgage to decline 
to manage this risk  we use derivatives  primarily forward sales of mbs  options to buy and sell mbs  eurodollar futures and eurodollar options as well as options on treasury futures contracts 
managing the interest rate risk related to irlcs is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the irlc is beyond our control and is driven primarily by changes in mortgage rates in the marketplace 
in general  the percentage of applications that ultimately close within the terms of the irlc increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants committed rates 
the closing percentage is also influenced by the source and age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using empirical data 
our estimates take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
our closing ratio estimates are revised periodically using the most current empirical data 
to manage the price risk associated with irlcs  we use a combination of net forward sales of mbs and put and call options on mbs  treasury futures and eurodollar futures 
we generally enter into forward sales contracts of mbs in an amount equal to the portion of the irlcs expected to close  assuming no change in mortgage rates 
we acquire put and call options to protect against the variability of the rate of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates  using our current closing ratio estimates to determine the amount of optional coverage required 
we manage the price risk related to our mortgage loan inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of mbs and eurodollar futures contracts 
the value of these forward mbs sales and eurodollar futures moves in the opposite direction of the value of the mortgage loan inventory 
we manage the price risk and credit risk related to our commercial mortgage loans using total rate of return and credit default swaps 
we actively manage our irlcs and mortgage loan inventory risk profiles on a daily basis 
a more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use in our risk management activities related to the irlcs and mortgage loan inventory is presented below forward sales of mbs an obligation to sell an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of mbs an obligation to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long call options on mbs a right to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long put options on mbs a right to sell an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates rise 
long call options on treasury futures a right to acquire a treasury futures contract at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long put options on treasury futures a right to sell a treasury futures contract at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as the benchmark treasury rate rises 
short eurodollar futures contracts a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value increases when eurodollar rates rise 
total rate of return swaps an agreement to pay or receive the total return on a financial index or security in exchange for the payment or receipt of a floating rate of interest over the term of the contract 
for use in the risk management of the commercial mortgage portfolio  the company pays the return on a published cmbs index and receives the floating rate of interest 
the value of these contracts increases as the value of the index declines 
credit default swaps an agreement to purchase credit event protection based on a financial index or security in exchange for paying a fixed rate of interest over the term of the contract 
for use in the risk management of the commercial mortgage portfolio  the company receives credit protection and pays a fixed rate of interest 
the value of these contracts increases when the probability of the occurrence of a credit event rises 
mortgage servicing rights msrs and other retained interests our msrs and other retained interests are subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline 
declining mortgage rates generally precipitate increased mortgage refinancing activity 
increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the msrs and other retained interests  thereby reducing their value 
reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings primarily through impairment charges 
to moderate the effect on earnings of impairment  we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivatives  which generally increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
we currently use  or have used in the past  the following financial instruments in our servicing hedge interest rate floors a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate 
the value increases as reference interest rates fall 
the reference interest rates used include mortgage rates  treasury rates and us dollar usd libor 
long treasury futures an agreement to purchase a treasury security at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long call options on treasury and eurodollar futures a right to acquire a treasury or eurodollar futures contract at a specified price in the future

the value increases as the benchmark treasury or eurodollar rate rises 
long call options on mbs a right to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward purchases of mbs an obligation to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates fall 
interest rate swaps a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg  usd libor 
for use in the servicing hedge  we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
such contracts increase in value as rates fall 
receiver swaptions a right to enter a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date where we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
these contracts increase in value as rates fall 
payor swaptions a right to enter a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date  where we pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate 
these contracts increase in value as rates rise 
principal only securities consist of mortgage trust principal only securities and treasury principal only securities 
these securities have been purchased at discounts to par value 
as interest rates decrease  the value of these securities generally increases 
mortgage forward rate agreement a mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date  based on the basis point difference between the forward fixed rate and floating rate set equal to the day forward current coupon mortgage rate  known as the cmm index  on the settlement date 
for use in the servicing hedge  we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
such contracts increase in value as the spread between the current coupon mortgage rate and the swap curve tightens  or when interest rates fall 
these instruments are combined to manage the overall risk profile of the msrs and other retained interests 
we actively manage our retained interests risk profile on a daily basis 
securities trading activities within our capital markets operations  we maintain a trading portfolio of fixed income securities  primarily mbs 
we are exposed to price changes in our trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period we hold the securities 
to manage this risk  we use the following derivative instruments forward sales of to be announced tba mbs an obligation to sell agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specified price and at a specified date in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of tba mbs an obligation to purchase agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specified price at a specified date in the future 
the value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward sale of us treasury securities an agreement to sell a specified quantity of us treasury securities for a specified price at a specified date in the future 
the value increases when interest rates rise

the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates rise 
long futures contract a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to the spot fed funds or eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates fall 
interest rate swaps a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg usd libor 
for use in its trading portfolio risk management activities  the company receives the floating rate and pays the fixed rate 
such contracts increase in value as rates rise 
long put options on futures contracts a right to sell futures contracts  the value of which is tied to spot fed funds or eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates rise 
long call options on futures contracts a right to purchase futures contracts  the value of which is tied to spot fed funds or eurodollar rates at specific future dates 
the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates fall 
countrywide bank the primary component of countrywide bank s earnings is net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios 
at countrywide bank  we invest primarily in adjustable rate and short duration residential mortgages 
our securities portfolio is comprised mostly of short duration sequential collateralized mortgage obligations 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily by investing in relatively short duration assets  and matching the duration and re pricing characteristics of our interest bearing liabilities with those of our interest earning assets 
deposits are priced to encourage consumers to choose maturity terms consistent with our assets 
interest rate swaps are also used to efficiently and cost effectively manage the repricing characteristics of our liabilities to facilitate the liabilities alignment with our interest earning assets 
debt securities we determine the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt as part of our overall interest rate risk management activities 
we use interest rate swaps to efficiently and cost effectively achieve our desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
typically  terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt  resulting in an effective conversion to the desired mix 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment  including selected hypothetical  instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
we employ various commonly used modeling techniques to value our financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses 
for mortgage loans  mbs  mbs forward contracts  collateralized mortgage obligations and msrs  option adjusted spread oas models are used 
the primary assumptions used in these models for purpose of these sensitivity analyses are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
other retained interests are valued using a zero volatility discounted cash flow model 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
all relevant cash flows associated with the financial instruments are incorporated in the models 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical  instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions msrs and other financial instruments msr and other retained interests impact of servicing hedge mortgage based swap based msrs and other retained interests  net interest rate lock commitments mortgage loan inventory impact of associated derivative instruments mortgage based treasury based eurodollar based interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loan inventory  net countrywide bank securities portfolio mortgage loans deposit liabilities federal home loan bank advances countrywide bank  net notes payable and capital securities impact of associated derivative instruments swap based notes payable and capital securities  net insurance company investment portfolios net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities these sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time  only contemplate certain movements in interest rates  do not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility or changes in the relationship of one interest rate index to another  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such scenarios  most significantly the impact of changes in loan production earnings that result from changes in interest rates 
not all of the changes in fair value would affect current period earnings 
for example  msrs are carried by impairment stratum at the lower of amortized cost or market value 
absent hedge accounting  any increase in the value of a particular msr stratum in excess of the related impairment reserve would not be reflected in current period earnings 
the total impairment valuation allowance was billion as of december  on april   we implemented hedge accounting in accordance with sfas for a portion of our interest rate risk management activities related to msrs 
in addition  our debt is carried at its unpaid principal balance net of issuance discount or premium  therefore  absent hedge accounting  changes in the market value of our debt are not recorded in current period earnings 
for these reasons  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
market risk foreign currency risk to diversify our funding sources on a global basis  we occasionally issue medium term notes denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage the foreign currency risk associated with these medium term notes through cross currency swap transactions 
the terms of the cross currency swaps have the effect of converting all foreign currency denominated medium term notes into us dollar obligations  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
credit risk management credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk arises in many of our business activities including lending activities  securities trading activities and interest rate risk management activities 
we actively manage credit risk to maintain credit losses within levels that achieve our profitability and return on capital objectives while meeting our expectations for consistent financial performance 
our credit committee has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve our credit risk goals and objectives 
those goals and objectives are documented in our credit policy 
the committee is comprised of our chief credit officer and other senior executives 
mortgage credit risk overview in our mortgage lending activities  we manage our credit risk through credit policy  underwriting  quality control and surveillance activities as well as through use of credit enhancements  especially nonrecourse and limited recourse securitizations 
we also employ proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts 
loan quality our credit policy establishes standards for the determination of acceptable credit risks 
those standards encompass borrower and collateral quality  underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards and procedures 
borrower quality includes consideration of the borrower s credit and capacity to pay 
we assess credit and capacity to pay through the use of credit scores  application of a mortgage scorecard  and manual or automated underwriting 
collateral quality includes consideration of property value  condition and marketability and is determined through physical inspections and the use of manual and automated valuation models and processes 
underwriting guidelines facilitate the uniform application of underwriting standards to all borrowers regardless of race  religion or ethnic background 
uniformity in underwriting also provides a means for measuring and managing credit risk 
this allows us  as well as government sponsored enterprises gses  private investors  and the secondary markets in general  to assess risk  which provides us with more flexibility in the sale of loans 
our conventional conforming underwriting guidelines are based on the guidelines established by fannie mae or freddie mac 
our underwriting guidelines for fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans comply with guidelines established by the us department of housing and urban development or the veterans administration 
our underwriting guidelines for non conforming mortgage loans  prime home equity loans  and nonprime mortgage loans have been designed so that these loans are salable in the secondary mortgage market 
we developed these guidelines to meet the requirements of private investors  rating agencies and third party credit enhancement providers 
these standards and procedures encompass underwriter qualifications and authority levels  appraisal review requirements  fraud controls  funds disbursement controls  training of our employees and ongoing review of their work 
we help to ensure that our origination standards are met by employing accomplished and seasoned management  underwriters and processors and through the extensive use of technology 
we also employ proprietary underwriting systems in our loan origination process that improve the consistency of underwriting standards  assess collateral adequacy and help to prevent fraud  while at the same time increasing productivity 
we supplement our loan origination standards and procedures with a post funding quality control process 
our quality control department  under the direction of the chief credit officer  is responsible for completing loan audits that may consist of a re verification of loan documentation  an underwriting and appraisal review  and if necessary  a fraud investigation 
we also employ a pre and post funding proprietary loan performance evaluation system 
this system helps to identify fraud and poor performance of individuals and business entities associated with the origination of our loans 
the combination of this system and our audit results allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to prescribed underwriting guidelines and compliance with laws and regulations 
sale of loans nearly all of the mortgage loans that we originate in our mortgage banking segment are sold into the secondary mortgage market primarily in the form of securities  and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
while we generally sell our prime mortgage loans on a non recourse basis  either in the form of securities or whole loans  we have potential liability under the representations and warranties we make to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties  we may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer 
in such cases  we bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans 
the liability for this recourse totaled million at december  and million at december  securitization as described below  the degree to which we retain credit risk on loans that we sell through securitizations depends on the structure of the securitization 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
conforming conventional loans we generally pool conforming conventional loans into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
subject to certain representations and warranties we make  nearly all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold on a non recourse basis 
we pay guarantee fees to these agencies to compensate them for their assumption of credit risk on the securitized loans 
fha insured and va guaranteed loans fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
we are insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
fees charged by the fha and va for assuming such risks are paid directly by the borrower 
we are exposed to credit losses on defaulted va loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
we pay guarantee fees to ginnie mae for ginnie mae s guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest 
ginnie mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program 
non conforming conventional prime loans non conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label non agency mortgage backed securities 
such securitizations involve some form of credit enhancement  such as senior subordinated structures  overcollateralization or mortgage pool insurance 
securitizations that involve senior subordinated structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk 
holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield 
we generally sell the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations and thereby transfer the related credit risk subject to representations and warranties we make when the loans are securitized 
prime home equity loans prime home equity loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
these securities generally are credit enhanced through over collateralization  residual interests that we generally retain and guarantees provided by a third party surety 
in some cases  the securitizations also contain mortgage pool insurance or a limited corporate guarantee as a form of credit enhancement 
in prime home equity securitizations  countrywide is generally in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of a residual interest 
nonprime mortgage loans nonprime mortgage loans generally are pooled into private label asset backed securities 
we generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit losses through retention of residual interests  the value of which usually range from to of the principal balance of the loans 
the holder of the residual interest is in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual interest 
in some cases  such limited recourse securitizations have contained lender paid mortgage insurance as a form of credit enhancement or a limited corporate guarantee from us 
we also have pooled a portion of our nonprime mortgage loans into securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
in such cases  we have paid fannie mae a guarantee fee in exchange for fannie mae assuming the credit risk of the underlying loans 
in some cases the retained residual interest is deposited into a net interest margin security  which enables us to monetize future residual cash flows and retain a smaller residual interest back end nim residual 
the value of the back end nim residuals usually range from to of the principal balance of the loans underlying the residual security 
the holder of the back end nim residual is in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the back end nim residual 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
these amounts at december  are as follows december  in thousands subordinated interests prime home equity residual securities nonprime residual securities prime home equity line of credit transferor s interests nonconforming residual securities subordinated mortgage backed pass through securities corporate guarantees in excess of recorded liability the carrying value of the residual securities is net of expected future credit losses 
the total credit losses incurred for and related to all of our mortgage securitization activities are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands nonprime securitizations with retained residual interest prime home equity securitizations with retained residual interest repurchased or indemnified loans prime home equity securitizations with corporate guarantee nonprime securitizations with corporate guarantee va losses in excess of va guarantee portfolio lending activities as discussed in the preceding section  detailed line item discussion of consolidated revenue and expense items net interest income  we have a portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment  consisting primarily of prime mortgage and prime home equity loans  which amounted to billion at december  this portfolio is held primarily in our bank 
billion of prime home equity loans held in the bank with combined loan to value ratios equal to or above are covered by a pool insurance policy that provides partial protection against credit losses 
otherwise  we generally retain full credit exposure on these loans 
we also provide short term secured mortgage loan warehouse advances to various lending institutions  which totaled billion at december  we incurred no credit losses related to this activity during the year ended december  mortgage reinsurance we provide mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans included in our servicing portfolio through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  we absorb mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a cap  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
as of december   approximately billion of mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance contracts place limits on our maximum exposure to losses 
at december   the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts was limited to million 
we are required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability 
we recorded provisions for losses related to this activity of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
the accumulated liability recorded for estimated reinsurance totaled million at december  mortgage loans held for sale at december   mortgage loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory  we bear credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance which is generally required for conventional loans with a loan to value ratio greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
historically  credit losses related to loans held for sale have not been significant 
counterparty credit risk we have exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non performance by our trading counterparties and counterparties to our various over the counter derivative financial instruments 
we manage this credit risk by selecting only counterparties we believe to be financially strong  spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties and by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty 
the aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure after consideration of relevant netting agreements at december   before and after collateral held by us  was as follows december  in millions aggregate credit exposure before collateral held less collateral held net aggregate unsecured credit exposure for the year ended december   we incurred no credit losses due to non performance of any of our counterparties 
operational risk all businesses face operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems or from external events 
cfc categorizes operational risk into the areas of human resources  vendor management  custody of assets  accounting and financial disclosure  technology  physical security  natural hazard and environment  fraud and embezzlement internal and external  political governmental affairs  modeling  compliance regulatory  governance  strategic  and reputation 
cfc has documented its operational risks and corresponding controls in its proprietary risk assessment system 
this information is utilized by executive officers and appropriate groups within the company for ongoing risk monitoring  testing and review 
responsibility for operational risk identification and management is assigned to each of our business units with centralized corporate oversight and support 
we further integrate operational risk management into our daily activities 
examples include identification of operational risk is performed at the activity level 
key controls that address the risks are identified and monitored by management 
operational controls that affect financial reporting are also tested by business unit management independent testing of internal controls is conducted on a sample basis by our internal audit function independent review of corporate processes and operational risks including the sufficiency of governance structures to mitigate those risks is conducted by an independent enterprise risk assessment function staff is dedicated to areas of key operational risk  such as a disaster recovery function oversight of operational risk on an enterprise wide basis is conducted by countrywide s executive risk committee  an operational risk committee comprised of senior cfc executives  a risk managers roundtable comprised of divisional operation risk managers  and business unit risk committees comprised of the business unit s leaders and risk managers committees of executive management oversee operational areas that present the greatest operational risk 
these areas include mortgage loan pricing  hedging of mortgage servicing rights  credit policy development  and asset liability management the processes supporting our key business activities are evaluated and redesigned in a structured manner that minimizes errors and inefficiency a corporate expectation of ethical behavior is set with a formalized code of ethics  mandatory annual compliance training  provision for anonymous reporting of suspected breaches of corporate ethics  and independent monitoring and reporting of alleged breaches of corporate ethics to the audit and ethics committee of the board of directors

expressed as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced  excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their non performing status 
we attribute the overall increase in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio primarily to the relative increase in the number of loans in the nonprime portfolio  as well as an increase in average seasoning of these portfolios  which carry higher delinquency rates than conventional and prime home equity mortgage loans 
loans in the hurricane affected areas contributed basis points to the overall delinquency rate 
we believe the delinquency rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with industry experience for similar mortgage loan portfolios 
inflation our operations that would be most significantly impacted by an increase in inflation are our mortgage banking and capital markets operations 
interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  mortgage loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancing 
an environment of gradual interest rate increases may  however  signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values  which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity 
generally  in such periods of reduced mortgage loan production the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs  thus further reducing our loan production earnings 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  our loan servicing earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of our servicing portfolio and thus reducing the amortization and impairment of our msrs 
within our broker dealer operations  rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in trading and underwriting activities in its primary niche  the mortgage securities market 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these seasonal trends reflect the pattern in the national housing market 
home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons 
seasonality has less of an effect on mortgage refinancing activity  which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates 
in addition  mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months  driven by mortgagor payment patterns 
liquidity and capital resources we have significant short term and long term financing needs 
our short term financing needs arise primarily from the warehousing of mortgage loans pending sale and the trading activities of our broker dealer 
our long term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in our mortgage loan portfolio  msrs and other retained interests  along with the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments 
our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
we also have billion outstanding in junior subordinated debentures that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  bank lenders and regulators 
we currently have a billion deferred tax liability related to our msrs that would offset a portion of any potential loss in the value of our msrs and which  to that extent  can be offset against our msrs in determining our capital requirements 
from time to time  we may issue common stock or other high equity content securities as a means of increasing our capital base and supporting our growth 
how we meet our financing needs is influenced by regulatory agency and public debt rating agency requirements 
these requirements influence the nature of what we are able to obtain and the rate at which we are able to grow 
as discussed in the following paragraphs  we meet our financing needs in a variety of ways  through the public corporate debt and equity markets  as well as the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and through the deposit gathering and other financing activities of our bank 
liquidity management the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate reliable sources of cash are available to meet our potential near term funding needs  including periods of stress within the financial markets 
we manage our liquidity by financing our assets in a manner consistent with their liquidity profile 
assets that are considered illiquid are financed with long term capital equity and debt with a final maturity greater than six months 
we manage our long term debt maturities which we define for this purpose as debt maturing after six months  and credit facility expirations to minimize refinancing risk 
we also manage the timing of our short term debt maturities to limit the amount maturing on any given day 
we diversify our financing programs  credit providers and debt investors and dealers to reduce reliance upon any one source of liquidity 
finally  we assess all sources of financing based upon their reliability  recognizing that certain financing programs are sensitive to temporary market disruptions 
we also pay commitment fees to certain creditors to ensure the reliability of certain funds 
we regularly forecast our potential funding needs over three month and longer horizons  taking into account debt maturities and potential peak balance sheet levels 
we establish available reliable sources of liquidity sized to meet potential future funding requirements 
we currently have billion in available sources of short term liquidity  including secured and unsecured committed bank lines of credit and reusable mortgage purchase commitments totaling billion 
our long term debt typically consists of unsecured debt issued in the public corporate debt markets 
at december   we had billion in unsecured long term debt outstanding 
see note notes payable in the financial statement section of this report for additional descriptions of our committed financing programs 
public corporate debt markets the public corporate debt markets are a key source of financing for us  due to their efficiency and low cost 
typically  we access these markets by issuing unsecured commercial paper and medium term notes 
we also have issued unsecured subordinated debt  convertible debt and trust preferred securities 
at december   we had a total of billion in public corporate debt outstanding 
to maintain our desired level of access to the public corporate debt markets  it is critical for us to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
we have consistently maintained solid investment grade credit ratings over the past years 
given our current ratings  we generally have deep access to the public corporate debt markets 
current credit ratings are as follows countrywide home loans countrywide financial corporation rating agency short term long term short term long term standard poors a a a a moody s investors service p a p a fitch f a f a among other things  maintenance of our current investment grade ratings requires that we have high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand by lines of credit  as well as a conservative capital structure 
issues of concern to one or more credit rating agencies in the past have included our significant investment in msrs and other retained interests  our involvement in nonprime lending  as well as our liquidity and capital structure 
we maintain an active dialogue with all three rating agencies  meeting throughout the year to review operational and financial performance and to address specific areas of focus 
in the unlikely event our credit ratings were to drop below investment grade  our access to the public corporate debt markets could be severely limited 
the cutoff for investment grade is generally considered to be a long term rating of bbb  or three gradations below our lowest current rating 
in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade  we could be required to rely upon alternative sources of financing  such as bank lines and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  we would likely be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  our cost of financing would rise significantly and we could have to curtail some of our capital intensive activities  such as our ongoing investment in our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment and msrs and other retained interests 
on the other hand  given the highly liquid nature of our mortgage inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio  we would likely be able to arrange secured financing for such assets 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for us to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
management believes the likelihood of a reduction in our credit ratings to below investment grade in the foreseeable future is remote 
we analyze contingent liquidity scenarios of varying duration and severity for our mortgage company  bank and broker dealer to ensure that sufficient highly reliable sources of committed liquidity are in place and available to finance the company during a temporary market disruption 
asset backed financing market a growing source of funding for us is the asset backed financing market 
this form of financing generally involves the temporary transfer of legal ownership of assets to a separate legal entity conduit in exchange for short term financing 
such financing programs generally have commercial bank sponsors that provide some form of credit enhancement to the program  for example  back up lines of credit or market value swaps 
investors that purchase secured debt  typically commercial paper  issued by these conduits look primarily to the asset value to ensure repayment  rather than to the credit standing of the company that utilizes the conduit for financing 
we have used this market primarily to finance a significant portion of our mortgage loan inventory 
due to its liquid nature and short holding period  our mortgage loan inventory has been well received by asset backed commercial paper investors 
we use such programs as a cost effective means to expand and diversify our sources of liquidity 
at december   we had borrowed a total of billion through such asset backed financing programs 
secondary mortgage market we rely substantially on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long term capital to support our mortgage banking operations 
most of the mortgage loans that we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs 
significant portions of the mbs we sell are guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae collectively  agency mbs 
we also issue non agency or private label mbs and abs 
private label mbs and abs are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
private label mbs and abs generally require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior subordinated structures  primary mortgage insurance  countrywide guarantees and or private surety guarantees 
the agency mbs market is extremely liquid 
the private label mbs and abs market  particularly the nonprime abs market  is significantly less liquid  although we have enjoyed essentially uninterrupted access to these markets  albeit at varying costs 
we ensure our ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
as described elsewhere in this document  we have a major focus on ensuring the quality of our mortgage loan production and we make significant investments in personnel and technology to support the quality of our mortgage loan production 
repurchase agreements we also utilize short term repurchase agreements as a primary means of financing securities and mortgage loans pending sale 
although this method of financing is uncommitted and short term in nature  it has proven to be a reliable and cost effective financing alternative for us 
regulatory capital requirements we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the board of governors of the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the office of comptroller of the currency 
the capital adequacy guidelines require us to maintain specific capital levels based on our assets and off balance sheet items 
our policy is to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels that are above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal reserve board 
at december  and  the company and the bank s regulatory capital ratios and amounts and minimum required capital ratios for the company and the bank to maintain a well capitalized status were as follows december  minimum countrywide financial corporation countrywide bank required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
december  minimum countrywide financial corporation countrywide bank required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
while the bank has not historically been a source of cash to the parent company  the capital regulations also limit the bank s ability to transfer funds to the parent company 
as of december   billion of the bank s retained earnings were available for payment of dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval 
at december   the bank s retained earnings unavailable for dividends totaled million 
cash flow cash flow used by operating activities was billion for  compared to billion for cash flow used in operating activities includes the cash used for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale and the proceeds from the sales of such mortgages 
we generally retain servicing rights and may retain other interests when these loans are sold 
the transfer of the amounts retained is a non cash investing activity 
see note supplemental cash flow information in the financial statement section of this report 
the increase in net cash flow used by operations for compared to was primarily due to an increase in the mortgage loan inventory of billion in compared to an increase in mortgage loan inventory of billion in and a billion net increase in cash used to settle trading securities sold not yet purchased  at fair value 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for  compared to billion for the increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to a billion increase in cash used to fund loans held for investment  combined with a billion increase in cash used to fund investments in other financial instruments and a billion increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed and federal funds sold 
net cash provided by financing activities for totaled billion  compared to billion for the increase in cash provided by financing activities was comprised of a billion net increase in short term borrowings  including securities sold under agreements to repurchase  an billion net increase in bank deposit liabilities and a billion increase in long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees in the ordinary course of our business we engage in financial transactions that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement section of this report for a description of our consolidation policy 
such transactions are structured to manage our interest rate  credit or liquidity risks  to diversify funding sources or to optimize our capital 
substantially all of our off balance sheet arrangements relate to the securitization of mortgage loans 
our mortgage loan securitizations are normally structured as sales as specified by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  and as such involve the transfer of the mortgage loans to qualifying special purpose entities that are not subject to consolidation 
in a securitization  an entity transferring the assets is able to convert those assets into cash 
special purpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash to acquire the assets by issuing securities to investors 
in a securitization  we customarily provide representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans transferred 
in addition  we generally retain the right to service the transferred mortgage loans 
we also generally have the right to repurchase mortgage loans from the special purpose entity if the remaining outstanding balance of the mortgage loans falls to a level where the cost of servicing the loans becomes burdensome in relation to the benefits of servicing 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
during  we securitized billion in nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
for a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk  see the section in this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk 
we do not believe that any of our off balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the sales proceeds and cash flows from our securitizations for and additional information with respect to securitization activities are included in the financial statements section of this report note loan sales 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   with the exception of short term borrowing arrangements and pension and post retirement benefit plans 
note less than year years years more than years total in thousands obligations notes payable time deposits operating leases purchase obligations see respective notes to the financial statements included in this report 
as of december   the company had undisbursed home equity lines of credit and construction loan commitments of billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans totaled billion  outstanding commitments to sell mortgage loans totaled billion and outstanding commitments to buy mortgage loans totaled billion 
in connection with the company s underwriting activities  the company had commitments to purchase and sell new issues of securities aggregating million at december  prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of 
we believe that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the ongoing developments in the mortgage market that should fuel its growth include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth in nonprime lending  the growth of prime home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
in recent years  the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market and demand by borrowers has resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products  greater regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization  and interest rate volatility has risen over the last decade 
at the same time  homeowners propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has become more efficient and cost effective 
the combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year 
these volume swings have placed significant operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders 
to compete effectively in this environment  mortgage lenders must have a very high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise 
in addition  the residential mortgage business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical 
primarily because of these factors  the industry has undergone consolidation 
today  large  sophisticated financial institutions dominate the residential mortgage industry 
these industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
today  the top mortgage lenders combined have a share of the mortgage origination market  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of loan volume for the top five originators  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution in billions countrywide wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual chase home finance bank of america mortgage total for top five this consolidation trend has naturally carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business 
today  the top mortgage servicers combined have a share of the total mortgages outstanding  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of loan volume for the top five servicers  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution in billions countrywide wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual chase home finance citimortgage corp total for top five we believe the consolidation trend will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
we believe countrywide will benefit from this trend through increased market share and ability to recruit talented personnel 
compared to countrywide  the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for adjustable rate mortgages  due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
this could place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future if the demand for adjustable rate mortgages continues  the secondary mortgage market does not continue to provide a competitive outlet for these loans  or we are unable to sustain an adequate portfolio lending capacity 
housing appreciation housing values affect us in several positive ways rising housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing  increased average loan balances  and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults 
however  as housing values appreciate  prepayments of existing mortgages tend to increase as mortgagors look to monetize the additional equity in their homes 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index and growth in personal income 
consequently  we expect housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming years than in the past several years 
although there may be some markets that experience housing price depreciation  we believe that price depreciation will not occur nationwide 
over the long term  we expect that housing appreciation will be positively correlated with both consumer price inflation and growth in personal income 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which we operate have an impact on the activities in which we may engage  how the activities may be carried out and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent we are able to operate profitably 
for example  proposed local  state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories 
this could result in a reduction of otherwise legitimate nonprime lending opportunities 
in addition  there may be future local  state and federal legislation that restricts our ability to communicate with and solicit business from current and prospective customers in such a way that we are not able to originate new loans or sell other products in as profitable a manner 
mortgage originations following is the estimated total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years calendar year united states mortgage originations in billions source mortgage bankers association forecasters currently put the market for at between trillion and trillion 
the forecasted reduction is attributable to an expected decline in mortgage refinance activity 
we believe that a market within the forecasted range would still be favorable for our loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to have some impact on its profitability 
this forecast would imply declining pressure on our loan servicing business due to a reduction in mortgage loan prepayment activity 
in our capital markets segment business  such a drop in mortgage originations would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume  which would have a negative impact on profitability 
implementation of new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r is focused primarily on accounting for share based compensation 
this statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas r requires measurement of fair value of employee stock options using an option pricing model that takes into account the awarded options unique characteristics 
sfas r requires charging the recognized cost to expense over the period the employee provides services to earn the award  generally the vesting period for the award 
sfas r s measurement requirements for employee stock options are similar to those of sfas  which is the basis for the pro forma stock based compensation disclosure in note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement section of this report 
however  sfas r requires initial and ongoing estimates of the amount of shares that will vest sfas provided entities the option of assuming that all shares would vest and then truing up compensation cost and expense as shares were forfeited adjusting the cost of a modified award with reference to the difference in the fair value of the modified award to the initial award at the date of modification of the award 
sfas r also provides for the use of alternative models to determine compensation cost related to stock option grants 
the model the company will use to value its employee stock options is a variant of the black scholes merton option pricing model
