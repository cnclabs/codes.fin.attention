ethyol life sciences is an agent that reduces certain side effects of chemotherapy  and is licensed by southern research institute sri  exclusively to medimmune  inc formerly us bioscience  us pursuant to an agreement between ctt and sri  sri pays us up to a maximum of  per calendar year from ethyol license income it receives 
since calendar we have received the maximum revenue each calendar year 
this patent expires in december gallium arsenide electronics is used to improve semiconductor operating characteristics 
us patents were issued from march to may patents expired starting in may and the last patent expired in september after september  we will not receive any significant future royalties for this technology 
the current year revenue related to our sexual dysfunction life sciences technology was due to the receipt of an annual minimum license fee 
the minimum fee is due until such time as the technology is commercialized  whereupon royalties will be due if higher than the minimum 
the increase in revenues in was due to a settlement with palatin technologies  inc palatin  our licensee  related to a certain fees received by palatin in pursuant to our license  we are entitled to a portion of fees palatin receives 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
this technology consists of a therapeutic drug to treat male and female sexual dysfunction which is undergoing testing prior to approval 
final approval  assuming testing is successful  is still several years away 
we also earn revenues from royalty legal awards 
such awards may be significant  generally are non recurring and the result of successful patent enforcement actions  and may include punitive damages  attorneys fees  court costs and interest 
out of court settlements may occur prior to or during trials 
revenues from out of court settlements usually are included in retained royalties

retained royalties from foreign sources we have developed relationships with asian companies seeking technology solutions 
retained royalties received from foreign licensees totaled approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
of the foreign sourced royalties received    and  in  and  respectively  were from japanese licenses 
investments from time to time in the past  in addition to providing other forms of assistance  we have funded certain development stage companies to exploit specific technologies 
employees as of october   we employed people full time equivalents 
we also employ independent consultants who provide us with business development services under contracts with us 
in addition to the diverse technical  intellectual property  legal  financial  marketing and business expertise of our professional team  from time to time we rely on advice from outside technical and professional specialists to satisfy our clients and customers unique technology needs

item a 
risk factors the risk factors described below are not all inclusive 
all of these risk factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our results  operations  financial position  strategies and trends 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement or risk factor 
additionally  there may be other risks and uncertainties that we have not highlighted herein that may become material factors affecting our operations and business success 
we derived more than of our retained royalties in fiscal from four technologies 
we derived approximately  or  of retained royalties from four technologies  or  from the homocysteine assay   or  from ethyol   or  from gallium arsenide patents  and  or  from sexual dysfunction patents 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our retained royalties from the same four technologies 
our us patent that covers the homocysteine assay expires in july  and we will not receive significant revenues from this technology after that date 
our retained royalties from ethyol are limited to a maximum of  per calendar year  and since calendar we have received the maximum 
we expect ethyol retained royalties to continue at their level for several years this patent expires in december 
in september  the last of the gallium arsenide patents expired and we will not receive significant royalty revenue after that date 
for the impact of expiring licenses  see below 
such a concentration of revenues makes our operations vulnerable to changes in and or patent expiration of any one of them  especially the homocysteine assay  and such changes could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position 
page 
table of contents certain of our licensed patents have recently expired or will expire in the near future and we may not be able to replace their royalty revenues 
in  we derived retained royalties from licenses on twenty two patented technologies 
we expect royalties from eleven of those patented technologies to expire in the next five years 
those patented technologies represented approximately of our retained royalties in fiscal retained royalties of approximately  or   or  and  or  respectively  were from patents expiring in fiscal  and the loss of these royalties  especially the homocysteine assay  will materially  adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to replace them with revenues from other licenses or other sources 
since it often takes two or more years for a technology to produce significant revenues  we must continuously seek new sources of future revenues 
in three of the last five fiscal years  we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows  and our ability to finance future losses is limited  and may involve significant dilution to existing stockholders 
the table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended july  net income loss net cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the recurring revenue stream we have currently is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure 
in and  we were profitable because of large  upfront license fees received related to our homocysteine technology  the magnitude of which was unusually high and did not recur in  and infrequently occurring revenues  including legal awards and dividends 
without these revenues  we would have incurred a loss in both years  and for all of the five years ended july  to return to and sustain profitability  we must increase recurring revenues by successfully licensing technologies with current and long term revenue streams  and we must continually add new such licenses 
in addition  we must control our costs  including litigation related costs 
without such actions  our current cash position will deteriorate 
our future royalty revenues  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  enforcing intellectual property rights  and profits or losses are subject to many factors outside our control  or that we currently cannot anticipate  including technological changes and developments  economic cycles  and the ability of our licensees to commercialize our technologies successfully 
consequently  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
although we cannot be assured that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe that our new business plan initiated in  and our capital resources will sustain us at least through fiscal we have no outstanding debt or available credit facility  and we believe that it would be very difficult to obtain any form of debt financing due to the current composition of our balance sheet  and page 
table of contents unpredictable nature of our annual cash flows 
thus  our financing options currently are limited  and we must rely on cash on hand and cash flows  if any  from operations  though this situation could change in the future 
we did obtain equity financing in which we completed in we continue to review financing options for our business  which may in the future include more equity financing 
if we do enter into an equity financing arrangement in the future  and if we do sell shares of our common stock pursuant to such financing to raise cash to operate the business  then existing holders of our common stock may suffer significant dilution to their equity position 
we depend on our relationships with inventors to gain access to new technologies and inventions 
if we fail to maintain existing relationships or to develop new relationships  we may have fewer technologies and inventions available to generate revenues 
in addition  technology can change rapidly and industry standards are continually evolving 
this often makes products obsolete  or results in short product lifecycles 
our profitability also depends on our licensees ability to adapt to such changes 
we do not invent new technologies or products ourselves 
we depend on relationships with universities  corporations  governmental agencies  research institutions  inventors  and others to provide us with technology based opportunities that we can develop into profitable royalty bearing licenses 
our failure to maintain these relationships or to develop new relationships could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to forge new relationships or to maintain our current relationships  we may be unable to identify new technology based opportunities and royalty bearing licenses 
we also are dependent on our clients abilities to develop new technologies  introduce new products  and adapt to changes in technology and economic needs 
further  we cannot be certain that our current or any new relationships will provide the volume or quality of available new technologies necessary to sustain our business 
in some cases  universities and other sources of new technologies may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize these technologies themselves  or through entities that they develop  finance and or control 
in other cases  universities receive financing for basic research from companies in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize any resulting inventions 
these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources potential clients to whom we can market our services 
if we are unable to secure new sources of technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we receive most of our revenues from customers over whom we have no control 
we rely on royalties received from our customers for revenues 
the royalties we receive from our customers depend on their efforts and expenditures and we have no control over their efforts or expenditures 
additionally  our customers development of new products involves great risk since many new technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts 
our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they may encounter in attempting to develop commercial products and they usually treat such information as confidential 
we expect that our customers will encounter problems frequently 
our customers failure to resolve such problems may result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
strong competition within our industry may reduce our client base 
we compete with universities  law firms  venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms for technology licensing opportunities 
many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services  and some are well established and have more financial and human resources than we do 
this market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area

table of contents a former president and chief executive officer and ctt have been named in a civil suit filed by the sec 
until this matter is resolved  our stock price may be adversely impacted  and our operations and expenses may be negatively affected 
on august   the sec filed a civil suit naming competitive technologies  inc  our former president and chief executive officer ceo from  and six individual brokers in the united states district court for the district of connecticut  alleging that from at least july to june  ctt was involved in a scheme to manipulate the price of our stock 
the case relates to our stock repurchase program under which we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time during the period from october  to march  ctt was named as a defendant in the suit due to the alleged conduct of our former ceo  whose conduct in connection with the stock repurchase program was imputed to ctt as a matter of law 
relating to ctt  the sec in the suit seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting us from further violations of the securities exchange act of and a civil penalty pursuant to section d of the securities exchange act of this section provides for maximum penalties of  for a corporate entity and  per individual 
on september   we responded to this civil suit  and filed a motion to dismiss the suit 
on october   the sec filed a motion opposing our motion to dismiss the suit  and on july   our motion to dismiss the suit was denied 
on april   we filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss the case 
on june   the sec filed a motion to oppose our motion for summary judgment 
further action in this case is pending 
if our motion for summary judgement is not successful  we expect that the case will go to trial sometime in defense costs incurred since august relating to this suit are being covered by our directors and officers insurance carrier  however  we cannot be certain that all future costs  including potential fines and penalties  will be covered by our insurance carrier 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
until this matter is resolved  our stock price may be adversely impacted  and our operations and expenses may be negatively affected 
our by laws provide that we will indemnify our directors  officers  employees and agents in certain circumstances 
we carry directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles to reduce these financial obligations 
our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the civil suit filed by the sec see item legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
we are currently involved in lawsuits that historically have involved significant legal expenses 
in addition  our most recent former president and ceo filed a complaint against us seeking certain damages  and we have filed a complaint against him for monetary and punitive damages 
if the courts or regulatory agencies in these suits or actions decide against us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  legal fees and other costs we incurred in relating to these cases were significant  and the amount of costs we incur in the future may be significant 
for a complete description of all of the lawsuits we are involved in  see item legal proceedings 
page 
table of contents two of our officers have demanded a significant amount of additional compensation from us 
on september   we received a demand letter from an attorney representing two of our officers neither of whom is our chief executive  operating or financial officer  demanding approximately  in total for commission payments alleged to be due them for under our prior annual incentive compensation plan  which was terminated in november these individuals received commission payments in related to new homocysteine licenses granted in  and are claiming that the company is obligated  and they were promised that the payments would continue for a period of two years thereafter 
it also is claimed in the letter that these individuals anticipate that they would be entitled to at least an aggregate additional  in commission payments in we are investigating this matter  but expect to vigorously defend any litigation that may arise from it 
pending completion of the investigation  we have put these individuals on administrative leave with pay 
we cannot estimate the amount of costs we may incur relating to this matter  but the costs may be significant  although a portion of the costs may be covered by insurance 
our revenue growth depends on our ability to understand the technology requirements of our customers in the context of their markets 
if we fail to understand their technology needs or markets  we limit our ability to meet those needs and to generate revenues 
we believe that by focusing on the technology needs of our customers  we are better positioned to generate revenues by providing technology solutions to them 
in this way  the market demands of our customers drive our revenues 
the better we understand their markets and requirements  the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers technical  commercial  and market requirements and constraints  and to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the knowledge  efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel

freed is our president and chief executive officer  michael e 
kiley is our senior vice president and chief operating officer  and michael d 
davidson is our senior vice president and chief financial officer 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions  and to negotiate and close license agreements 
competition for personnel with the necessary breadth and depth of experience is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants  especially with our small number of staff  our revenues  prospects  financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected 
our customers  and therefore we  depend on receiving government approvals to exploit certain licensed products commercially 
commercial exploitation of some licensed patents may require the approval of governmental regulatory agencies  especially in the life sciences area  and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals 
in the united states  the principal governmental agency involved is the us food and drug administration fda 
the fda s approval process is rigorous  time consuming and costly 
unless and until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval  the licensee may not sell the product in the us  and therefore we will not receive royalty income based on us sales of the product 
page 
table of contents if our clients and we are unable to protect the intellectual property underlying our licenses  or to enforce our patents adequately  we may be unable to exploit such licensed patents or technologies successfully 
our success in earning revenues from licenses is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid  that patents may not issue on patent applications  or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents and thereby render our licensed patents not commercially viable 
in addition  when all patents underlying a license expire  our royalties from that license cease  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace those royalties with royalty revenues from new or other licenses 
patent litigation has increased  it can be expensive and may delay or prevent our customers products from entering the market 
our clients and or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against sellers of products that we believe infringe our patent rights 
holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products also may challenge our patents in patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings 
for a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
we cannot assure you that our clients and or we will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding  and the results and costs of such litigation or proceeding may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
developing new products  creating effective commercialization strategies for technologies  and enhancing those products and strategies are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include unanticipated delays  unrecoverable expenses  technical problems or difficulties  and the possibility that development funds will be insufficient 
the occurrence of any one or more of these risks could make us abandon or substantially change our technology commercialization strategy 
our success depends on  among other factors  our clients developing new or improved technologies  our customers products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large scale production  and our customers ability to adapt technologies to satisfy industry standards  satisfy consumer expectations and needs  and bring their products to market before the market is saturated 
they may encounter unanticipated technical or other problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in introducing and marketing new products 
current and future products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions or otherwise commercially viable and competitive 
new products may not satisfy price or other performance objectives when introduced in the marketplace 
any of these events would adversely affect our realization of royalties from such new products 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since  and  our board of directors currently does not have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future 
however  the decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our board of directors based upon factors that they deem relevant  and may change at any time 
as a publicly held company  we have significantly higher administrative costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and new listing requirements subsequently adopted by the american stock exchange in response to the sarbanes oxley act of  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements have increased our legal  audit  financial  compliance and administrative costs  and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly 
the additional costs are expected to continue 
in addition  these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for page 
table of contents us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance in the future  and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
item b 
unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties our executive office is approximately  square feet of leased space in an office building in fairfield  connecticut  to which we moved on august  under the terms of a seven year lease signed april   and as subsequently amended  the commencement date the date at which we are responsible for paying rent of the lease was september   and the lease expires september  we have an option to terminate the lease after five years upon making a small payment  and we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years on similar terms and conditions 
the lease also provides for an average over the life of the lease annual base rent of approximately  after incentives  but exclusive of taxes  climate control  power and maintenance 
the lease for our prior executive office expires december   but we are not responsible for rent payments after september   due to an incentive reached with our new landlord and a change in the prior lease whereby we were released from a portion of the lease in exchange for vacating the space prior to september  we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current and near term operations 
item legal proceedings fujitsu in december  coincident with filing a complaint with the united states international trade commission itc that was withdrawn in the university of illinois and ctt filed a complaint against fujitsu limited  fujitsu general limited  fujitsu general america  fujitsu microelectronics  inc and fujitsu hitachi plasma display ltd 
fujitsu et al  collectively  fujitsu in the united states district court for the central district of illinois  seeking damages for past infringements and an injunction against future sales of plasma display panels alleged to infringe two us patents held by our client  the university of illinois 
the two patents cover energy recovery technology for flat plasma display panels 
in may  the central district court of illinois granted fujitsu s motion to transfer this case to the northern district of california 
in september  fujitsu filed counterclaims against us and the university of illinois in the united states district court for the district of delaware which subsequently were dismissed and reinstituted in the northern district of california 
the counterclaims alleged  among other things  that we had misappropriated confidential information and trade secrets supplied by fujitsu  and committed unfair competition in litigating the itc action 
effective july   the university of illinois agreed to take the lead in this litigation and assume the cost of new lead counsel 
before this agreement  we bore the entire cost of lead counsel in this litigation 
in late  we were dismissed as co plaintiff from this litigation  but we retained our economic interest in any potential favorable outcome

carolina liquid was served on september  subsequently  we amended our complaint to add as defendants catch  inc catch and the diazyme laboratories division of general atomics diazyme 
on september   diazyme filed for declaratory judgment in the southern district of california for a change in venue and a declaration of non infringement and invalidity 
on september   the district court in colorado ruled that both catch and diazyme be added as defendants to the carolina liquid case

palatin technologies  inc on september   we filed a complaint in the superior court  judicial district of fairfield at bridgeport  connecticut  against palatin  in which we allege breach of contract by palatin of a mediated settlement agreement we signed with palatin on june  the mediated settlement  relating to a license between palatin and us for palatin s exclusive use of our technology in developing their experimental therapeutic treatment for male and female sexual dysfunction the license 
in our complaint we are seeking monetary damages  interest  attorneys fees  court costs  punitive damages  and other remuneration at the option of the court 
on november   palatin filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a dismissal of our complaint and monetary damages  including reimbursement of their legal fees  as sanctions against us for filing the original complaint this motion was denied on july  
on february   we filed a motion to enlarge the scope of our original complaint  alleging fraudulent behavior by palatin in their actions in negotiating the mediated settlement  as we believe that palatin was aware that they were unable to issue fully unrestricted shares of their common stock at the time that they agreed to do so as part of the mediated settlement  but agreed to do so anyway 
pursuant to the terms of the license  we are entitled to receive of any sublicense fee that palatin receives 
on august   palatin announced that they had granted a co exclusive license to king pharmaceuticals  inc king  included in a collaborative development and marketing agreement between palatin and king 
on august   palatin announced that they had received an initial million from king  but did not submit any funds to us  which caused us to notify palatin that they were in breach  and later demand arbitration for the breach 
we agreed first to try to mediate the dispute with palatin  and on june   we signed the mediated settlement agreement with palatin 
pursuant to the mediated settlement  palatin made a cash payment to us of  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of palatin unrestricted common stock 
the settlement we received was for both us and our clients 
on july   palatin issued restricted shares to us that were not registered for resale  which was not in accordance with the mediated settlement  as we were restricted from selling  transferring or otherwise disposing of the shares 
since palatin failed to issue us unrestricted shares and honor the mediated settlement  we filed the complaint against them seeking  at a minimum  unrestricted shares and reimbursement of costs that we incurred as a result of palatin s breach of the settlement 
on october   palatin filed a registration statement prospectus with the sec to register the restricted shares for sale  and we later determined that we could trade the shares even though the legend on the share certificate is still page 
table of contents in place 
we continued to pursue the complaint filed against palatin to recover our costs and preserve our rights under the license 
we believe that the mediated settlement referred only to the disposition of the specific million sublicensing fee received by palatin from king  and did not pertain to any future milestone payments  or to any other future payments to be made by king to palatin under their agreement 
palatin has made statements in their public filings that the june  mediated settlement released them from any other obligations to us relating to any other future payments received from king 
in addition  palatin has made other public filings in which they stated that they did not believe that any license from us was needed to commercialize their sexual dysfunction therapeutic product 
we disagree with these and any other similar such statements 
palatin also has received additional amounts from king since their receipt of the initial million payment  however  they have refused to acknowledge that they owe us any additional amounts pursuant to the license 
thus  as a result of palatin s additional alleged breaches of the license and tortious acts  on june   we demanded arbitration  as required by the license  to settle the new issues 
on july   we filed our claims with the american arbitration association 
further action in both the court case and the arbitration is pending 
employment matters employment matters former president and chief executive officer on august   we received notice that john b 
nano  our former president and ceo from june to june  had commenced suit in the superior court in the judicial district of stamford  connecticut seeking the pre judgment remedy of attachment

employment matters other former employees on february   osha issued a finding that there was probable cause to believe that ctt had violated section of the sarbanes oxley act by terminating wil jacques and scott bechtel in june based on the finding  osha ordered that the complainants be reinstated and that ctt pay damages totaling approximately  jacques and bechtel contended that they were improperly terminated for raising concerns about financial reporting 
we contended that jacques and bechtel did not raise protected concerns and were terminated for lawful  non discriminatory reasons  that osha failed to fairly investigate and consider all relevant facts  that the conclusions drawn by osha were legally erroneous  and that we were not liable to the complainants for any amount 
the osha finding did not constitute a final agency order

the hearing was held in may on may   ctt and plaintiff jacques entered into a memorandum of understanding  which later was approved by the alj  whereby all claims against ctt by jacques were resolved 
pursuant to the settlement with jacques  ctt paid plaintiff jacques a lump sum payment and reimbursement for certain reasonable legal fees  and agreed to pay him certain minimum consulting fees in and the lump sum payment and legal fee reimbursement were recorded in the consulting fees are not significant  and are recorded as they are paid 
on october   the alj s findings were issued  in which all of the claims of mr 
bechtel were dismissed  and further  that the issue of damages was not relevant since the plaintiff failed to carry his burden of proof

securities and exchange commission on august   the sec filed a civil suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut  naming competitive technologies  inc  our former president and ceo in  and six individual brokers  alleging that from at least july to june  the defendants were involved in a scheme to manipulate the price of our stock 
the case relates to our stock repurchase program under which we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time during the period from october  to march  ctt was named as a defendant in the suit due to the alleged conduct of our former ceo  whose conduct in connection with the stock repurchase program was imputed to ctt as a matter of law 
relating to ctt  the sec seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting us from further violations of the securities exchange act of  and a civil penalty pursuant to section d of the securities exchange act of this section provides for maximum penalties of  for a corporate entity and  per individual

if our motion for summary judgment is not successful  we expect that the case will go to trial sometime in laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp on june   the us supreme court the supreme court ruled that the writ of certiorari previously granted to laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp  had been improvidently granted  thus dismissing the writ and ending labcorp s appeal of this homocysteine assay infringement case originally filed on may  described below in the united states district court for the district of colorado 
a writ of certiorari is a petition requesting the court to hear an appeal 
on september   the district court ruled on the remaining outstanding motions and claims related to this case  and as result of the ruling  the case effectively ended with no further awards granted 
the original case was filed against labcorp in by metabolite laboratories  inc mli and us collectively  the plaintiffs alleging  in part  breach of contract and patent infringement  and that labcorp owed the plaintiffs royalties for homocysteine assays performed beginning in the summer of using methods falling within the claims of a patent we own 
we licensed the patent on a non exclusive basis to mli and mli sublicensed it to labcorp 
in november a jury confirmed the validity of our patent rights  found that labcorp had willfully infringed our patent and breached their sublicense contract  and awarded damages to the plaintiffs 
in an amended judgment issued in november  the court awarded ctt approximately  in damages   in enhanced punitive damages   in attorneys fees  and  in prejudgment interest  and had issued a permanent injunction barring labcorp from performing future homocysteine assays 
the injunction against performing tests was stayed by the court pursuant to a stipulated court order that expired in april pursuant to the stipulated order labcorp was allowed to perform assays in exchange for paying a royalty 
labcorp appealed the judgment  and on august   the cafc denied labcorp s appeal for a rehearing or a rehearing en banc rehearing by the full cafc 
as a result of this decision  on august   the plaintiffs received approximately million  our share of which was  and we recorded  in royalty legal awards and  in interest income during the payment did not include attorneys fees or court costs previously awarded to the plaintiffs that were under appeal with the court 
on january   the cafc issued a summary dismissal of labcorp s appeal of the court s award of attorneys fees and court costs from the original case 
subsequently  we received payment from labcorp for the attorneys fees and court costs 
our share of the payment was  and we recorded  in royalty legal awards and  in interest income  also in after this decision  on november   labcorp had appealed the case to the supreme court

overview we are a full service technology transfer and licensing provider 
we provide technology transfer  selling and licensing services focused on the technology needs of our customers  matching those requirements with commercially viable technology solutions  bridging the gap between market demand and raw innovation 
we develop relationships with universities  companies  inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their intellectual property rights  principally patents and inventions collectively  the technology  and they become our clients  for whom we find markets to sell or further develop their technology 
we also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies  and they become our customers  usually through a license or sublicense 
we identify and commercialize innovative technologies in life and physical sciences  electronics  and nanotechnologies developed by universities  companies and inventors 
our goal is to maximize the value of intellectual assets for the benefit of our clients  customers and shareholders 
we earn revenues primarily from licensing our clients and our own technologies to our customers licensees 
our customers pay us royalties based on their usage of the technology  and we share the fees with our clients 
in the normal course of our business  patents expire and revenues generated one year may not recur in the following year 
as explained below  in we had a concentration of revenues derived from four technologies 
because we have rounded all amounts in this item to the nearest thousand dollars  certain amounts may not total precisely 
in addition  all periods discussed in this item relate to our fiscal year ending july first  second  third and fourth quarters ending october  january  april and july  respectively

summary of results we incurred a net loss for of  or per share  compared to net income for of  or per diluted share  a decrease of  or per diluted share 
the reasons for the decrease in net income are explained in detail below 
in summary  the recurring revenue stream we have currently is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure 
in our three year strategic plan  we have addressed the issue of recurring revenues  and have plans in place to increase revenues sufficiently for us to be profitable on a long term basis 
revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
in  we received revenues from large  upfront license fees received related to our homocysteine technology  the magnitude of which was unusually high and did not recur in  and infrequently occurring revenues  including legal awards and dividends 
retained royalties for were  which was  or lower than the  reported in the following table compares revenues from technologies with retained royalties greater than or equal to  in or increase increase decrease decrease homocysteine assay ethyol gallium arsenide plasma display sexual dysfunction all other technologies total retained royalties approximately of our retained royalties for were from four technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  from gallium arsenide patents  and from plasma display 
we are seeking to expand our portfolio of revenue producing technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenues  to replace revenues from expiring licenses and to provide future revenues 
during and  we received  and  respectively  of upfront fees from new homocysteine licenses granted in the year 
while the receipt of upfront licensee fees is common  the magnitude of such fees will fluctuate  sometimes significantly from period to period 
without upfront license fees  revenues from this technology were  and  for and  respectively  or a slight increase from the increase was due to a combination of new licenses granted in and the inclusion in of a full year of revenues from several licenses granted during the prior year  partially offset by a decrease in in tests performed by one of our larger licensees 
our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expires in july royalties from ethyol sales are limited to a maximum of  per calendar year  and we have received this amount every calendar year since differences from year to year are due to timing of receipts 
we have no reason to believe that royalties from this technology will not reach the maximum per year for the next several years 
page 
table of contents us patents for gallium arsenide were issued from march to may this technology was licensed to several foreign and one us licensee 
patents expired starting in may and will continue to expire through september after september  we do not expect significant future revenues for this technology 
the decrease in gallium arsenide revenues in was due to the receipt in of a one time settlement of back royalties from one customer as a result of a royalty audit and subsequent litigation relating to an expired license 
our share of the settlement was  net of fees paid to a royalty auditing firm 
approximately  and  respectively  of retained royalties in and were from the us licensee s sales of licensed product  the remaining   and  in  and  respectively  were from several foreign licenses 
the decrease in revenues in compared to related to our sexual dysfunction technology was due to a settlement received from palatin technologies  inc palatin on june   related to a fee received by palatin in august the settlement was the result of a mediation of a prior dispute whereby we had demanded arbitration  which is the sole method of dispute resolution pursuant to the license between us and palatin  due to our belief that palatin was in material breach of the license for not paying us a percentage of the subcontract fee they received  as provided for in the license 
pursuant to the settlement  palatin made a cash payment to us  our share of which was  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of its unrestricted common stock  bringing the total recorded in for the settlement to  for further information  see item legal proceedings 
royalty legal awards of  in were from two awards we received related to litigation against laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp  including  from the original november decision in this homocysteine patent infringement case  that labcorp had appealed unsuccessfully  and  for attorneys fees and court costs also awarded to us in the original case 
there were no legal awards in we currently are pursuing infringement cases against three other defendants 
for a further description of the labcorp case other infringement cases  see item legal proceedings 
dividends received of  for were from our receipt of three separate dividends from melanotan corporation  in which we own approximately of the common stock 
these dividends are described in detail in the results of operations vs 
no dividends were received in investment income for was  compared to  in included in was  of interest from the labcorp awards  and  of interest earned on an outstanding note receivable that was fully repaid in without these items  investment income for increased  or  compared to the increase is due to a combination of significantly higher rates of return earned on invested cash and higher average monthly cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year 
page 
table of contents expenses increase increase decrease decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues general and administrative expenses patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements total expenses personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased a net  in  compared to  due to a combination of several factors 
personnel expenses decreased a net  in  compared to the prior year 
this was due to a  decrease in commission and bonus expense  as a result of the decrease in our financial results  partially offset by an increase aggregating to  in other personnel costs for recruiting expenses incurred to add business development and business development support employees  and for severance costs  and a net  increase for noncash compensation charges related to stock options 
we added the business development staff to increase our business development activities  which we believe will  in turn  result in more technologies being added to our portfolio and ultimately more signed licenses generating future recurring revenues 
the noncash stock option compensation expense of  was the result of our adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in that required us to recognize expense for stock options vesting during the year 
this expense will continue in future years 
previously we did not have to recognize any expense except if a prior grant was modified 
the noncash stock option compensation expense of  recognized in was related to modifications of stock options previously granted to a former employee 
other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased  principally as a result of less costs incurred in  compared to the prior year  for our review of the feasibility of certain technologies 
general and administrative expenses decreased a net  in  compared to  due to a combination of several factors 
legal and other defense costs related to a whistleblower claim filed against us by a former employee decreased  from the prior year 
the claim was dismissed  although the dismissal is being appealed 
general corporate legal expense decreased  compared to the prior year due to less activity 
investor relations and marketing expenses decreased  due to better cost management 
in addition  there was a  decrease in costs incurred in compared to the prior year to comply with the internal control documentation  testing and audit requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
was our first year under the sox requirements  and costs were high as a result of initial implementation costs  including the creation of original documentation  management testing and external auditing of management s testing results 
in the current year  we only had to update the documentation 
in addition  as a result of new regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  we were not required to have our independent auditors test our assertions about the effectiveness of our internal controls in  which reduced our current year costs since we did not have to accrue external audit fees for this purpose 
we still have compliance costs and such costs will be ongoing  since we have decided that we will maintain our internal control documentation and test our controls internally  even if not explicitly required by the sec 
in future years we believe that the sec will again require our independent auditors to test management s assertions about the effectiveness of our internal controls 
when this occurs our compliance costs will increase to reflect the additional costs of the audit 
partially offsetting these decreases  other legal expenses increased  in  compared to  related to our defense of two complaints filed against ctt by our former president and chief page 
table of contents executive officer ceo  and the complaint we filed against him seeking monetary and punitive damages for alleged breach of contract  breach of fiduciary duty  statutory theft of confidential information  and other claims see item legal proceedings 
legal expenses also increased because in we recorded a  credit to expense for a reimbursement from our directors and officers liability insurance carrier for legal costs incurred and expensed in prior years related to an sec investigation and subsequent civil suit 
there was no such credit in directors fees and expenses increased an aggregate of  principally as a result of an increase in the coverage levels of our directors and officers liability insurance  and a net increase in noncash stock option compensation expense 
in  we recognized noncash expense for stock options granted to directors pursuant to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement 
previously  we did not recognize expense related to stock options issued to directors  except that in we recognized expense relating to a modification of previously issued stock options 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  increased a net  in  compared to  as we incurred substantial costs to defend our homocysteine patent from an appeal to the us supreme court by labcorp of an earlier decision in our favor the appeal was unsuccessful 
the level of patent enforcement expenses relates to our legal strategies and varies depending on the stage and activity  if any  relating to each litigation 
in  we expect to incur costs in this area related to our infringement case against carolina liquid  et al  though we cannot estimate the magnitude see item legal proceedings 
provision for income taxes in current and prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax amt losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
in  we utilized a portion of our nol carry forwards against our regular federal and state taxable income  effectively eliminating our regular income tax liabilities 
however  in we expected to be subject to the amt liability  where we are limited to using of our nol carry forwards against taxable income 
our provision for income taxes of  principally was for our estimated net amt liability 
in  we incurred a loss but did not record a benefit since the benefit was fully reserved see below 
however  we did record a  benefit due to a change in estimate of the fiscal year federal amt liability 
in addition  we determined that we met certain conditions that made us eligible for a  refund of the amt paid in which we received subsequent to 
as a result  in we recorded in total a benefit for income taxes of  we will be subject to the full amt in future years 
the nols are an asset to us if we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
in  the benefit from our net loss was offset completely by a valuation allowance recorded against the asset 
thus  we did not show a benefit for income taxes  other than the benefit described above 
we will reverse the valuation allowance if we have future taxable income 
we have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
however  a significant portion of the nols remaining at july   approximately  were derived from income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
thus we will never receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations

table of contents results of operations vs 
summary of results net income for was  or per diluted share  compared to net income for of  or per diluted share  an improvement of  or per diluted share 
the reasons for the increase in net income are explained below 
revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
retained royalties for were  which was  or higher than the  reported in the following table compares revenues from technologies with retained royalties greater than or equal to  in or increase increase decrease decrease homocysteine assay gallium arsenide ethyol sexual dysfunction plasma display all other technologies total retained royalties as explained in detail below  included in the retained royalties were several non refundable  non creditable upfront license fees  a settlement of a back royalty audit  and a sublicense fee accrued related to sexual dysfunction 
these revenues may not recur in subsequent years  or may recur in different magnitudes 
in the total of such upfront license fees and the royalty audit aggregated to  of this amount  approximately  was from homocysteine licenses 
in there were no significant upfront license fees and no royalty audit settlements 
thus without these special revenues our retained royalties for would have been  and would have increased  or over approximately of our retained royalties for were from four technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  from gallium arsenide patents  and from sexual dysfunction 
we are seeking new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenues  to replace revenues from expiring licenses and to provide future revenues 
the increase in revenues from the homocysteine assay life sciences was due principally to non refundable  non creditable  upfront license fees and recurring royalties earned on new licenses granted during the year  including licenses granted to abbott laboratories abbott  axis shield  bayer corporation bayer  beckman coulter  dade behring  inc  diagnostic products corporation  ortho clinical diagnostics a johnson johnson company  and the diagnostics division of f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
roche 
these licenses  and other new licenses granted in relating to homocysteine testing  generally provide for a non refundable  non creditable against future royalties upfront license fee and a royalty to be paid to us based on a fixed fee per test 
the amount of the fixed fee is determined based on estimated volume 
all of the upfront license fees received in were in cash  except for bayer  which was paid one half upon signing the license  with the other half due in october page 
table of contents pursuant to the license with abbott  abbott agreed to pay us a non refundable  non creditable upfront license fee  certain milestone fees as defined in the license  and per test royalties on homocysteine assay sales made in the us after january  in january  upon receipt  we recorded  in retained royalties  representing our share of the upfront license fee 
the milestone fees  our share of which aggregates to  will be paid to us in two equal installments of  on january  and  as long as our patent is valid and enforceable 
we are accruing the present value of the aggregate of the milestone fees in retained royalties in calendar year and  accordingly  we accrued  in retained royalties from inception of the license through july  no per test royalties are payable from abbott in calendar year in general  in those cases where the homocysteine licensee makes or distributes test kits  the license granted in relieved the licensee s customers from their obligation to pay us royalties on tests performed using the licensee s homocysteine assay 
the license also released the licensee s customers of any obligation to pay us royalties for homocysteine tests performed using the licensee s assays in the past  but did not entitle them to any refund of any royalties previously paid to us 
with certain limited exceptions  the term of all of the homocysteine licenses granted is through july  the expiration date of the patent 
our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expires in july revenues  exclusive of upfront license fees  relating to the homocysteine assay continue to grow  and we believe that this trend will continue  but we cannot predict the magnitude of growth as we have no control over it  and we cannot predict if or when we will succeed in closing any additional license agreements and enforcing our patent rights 
we believe that we currently have licenses with the most significant distributors and laboratories in the united states that sell and or perform tests used to measure homocysteine levels 
however  since we also believe that there still are others using and or selling tests without a license  we continue to monitor the market to protect the patent rights of ourselves  our clients  and our current license holders  and will take action  including litigation  if necessary  to enforce and protect our patent rights 
we expect ethyol life sciences and the plasma display physical sciences retained royalties to continue at the current level for several years 
ethyol is an agent that reduces certain side effects of chemotherapy  and is licensed by southern research institute sri  exclusively to medimmune  inc formerly us bioscience  us pursuant to an agreement between ctt and sri  sri pays us up to a maximum of  per calendar year from ethyol license income it receives 
since calendar we have received the maximum revenue each year 
this patent expires in december inventions using gallium arsenide electronics to improve semiconductor operating characteristics were developed at the university of illinois 
us patents were issued from march to may patents expired starting in may and will continue to expire through september after september  we will not receive any future royalties for this technology 
we have licensed this technology to mitsubishi electric corporation  nec corporation  semiconductor company  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  sdl  inc  hitachi ltd  tottori sanyo electric co  ltd  toshiba corporation  and one us licensee some licenses have since expired 
the increase in gallium arsenide revenues resulted from a one time settlement of back royalties from one customer as a result of a royalty audit and subsequent litigation relating to an expired license 
our share of the settlement was  net of fees paid to a royalty auditing firm 
without this settlement  royalties would have decreased due to licenses that expired in the prior year 
approximately   and  respectively  of retained royalties in fiscal  and  were from the us licensee s sales of licensed product  the remaining   and  respectively  were from several foreign licenses 
the increase in revenues related to our sexual dysfunction technology was due to our settlement with palatin on june   related to a subcontract fee received by palatin in august the settlement was the result of a mediation of a prior dispute whereby we had demanded arbitration  as provided for in the license between us and palatin  due to our belief that palatin was in material breach of the license 
pursuant to the settlement  palatin made a cash payment to us  our share of page 
table of contents which was  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of its unrestricted common stock 
as we had not received the unrestricted common stock from palatin  we accrued as income  representing our share of the estimated value of the stock  after considering the effect of the stock restriction  bringing the total recorded for the settlement to  palatin tendered restricted shares to us that were not registered for resale 
since palatin failed to issue us unrestricted shares  we filed a complaint against them as a result of their failure to honor all the terms of the june  settlement 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
the palatin license is for palatin s exclusive use of our technology in developing their experimental therapeutic treatment for male and female sexual dysfunction 
pursuant to the terms of our license  we are entitled to receive of any sublicense fee that palatin receives 
on august   palatin announced that they had granted a co exclusive license to king pharmaceuticals  inc king  included in a collaborative development and marketing agreement between palatin and king 
on august   palatin announced that they had received an initial million from king  but did not submit any funds to us  which caused us to notify palatin that they were in breach  and later demand arbitration 
the mediation settlement entered into by ctt and palatin referred only to the disposition of this particular million fee received by palatin from king  and did not pertain to any future milestone payments  or to any other future payments to be made by king to palatin that may be covered under the palatin s license with us 
although palatin has made statements in their public filings that this agreement released them from any other obligations to us relating to future payments received from king  we disagree with their statements  and reserve our rights under the original license granted to palatin 
royalty legal awards were  for  and  for  and comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for and in we received two awards related to litigation with laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp  including  released from the original november decision in this homocysteine patent infringement case that upheld the validity of our homocysteine patent  and that labcorp had appealed unsuccessfully  and  for attorneys fees and court costs also awarded in the original case 
for a further discussion of the original case and labcorp s appeals  see item legal proceedings 
in  royalty legal awards were entirely from the finalization and receipt of our portion of the materna litigation award that had been ongoing for many years 
dividends received of  for were from our receipt of three separate dividends from our investee  melanotan corporation melanotan  in which we own approximately of the common stock 
there was no dividend income in we previously had purchased the shares of melanotan for a nominal amount  and  in a separate transaction  we licensed to melanotan certain rights relating to a sunless tanning technology that we own 
the technology may lessen or prevent skin cancer caused by unprotected sun exposure 
melanotan sublicensed the rights to epitan limited australia epitan  and also had received shares of epitan 
melanotan has no operations of its own 
epitan essentially is a research and development company that is in the process of conducting safety and efficacy trials  and evaluating the technology for future commercialization 
it currently is planning phase trials in australia generally the last stage of testing required prior to approval to market for the technology trials for use in the us will begin after that 
epitan common stock is traded on the australian stock exchange quoted in australian dollars under the symbol ept 
in  epitan changed its name to clinuvel pharmaceuticals limited  and its stock symbol was changed to cuv 
in october  melanotan paid its shareholders a dividend in the form of shares of epitan common stock 
as a result  we received  shares of epitan common stock 
as a condition to receiving the dividend  we agreed not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares before october  page 
table of contents we estimated the fair value of the epitan common stock using the closing price of the shares per share  australian dollars and the exchange rate for converting australian dollars to us dollars australian dollars to us dollar on the date that melanotan s board of directors approved the dividend 
we then discounted the value of the shares using a discount factor to recognize the estimated impact of the sale restriction epitan has minimal revenues and has incurred substantial current and accumulated net losses 
we recorded the estimated value of the shares   as dividend income and included the asset in equity securities available for sale 
in may melanotan paid a special cash dividend 
our share of the dividend was  in addition  in june  melanotan paid another dividend in the form of epitan common stock 
as a result  we received an additional  shares of epitan common stock and recorded additional dividend income of  as a condition to receiving this dividend  we again agreed not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares before october  we valued the shares and dividend received in the same manner as the october dividend except with a price per share of australian dollars  and exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollar 
in total  we received and now directly own  shares of epitan common stock 
our ownership percentage of epitan s common stock is not significant 
as a result of the dividends  melanotan does not own any more stock of epitan 
its only asset is the license and sublicense to the technology  and cash 
unrealized market price and foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the epitan shares have been included in other comprehensive loss in shareholders interest 
other comprehensive loss for the year ended july   was  consisting of an unrealized loss on the market value of the shares of  partially offset by an unrealized foreign exchange gain on the value of the us dollar compared to the australian dollar of  comprehensive income for the year ended july   was settlement with unilens  net for was  compared to  in  and related to our settlement with unilens corp 
usa unilens in october as a result of the settlement  in we recorded only interest income related to the settlement during the first three quarters of the year 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of unilens accelerating their payments on the receivable and paying the balance in full faster than we estimated in when we recognized the receivable  we recorded an additional  of gain 
at july   the receivable was paid in full

table of contents expenses increase increase decrease decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues general and administrative expenses patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements impairment loss on investments total expenses personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues increased due to several factors 
personnel expenses for increased  from the prior year 
this was due principally to bonus and commission accruals that increased  compared to salaries  payroll taxes and employee benefits also increased approximately  due to an increase in the number of our employees  certain salary increases  and for a noncash charge of  incurred as a result of modifying the terms of certain stock options previously granted to a former employee to extend the exercise terms of the options there was no such expense in the prior year 
in addition  other direct expenses increased  principally due to legal fees incurred in connection with the gallium arsenide back royalty litigation and settlement  a one time charge for technical services to support licensing a technology which costs are partially recoverable from future licensing revenues  if any  legal and other costs related to litigating and licensing our homocysteine assay to others  and other costs to maintain certain technologies 
offsetting these increases  consultants fees and expenses decreased approximately  as some former consultants were hired as employees  severance costs decreased  as we paid severance to a former officer during  and recruiting and relocation costs decreased  there were no severance  recruiting or relocation costs incurred in general and administrative expenses increased due to several factors 
we incurred approximately  in legal costs related to our defense of a preliminary finding against us by the occupational safety and health administration  and related court issues  and  in estimated legal costs related to a complaint filed against us by our former president and ceo 
both are described in more detail in item legal proceedings 
in we also incurred approximately  of costs that we did not incur in the prior year to comply with the internal control documentation and testing requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of this compliance cost will be ongoing 
other increases included  in expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including costs relating to our annual report  proxy  annual meeting  and costs relating to investor relations  and an increase of  in travel related both to investor relations and to review new business opportunities 
directors fees and expenses increased  principally due to a noncash charge of  incurred as a result of modifying the terms of certain stock options previously granted to a former director to extend the exercise term of the options there was no such expense in the prior year  and  in increased fees and expenses as a result of more board meetings being held in service fees and expenses increased  over due to new business initiatives being explored 
partially offsetting the increases described above was a credit of  recorded in for a reimbursement from our directors and officers liability insurance carrier  as settlement of litigation we had filed against the carrier seeking reimbursement under our policy of legal fees incurred since in connection with an investigation of ctt by the securities and exchange commission sec see item legal proceedings 
our insurance carrier also acknowledged that we had met our deductible under our policy relating to this matter  and confirmed that they will provide and have provided coverage  in accordance with the terms of the policy  for losses incurred in the sec civil suit filed in august page 
table of contents accordingly  we have recorded a credit and not any significant costs in relating to the sec investigation and civil suit  compared to  of expense in patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  reflect our level of activity and vary depending on the stage of the litigation 
our overall activity in was higher than in  principally due to litigation related to the labcorp and several other homocysteine cases  and the palatin arbitration 
however  due to the income generated from new homocysteine licenses  we were able to recover a significant amount of expense incurred in and prior years from the new revenues generated  which more than offset costs incurred in  resulting in an overall credit balance for the year in the expense 
provision for income taxes in prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
this fiscal year  we will utilize a portion of our nols against our current year regular federal and state taxable income  effectively eliminating our regular income tax liabilities 
however  we expect to be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax amt  where we are limited to using our nols against only of our income  and our year to date provision is for our estimated amt liability 
the nols are an asset to us since we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
as a result of the income we earned for the year  we reversed  of the valuation allowance  representing the amount of the nol we will utilize to offset any income tax liability excluding the amt liability  on income earned during the year  and recorded a provision for income taxes of the same amount 
the effective income tax rate of the provision for the year was 
the difference between the effective rate and our combined statutory federal and state rates of approximately for the year  was due principally to the impact of dividend income  which is included in book income at its full amount but due to favorable tax regulations  is virtually excluded from taxable income 
we used our nols to eliminate our regular income tax liability  and the provision recorded principally is for our estimated amt liability 
we continue to have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
however  a significant portion of the nols remaining at july   approximately  were derived from income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
thus we will not receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations 
we did not record an income tax provision in since we incurred a substantial net operating loss for income tax purposes 
this was due principally to the unilens receivable that had no basis for book purposes but was fully valued for income tax purposes 
as a result  the settlement with unilens in october generated a significant loss on an income tax basis  compared to income of  on a book basis

table of contents financial condition and liquidity our liquidity requirements arise principally from our working capital needs  including funds needed to find and obtain new technologies and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  if necessary 
we fund our liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations  if any  including royalty legal awards 
in addition  through july  we were able to finance a portion of our liquidity requirements through sales of common stock pursuant to an equity financing arrangement see below 
at july   we had no outstanding debt or available credit facility  and we believe that it would be very difficult for ctt to obtain any form of debt financing due to the current composition of our balance sheet  including a lack of hard assets against which to borrow  and the unpredictable nature of our annual cash flows 
thus  our financing options currently are limited  and we must rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations  if any  though this situation could change in the future 
we did obtain equity financing in which we completed in we continue to review financing options for our business  which may in the future include more equity financing 
however  since our current cash position is strong  we expect that if we do obtain any financing commitment  initially it would be utilized on a standby basis 
we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  expected recurring revenues and any new revenues from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operating cash requirements at least through fiscal our strategic plan calls for us to increase our recurring revenues by bringing in new technologies for licensing 
however  we recognize that this plan will take a few years to fully develop  and in the interim without other sources of revenues or financing  we will continue to incur net losses and our cash position will continue to decline 
cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid  interest earning investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less  including overnight bank deposits and money market funds 
we carry cash equivalents at cost  which approximates fair value 
during the year ended july   we completed our equity financing see below  which provided a significant amount of cash during the year 
since that financing has been completed  in we will be limited to financing our liquidity needs solely from cash on hand  and cash flow from operations  if any 
at july   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at july  cash used in operating activities in was  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in the decrease in cash provided by operations in the current year principally was the result of the loss incurred in compared to significant net income in cash used in investing activities was  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the prior year 
in  we used cash to acquire equipment to replace existing assets and to equip new personnel  and made deposits on furniture for our new office space 
in  we received cash collections on the unilens receivable  which was paid in full by the end of so we did not receive any cash during net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to  in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in compared to  was due to cash received in as the result of exercises of stock options 
we receive cash equivalent to the exercise price of the stock option exercised 
there were few stock option exercises in in both years we generated cash from sales of common stock pursuant to our equity financing arrangement  which was completed in thus  currently we do not expect to generate any significant cash from investing activities in in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of retained royalties revenues reported  changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect our normal cycle of royalty collections and payments

table of contents funding and capital requirements equity financing in february  we entered into an agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a twenty month period from the commencement date  which was may  the stock sale agreement 
we had the right  which we exercised  to extend the term of the stock sale agreement by six months 
we also had the right to determine the timing and the amount of stock sold  if any  to fusion capital 
in june  the stock sale agreement terminated upon reaching the million threshold of common stock sold to fusion capital 
pursuant to the stock sale agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to fusion capital at inception for its initial commitment the initial shares  and issued  additional commitment shares to fusion capital on a pro rata basis as we sold the million of stock collectively  the commitment shares 
cash received and common stock sold and issued pursuant to the stock sale agreement were as follows commitment cash shares shares total received sold issued shares year ended july  year ended july  year ended july  total we had the option to enter into a second agreement with fusion capital for the sale of an additional million of common stock on the same terms and conditions as the stock sale agreement  but we did not exercise our option 
income taxes we currently have the benefit of using a portion of our accumulated nols to eliminate any future regular federal and state income tax liabilities 
we will continue to receive this benefit until we have utilized all of our nols federal and state 
however  we cannot determine when and if we will be profitable and utilize the benefit of the remaining nols before they expire 
capital requirements we previously announced that part of our strategic plan was to achieve million in annual recurring revenues over the next few years and achieve long term profitability and increase shareholder value 
to accomplish our goals  we have increased our efforts and are investing funds to explore new business opportunities  including expanding our marketing capabilities on a more global basis  searching for new sources of technologies and to license those technologies  offering services for the first time  and researching potential acquisition candidates or other strategic relationships 
to accomplish our revenue goals  we have added more personnel to our business development team and added other personnel to support our expanding global business development activities 
these activities require greater amounts of capital than we used previously 
we expect this trend to continue 
in addition  as explained below  in august we moved to a new office 
in connection with the move to the new space we committed to spend in an aggregate of approximately  above our normal capital requirements  to purchase furniture and equipment for our new office space and make certain leasehold improvements 
page 
table of contents the new office space we moved into in august is larger than our previous office to accommodate our additional staff and provide for more efficient operations  as all of our staff are now on one floor of the new building  compared to being split among two floors in the old office 
there was no significant disruption or impact to our operations as a result of the move to the new office 
however  since the new space is larger than the prior space  our new rent expense in and beyond will be approximately   more on an annual basis than we incurred in other as a result of the investments described above  and the incurrence of increased rent costs  our cash operating costs have and will continue to increase significantly in the next fiscal year 
the amounts and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the results of our operations and marketing efforts  the results and costs of legal proceedings  and any financing we obtain 
to achieve and sustain profitability  we must license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  and continually add new licenses 
however  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting rights to licensees  enforcing intellectual property rights  and collecting royalty revenues are subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control and or that we cannot currently anticipate 
contractual obligations and contingencies at july   our contractual obligations were payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations  principally rent purchase obligations any other commitments we may have are contingent upon a future event 
contingencies our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we currently are exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the sec civil suit  with a complaint filed by a former employee alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of  and a complaint filed by our former president and ceo see item legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
we also carry liability insurance  casualty insurance for owned or leased tangible assets  and other insurance as needed to cover us against potential and actual claims and lawsuits that occur in the ordinary course of our business 
many of our license and service agreements provide that we apply upfront license fees  license fees and or royalties we receive against amounts that our clients or we have incurred for patent application  prosecution  issuance and maintenance costs 
if we incur such costs  we expense them as we incur them  and reduce our expense if we are reimbursed from future fees and or royalties we receive 
if the reimbursement belongs to our client  we record no revenue or expense 
page 
table of contents as of july   ctt and its majority owned subsidiary  vector vision  inc vvi  have remaining obligations  contingent upon receipt of certain revenues  to repay up to  and  respectively  in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt also is obligated to pay at the rate of of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay at rates of of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
we recognize these obligations only if we receive revenues related to the grant funds 
no significant obligations were recognized in since the applicable revenues received were not significant 
currently  we engage independent consultants who provide us with business development  consulting and or evaluation services under contracts that are cancelable on certain written notice 
these contracts include contingencies for potential incentive compensation earned solely on sales resulting directly from the work of the consultant 
we have neither accrued nor paid significant incentive compensation under such contracts 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on the information available at the time  and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
by their nature  estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to change at any time  and may depend on factors we cannot control 
as a result  if future events differ from our estimates  assumptions and judgments  we may need to adjust or revise them in later periods 
we believe the following significant estimates  assumptions and judgments we used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our financial condition and operations 
upfront license fees received upfront license fees received in and from new licenses were recorded in retained royalties in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation on a fair value basis 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including  estimating the expected life of the stock option  volatility  and the amount of share based awards that can be expected to be forfeited 
our estimates were based on our historical experience with stock option awards 
abbott receivable included in receivables at july   is a receivable from abbott which will be paid in january  as long as our homocysteine patent is valid and enforceable 
we do not believe that an allowance is required for this receivable and have not provided one 
equity securities we believe that unrealized decreases in the value of our equity securities are temporary and therefore we have not recognized any losses in earnings 
if circumstances change or we otherwise determine that the decreases in value are other than temporary  then we will recognize losses at that time 
equity securities are page 
table of contents classified as either a current or long term asset depending upon our intent to hold or possibly dispose of the securities  although our intent is subject to change 
related party transactions our board of directors determined that when a director s services are outside the normal duties of a director  we compensate the director at the rate of  per day  plus expenses which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one day board meeting 
we classify these amounts as consulting expenses included in personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues 
we incurred charges for consulting services including expenses and use taxes provided by one director of   and  in  and  respectively 
we also incurred charges of  in for consulting services provided by a relative of our president and ceo 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have significant market risk to the valuation of our assets other than risks related to our equity security holdings of palatin and clinuvel 
the value of the palatin stock is included in current assets in equity securities  while the value of the clinuvel shares is included in noncurrent assets in equity securities  since our current intention is to hold the clinuvel shares as a long term investment 
the value of both assets is subject to market fluctuations in the per share price of the stock as well as foreign currency fluctuations relating to the clinuvel shares  since clinuvel common stock is traded on the australian stock exchange  and the price per share of the stock is quoted in australian dollars 
we currently consider unrealized fluctuations in the fair value of both the palatin and clinuval shares to be temporary  and therefore have recorded changes in the fair values as part of other comprehensive loss  which is included as a component of equity 
during the year ended july   the following changes in fair value occurred with respect to the palatin and clinuvel shares year ended july  palatin clinuvel total unrealized increase decrease in market price of securities held unrealized translation adjustments on securities held unrealized gain from reversal of sale restriction discounts on securities held other comprehensive income loss page
