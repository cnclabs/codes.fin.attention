seasonal cash needs are met by financing secured by proprietary accounts receivable and lines of credit available under its revolving credit facilities

key financial ratios that provide certain measures of the company s liquidity are as follows january  january  restated january  restated in thousands working capital current ratio debt capitalization earnings to fixed charges the decrease in the company s current ratio in fiscal is due to accounts payable increasing at a higher rate than inventory and the increase of million in the current portion of long term debt

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of accounts  historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts 
delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
for all other accounts  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience 
factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely 
conversely  improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in  first out fifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends  expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories  an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate 
vendors allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business and summary of accounting policies 
insurance reserve estimates the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by its associates 
the company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies  the company retains the initial risk of  and  respectively  per occurrence 
the company also has a lifetime medical payment limit of million 
impairment of assets and closed store reserves the company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights 
the related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to years 
the company reviews whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets held for use including favorable lease rights are present annually or whenever an event  such as decisions to close a store  indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves 
decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
if the store is leased  a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use 
a significant change in cash flows  market valuation  demand for real estate or other factors  could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge

many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise
