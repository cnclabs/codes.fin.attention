on april   ravelston  which is the controlling stockholder of hollinger inc  filed for protection from its creditors under the companies creditors arrangement act canada the ccaa 
in conjunction with that filing  the ontario superior court of justice appointed a receiver of ravelston s assets 
prior to the appointment of the receiver  hollinger inc and the company were indirectly controlled by lord conrad m 
black of crossharbour black  a former director  chairman and ceo of the company  through his personal control of ravelston 
as more fully described in its report  the special committee concluded that during the period from at least to at least  black  in breach of his fiduciary duties as a controlling stockholder and officer and director  used his control over the affairs of the company to divert cash and other assets from the company and to conceal his actions from the company s public stockholders 
the sec  in its complaint filed with the federal court in illinois on november   alleges that certain of the acts and omissions of black violated federal securities laws in several respects in the period from at least to at least in addition  the delaware chancery court found that during the period from november to early  black breached his fiduciary and contractual duties persistently and seriously in connection with the company s exploration of alternative strategic transactions  and purported to adopt bylaws disabling the board of directors from protecting the company from his wrongful acts 
on january   the company consented to the entry of a partial judgment and order of permanent injunction the court order against the company in an action brought by the sec in the us district court for the northern district of illinois the january sec action

since these nominees were not endorsed by the company s board of directors  breeden became special monitor of the company pursuant to the court order  which provides for breeden s appointment in the event of the nomination or election to the board of directors of any individual without the support of at least of incumbent board members 
the special monitor s mandate  among other matters  is to protect the interests of the company s non controlling stockholders to the extent permitted by law 
although the various protections sought and or approved by the company have been designed  or otherwise serve  to prevent hollinger inc and black from engaging again in activities similar to those detailed by the special committee  there can be no assurance that they will remain in place or will not be modified or vacated in the future 
if any of these events were to occur  there is a risk that ravelston and hollinger inc will again use their control over the affairs of the company to take actions detrimental to the non controlling stockholders of the company

table of contents the company s controlling stockholder has taken actions that trigger the special monitor provisions of the court order 
the court order  to which the company consented  provides for a special monitor under certain circumstances

the company s senior management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management 
the efforts of the current senior management team and board of directors to manage the company s business have been hindered at times by their need to spend significant time and effort to resolve issues inherited from and arising from the conduct of the prior senior management team and the direct and indirect controlling stockholders 
to the extent the senior management team and the board of directors will be required to devote significant attention to these matters in the future  this may have  at least in the near term  an adverse effect on operations 
risks relating to the company s business and the industry the company s revenue is cyclical and dependent upon general economic conditions in the company s target markets 
advertising and circulation are the company s two primary sources of revenue 
the company s advertising revenue and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenue are cyclical and dependent upon general economic conditions in the company s target markets 
the company s advertising revenue experiences seasonality with the first quarter typically being the lowest and the fourth quarter being the highest 
historically  increases in advertising revenue have corresponded with economic recoveries while decreases 
table of contents have corresponded with general economic downturns and regional and local economic recessions 
advertising revenue for the sun times news group in was down by million or over the prior year 
the company s dependency on advertising sales  which generally have a short lead time  means that the company has only a limited ability to accurately predict future revenue and operating results 
the company is a holding company and relies on the company s subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations 
the company is a holding company and its assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
the company relies on distributions from subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations 
the company s ability to meet its future financial obligations may be dependent upon the availability of cash flows from its subsidiaries through dividends  intercompany advances  management fees and other payments 
similarly  the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock may be limited as a result of being dependent upon the distribution of earnings of the company s subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
the company s subsidiaries and affiliated companies are under no obligation to pay dividends and  in the case of publishing and its principal domestic and foreign subsidiaries  are subject to certain statutory restrictions and may become subject to restrictions in future debt agreements that limit their ability to pay dividends 
the company has substantial potential tax liabilities 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of accruals intended to cover contingent liabilities related to additional taxes and interest it may be required to pay in various tax jurisdictions 
a substantial portion of these accruals relate to the tax treatment of gains on the sale of a portion of the company s non us operations in prior years 
the accruals to cover contingent tax liabilities also relate to management fees  non competition payments and other items that have been deducted in arriving at taxable income  which deductions may be disallowed by taxing authorities 
if those deductions were to be disallowed  the company would be required to pay additional taxes and interest since the dates such taxes would have been paid had the deductions not been taken  and it may be subject to penalties 
the company will continue to record accruals for interest that it may be required to pay with respect to its contingent tax liabilities 
although the company believes that it has defensible positions with respect to significant portions of these tax liabilities  there is a risk that the company may be required to make payment of the full amount of such tax liabilities 
although these accruals for contingent tax liabilities are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet  if the company were required to make payment of the full amount  this could result in significant cash payment obligations 
the actual payment of such cash amount could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and on the company s ability to borrow funds 
the company has substantial accruals for tax contingencies in a foreign jurisdiction  if payments are required  a portion may be paid with funds denominated in us dollars 
the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  includes million of accruals for tax contingencies in a foreign jurisdiction 
the accruals are denominated in a foreign currency and translated into us dollars at the period end currency exchange rate effective as of each balance sheet date 
if the company were required to make payments with respect to such tax contingencies  it may be necessary for the company to transfer us dollar denominated funds to its foreign subsidiaries to fund such payments 
the amount of us dollar denominated funds that may need to be transferred also will depend upon the ultimate amount that is payable to the foreign jurisdiction and the currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the foreign currency at the time or times such funds might be transferred 
the company cannot predict future currency exchange rates 
changes in the exchange rate could have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows particularly as it relates to the extent and timing of any transfers of funds 

table of contents newsprint represents the company s single largest raw material expense and changes in the price of newsprint could affect net income 
newsprint represents the company s single largest raw material expense and is the most significant operating cost other than employee costs 
in  newsprint costs represented approximately of revenue 
newsprint prices vary widely from time to time and increased approximately during if newsprint prices remain at current levels or increase in the future and the company is unable to pass these costs on to customers  such increases may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
although the company has  in the past  implemented measures in an attempt to offset a rise in newsprint prices  such as reducing page width where practical and managing waste through technology enhancements  newsprint price increases have in the past had a material adverse effect on the company and may do so in the future 
competition in the newspaper industry originates from many sources 
the advent of new technologies and industry practices  such as the provision of newspaper content on free internet sites  may decrease sales or force the company to make other changes that harm operating performance 
revenue in the newspaper industry is dependent primarily upon advertising revenue and paid circulation 
competition for advertising and circulation revenue comes from local and regional newspapers  radio  broadcast and cable television  direct mail and other communications and advertising media that operate in the company s markets 
the extent and nature of such competition is  in large part  determined by the location and demographics of the markets and the number of media alternatives in those markets 
some of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company may experience price competition from newspapers and other media sources in the future 
in addition  newspapers competing in certain markets have added new  free publications that target similar demographics to those that are particularly strong for some of the company s newspapers 
lastly  the use of alternative means of delivery  such as free internet sites  for news and other content has increased significantly in the past few years 
should significant numbers of customers choose to receive content using these alternative delivery sources rather than the company s newspapers  the company may be forced to decrease the prices charged for the company s newspapers or make other changes in the way the company operates  or the company may face a long term decline in circulation  any or all of which may harm the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s publications have experienced declines in circulation in the past and may do so in the future 
certain of the company s publications have experienced declines in circulation 
any significant declines in circulation the company may experience at its publications could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations  particularly on advertising revenue 
significant declines in circulation could result in an impairment of the value of the company s intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company may experience labor disputes  which could slow down or halt production or distribution of the company s newspapers or other publications 
approximately of the sun times news group employees are represented by labor unions 
those employees are mostly covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements which are regularly renewable 
a work stoppage or strike may occur prior to the expiration of the current labor agreements or during negotiations of new labor agreements or extensions of existing labor agreements 
work stoppages or other labor related developments could slow down or halt production or distribution of the newspapers  which would adversely affect results of operations 

table of contents a substantial portion of the company s operations are concentrated in one geographic area 
with the sale of the telegraph group in july  the jerusalem post in december  and the canadian newspapers in late and early  all of the company s revenue and business activities are concentrated in the greater chicago metropolitan area 
as a result  the company s revenue is dependent on economic and competitive factors affecting the greater chicago metropolitan area 
the company s internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of december  and weaknesses in the company s internal controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s management concluded that material weaknesses existed in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  see item a controls and procedures 
the sec  in its complaint filed with the federal court in illinois on november  naming black  f 
david radler radler and hollinger inc as defendants  alleges that black  radler and hollinger inc 
were liable for the company s failure to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap from at least through at least the sec also alleges that black  radler and hollinger inc  directly and indirectly  falsified or caused to be falsified  books  records  and accounts of the company in order to conceal their self dealing from the company s public stockholders 
current management have taken steps to correct internal control deficiencies and weaknesses during and subsequent to  and believes that the company s internal controls and procedures have strengthened 
however  it is possible that the company may not be able to remediate all deficiencies and material weaknesses by december  overstatement of circulation figures in the past may result in the loss of advertisers in the future 
in june  the company announced that the audit committee of its board of directors the audit committee had initiated an internal review into practices that resulted in the overstatement of circulation figures for the chicago sun times 
following the announcement  several lawsuits were filed against the company 
see item legal proceedings the chicago sun times circulation cases 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of advertising space in the chicago sun times 
should certain advertisers decide not to advertise with the chicago sun times in the future  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
risks related to voting control by a single stockholder there could be a change of control of the company through a change in control of hollinger inc under circumstances not approved by the independent directors of the company

on august   hollinger inc commenced a change of control tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding senior secured notes and second priority secured notes 
on september   hollinger inc announced that no notes were tendered pursuant to the change of control tender offer

there is a risk that this result would be challenged in court by hollinger inc or its insolvency representatives 
in an insolvency or secured creditor enforcement proceeding  the ownership rights  including voting rights  attached to the shares of the company s class a and class b common stock would be exercised with a view to maximizing value for the secured creditors and other stakeholders of hollinger inc since the interests of secured creditors and other stakeholders of hollinger inc may not be aligned with the interests of the company s public stockholders  actions might be taken that are not in the best interests of the company s public stockholders

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these areas include bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  observance of trends in particular areas  information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for contingent tax liabilities at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes million of accruals intended to cover contingent liabilities for taxes and interest it may be required to pay in various tax jurisdictions 
a substantial portion of the accruals relates to the tax treatment of gains on the sale of a portion of the company s non us operations 
the accruals to cover contingent tax liabilities also relate to management fees  non competition payments and other items that have been deducted in arriving at taxable income  which deductions may be disallowed by taxing authorities 
if those deductions were to be disallowed  
table of contents the company would be required to pay additional taxes and interest since the dates such taxes would have been paid had the deductions not been taken 
the company may also be subject to penalties 
the ultimate resolution of these tax contingencies will be dependent upon a number of factors  including discussions with taxing authorities and the nature  extent and timing of any restitution or reimbursement received by the company 
the company believes that the accruals that have been recorded are adequate to cover the tax contingencies 
if the ultimate resolution of the tax contingencies is more or less favorable than what has been assumed by management in determining the accruals  the accruals may ultimately be excessive or inadequate in amounts that are not presently determinable  but such amounts may be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
potential impairment of goodwill the company has significant goodwill recorded in its accounts 
the company is required to determine at least annually  whether or not there has been any permanent impairment in the value of these assets 
certain indicators of potential impairment that could impact the company include  but are not limited to  the following i a significant long term adverse change in the business climate that is expected to cause a substantial decline in advertising spending  ii a permanent significant decline in newspaper readership  iii a significant adverse long term negative change in the demographics of newspaper readership and iv a significant technological change that results in a substantially more cost effective method of advertising than newspapers 
valuation allowance deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount which  the company estimates  is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  the resulting adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase net earnings in the period such a determination was made 
similarly  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would decrease net earnings in the period that such a determination was made 
defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefits the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans for domestic and foreign employees 
these defined benefit plans include pension and post retirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
in determining these obligations and related expenses  key assumptions are made concerning expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  the company evaluates  among other things  input from actuaries  expected long term market returns and current high quality bond rates 
the company will continue to evaluate the expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized by the company over a period of approximately years  which represents the weighted average remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience  changes in assumptions and from differences between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  the company had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
these unrecognized amounts could result in an increase to 
table of contents pension expense in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
during  the company made contributions of million to defined benefit pension plans 
global capital market and interest rate fluctuations could impact future funding requirements for such plans 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional company contributions may be required 
if the company is required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit pension plans  reported results could be adversely affected  and the company s cash flow available for other uses would be reduced
