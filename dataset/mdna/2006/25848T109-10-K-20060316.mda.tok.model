the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of storage systems for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add capacity as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete turn key  multi terabyte storage area networks  provides end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our products and services are sold worldwide to end users primarily through our channel partners  including oems  sis  and vars 
in may  we entered into a three year oem agreement with sun to provide our storage hardware and software products for private label sales by sun 
we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october we have continued to develop new products primarily for resale by sun  such as our sannet ii fc  which began shipping to sun in march and our sannet ii sata product which began shipping in june we are discussing with sun the extent and timing of additional new product shipments 
in september  our existing oem partner agreement with sun  first announced in may  was extended until january and now provides for automatic renewal for additional one year periods unless either party notifies the other of its intent not to renew within a certain 
table of contents period of time 
we intend to continue expanding our non oem sales channels through sis and vars in order to decrease our revenue concentration with oems 
in july  we entered into a development and oem supply agreement with netapp 
under the agreement  we are designing and developing general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products to be developed for sale to netapp 
we believe that once sales under this agreement increase  which is expected to occur over the next several quarters  our revenue dependence upon sun will be significantly reduced 
in january  we entered into a master purchase agreement with fujitsu 
under the agreement  dot hill and fujitsu will jointly develop storage solutions utilizing key components and patented technologies from 
dot hill 
the agreement does not contain any minimum purchase commitments by fujitsu 
the initial agreement term is five years 
as part of our focus on indirect sales channels  we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to solectron  a leading electronics manufacturing services company 
our agreement with solectron allows us to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  increase working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of solectron s manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our sannet ii family of products 
in prior periods  we derived a significant portion of our revenue from sales of our legacy products and sannet i family of products 
except for one oem customer to whom we continue to sell our sannet i products  we have transitioned all customers to our sannet ii products 
we derive a portion of our revenue from services associated with the maintenance service we provide for our installed products 
in may  we entered into a services agreement with anacomp to provide all maintenance  warranty and non warranty services for our sannet i and certain legacy products 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions and expenditures for administrative facilities 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of employee severance  lease termination costs and other office closure expenses related to the consolidation of excess facilities 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in our interest expense primarily relates to a million note payable that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral 
during august  we made a payment of approximately million representing both principle and interest to the holder of the promissory note assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in february there are no further amounts due 
in august  we merged with artecon and we changed our name from box hill systems corp 
to dot hill systems corp 
we reincorporated in delaware in our headquarters is located in carlsbad  california  and we maintain international offices in germany  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom 
on february   we completed the acquisition of chaparral  a privately held developer of specialized storage appliances as well as high performance  mid range raid controllers and data routers 
the total transaction cost of approximately million consisted of a payment of approximately million in cash  the assumption of approximately million related to obligations due certain employee covered by change in control agreements  approximately million of direct transaction costs and approximately million of accrued integration costs 
we believe the acquisition of chaparral has enabled us to increase 
table of contents the amount of proprietary technology within our storage systems  broaden our product line and diversify our customer base 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty cost accruals  revenue recognition  bad debt allowances  long lived assets valuation  goodwill and intangible assets valuation  income taxes  including deferred income tax asset valuation  litigation and contingencies 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
we recognize revenue for non software product sales upon transfer of title to the customer 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are also recorded at that time 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally  these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and significantly greater response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar services  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
for software sales  we apply sop  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses at the time the product is delivered  provided there are no significant obligations related to the sale  the resulting receivable is deemed collectible and there is vendor specific objective evidence supporting the value of the separate contract elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items 
a portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements  typically software maintenance contracts  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes a software licensing fee and maintenance agreement 
the cost of maintenance contracts entered into with third parties is deferred and recognized as expense over the contract term 
the balance of deferred costs for maintenance contracts is included in prepaid expenses  other current assets and other long term assets 

table of contents valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform periodic valuation assessments based on projected sales forecasts and analyzing upcoming changes in future configurations of our products and record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts  we periodically are faced with uncertainties 
the outcomes of these uncertainties are not within our control  and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and commitments  and consequently  on our operating results 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those forecasted  additional inventory write downs might be required  adversely affecting operating results 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and adjust the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
due to our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code  or irc  section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill systems corp 
immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of irc section f in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of the acquired 
table of contents chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
at december   based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative profitability in recent years  we determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of our us deferred tax assets would be realized and  at december   eliminated million of valuation allowance associated with our us deferred tax assets 
the elimination of valuation allowance resulted in a million decrease to goodwill to the extent of our acquired net deferred tax assets  a million increase to equity for net operating losses arising from stock option deductions  with the remaining million recognized as a one time non cash increase in earnings for the year ended december  as a result of our elimination of valuation allowance associated with us deferred tax assets  our effective tax rate in subsequent periods is likely to more closely resemble the applicable federal and state statutory tax rates 
stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic method  we did not record any expenses as the exercise price of stock options granted equalled the fair market value of our stock at the date of grant 
on december   the company accelerated vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded under the company s equity compensation plans to its employees 
these options were accelerated to avoid recording future compensation expense with respect to such options following adoption of sfas no 
r as discussed below 
the company s management believes that because such options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the company s stock  the options were not achieving their original objective 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of december  options to purchase million shares of common stock were subject to the acceleration and the weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was 
due to this acceleration  an additional million is included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  commencing january   we will adopt sfas no 
r  stock based compensation  which requires us to record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no 
r 
see the recent accounting pronouncements section below for further information 
contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims and tax matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding contingencies 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated year ended december net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development restructuring expenses operating income loss other income  net income tax expense benefit net income percentages may not aggregate due to rounding year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our channel partner  sun  as a result of a change in product mix 
our sales to sun accounted for or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to or million for the year ended december  total fibre channel units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  fibre channel units shipped for the year ended december   scsi units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  scsi units for the year ended december   blade units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  blade units shipped for the year ended december   sata units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  sata units shipped for the year ended december  in march  we announced that our existing oem partner agreement with sun was expanded to include new advanced technology storage products to be designed and engineered by us to sun s specifications 
our sata product began shipping in the second quarter of while our blade product began shipping in the first quarter of we recorded revenue of approximately million and million related to sata and blade products during the years ended december  and  respectively 
non sun revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  cost of goods sold increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to 
table of contents greater volume of product sales during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of salaries from an increase in staffing  an increase of depreciation expense resulting from increased equipment purchases related to ramp up activities at an asian location of our contract manufacturer  the disposal of certain production related fixed assets and the failure to obtain the usual disk drive price reductions due to the industry wide shortage of disk drives 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of gross profit is attributable to increased spending related to the items discussed above 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue for year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  can be attributed  in part  to continued pricing pressures on our mature products  to changes in customer and product mix  to lower than anticipated sales volume and the failure to obtain the usual disk drive price reductions due to the industry wide shortage of disk drives 
our gross profit margin was also negatively impacted for the year ended december  by sales of our sata product that presently have a significantly lower gross profit margin than either our fibre channel or scsi products 
gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by a full twelve months of amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the chaparral transaction for the year ended december  as compared to months of amortization for the year ended december  amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the chaparral transaction was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the year of reflects only ten months of amortization due as a result of the chaparral acquisition in late february sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is partially attributable to a full year of salaries and related expenses for those employees added in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in late february compared to ten months for the year ended december  we also incurred additional advertising and other related marketing expenses of million related to additional sales activities incurred by our european subsidiary as we continue to pursue an increased market share in europe and our continue in our effort to grow our non oem commercial sales 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  will exceed spending levels incurred during due to our continued efforts to increase our market share and expand both our non oem commercial sales and channel partners 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is partially attributable to an increase in salaries  facility related expenses and all other expenses associated with our acquisition of chaparral in late february additionally  costs associated with the research and development of new product offerings increased by million and was partially offset by a reduction in costs of million related to our sata product which was released for sale early in the second quarter of 
table of contents we also incurred additional expenses of million related to test equipment and a loss on the disposal of fixed assets 
we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december  will exceed spending levels incurred during due to activities related to future product offerings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is partially attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of million which relates to our subsidiaries in europe  an increase of million related to the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase of million related to contract labor  and an increase of million in legal fees 
additionally  the year ended december  included a full year of compensation paid to our president  formerly our chief technology officer  that had been classified as research and development expense for the first nine months of the year ended december  we also incurred expenses of million related to severance and retirement expenses in our subsidiary in japan and million related to the implementation of a new erp software package which became operational in january we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  will exceed spending levels incurred during due to additional planned employees and post implementation expenses related to our new erp software package 
restructuring expenses in june  we negotiated an exit from our lease of the th floor of our former new york city office  which eliminated our related rent exposure 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction of approximately million to our restructuring reserve previously established in connection with the closure of our new york city office 
additionally  we have evaluated certain factors pertaining to our remaining sublease tenant  accordingly  during the three months ended june   we recorded an additional restructuring accrual of approximately million 
we are not aware of any further unresolved issues or additional liabilities that may result in a significant adjustment to restructuring expenses accrued as of december  in process research and development charges projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no future alternative uses exist 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
for the year ended december  we recorded an ipr d charge of million  in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
there were no similar charges for the year ended december  other income other income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million due to rising interest rates and a decrease in interest expense of approximately million as a result of the payoff in august of a million note payable that was assumed in connection with the acquisition of chaparral and the repayment and termination of our japanese credit facilities in the fourth quarter of income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the benefit was comprised of million attributed to a one time non cash elimination of valuation allowances 
table of contents associated with our us deferred tax assets offset by a million expense related to earnings for the year ended december  the income tax expense for the year ended december  was attributed to federal and state minimum tax liabilities as well as local and foreign taxes 
we recognized an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the income tax expense for the year ended december  was attributed to federal and state minimum tax liabilities as well as local and foreign taxes 
as of december   we reversed a valuation allowance on its us deferred tax assets totaling million 
based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of million  and a net income tax benefit of million 
this reversal is the result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not 
we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets are not accurate  we could be required to record additional reserves against deferred tax assets in future periods 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided for the foreign deferred tax assets based upon our assessment of the future realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets  as it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize these temporary differences 
as of december   we have federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in the tax years ending and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which approximately million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we also have state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending as a result of our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of artecon immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the internal revenue code in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual us income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual us income taxes  if any  would be insignificant 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to increased orders for our product from our channel partner  sun  which accounted for or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  total fibre channel units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  fibre channel units shipped for the year ended december   scsi units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  scsi units for the year ended december  in march  we announced that our existing oem partner agreement with sun was expanded to include new advanced technology storage products to be designed and engineered by us to sun s specifications

additionally  cost of goods sold increased approximately million due to the impact of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
the decrease in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to cost reductions related to production materials achieved during the year ended december  such cost reductions resulted mainly from the decreasing price of component parts due to competitive market factors  predetermined contractual cost reductions and the transition from soft to hard tooling as compared to the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of gross profit was attributable to greater volume of product sales during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflect cost reductions achieved during such cost reductions resulted mainly from the decreasing price of component parts due to competitive market factors  predetermined contractual cost reductions and the transition from soft to hard tooling

as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year we also have state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in as a result of the company s equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of the company s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of artecon immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the internal revenue code in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual us income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual us income taxes  if any  would be insignificant

for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to net income of million increased by the add back of depreciation and amortization of million and million loss on disposition of property and equipment  offset by a non cash benefit of million related to the reversal of valuation allowances 
table of contents previously established for us deferred income tax assets 
cash flow from operations reflects the negative impact of approximately million related to the management of certain payments to vendors and a million increase in prepaid and other current assets  due primarily to a million increase in vendor rebate receivables and million increase in receivables related to tenant improvement allowances 
cash provided from operations was positively impacted by the decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million  due to decreased revenue in and a million decrease in inventory due to our efforts to better manage our materials portion of our business

our japanese subsidiary previously had two lines of credit with tokyo mitsubishi bank and one line of credit with national life finance corporation in japan secured by its inventories 
as of november  all of the lines of credit relating to our japanese subsidiary described above were repaid and closed 
we intend to fund our japanese operations from cash on hand and working capital 
we presently expect cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months and to enable us to pursue acquisitions or significant capital improvements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from continued operations  our ability to manage our relationships with third party manufacturers  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands

recent accounting pronouncements as of december   we account for stock based compensation awards using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we record no compensation expense for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant

revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  and in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab no 
 relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
to stock compensation awards 
rather  sfas no 
r requires enterprises to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we will adopt sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
under this method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the fair value at the date of grant of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas as adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will impact our financial results in the future  as it is expected to significantly reduce our net income as we have not had significant stock based compensation expense in the recent past 
as of december   we had unamortized stock based compensation expense of million  of which  million is expected to be expensed in however  this amount does not reflect the expense associated with equity awards that are expected to be granted to employees in management is currently reviewing its alternatives for granting equity based awards and  while we expect to continue granting equity based awards to our employees  the type and amount of award is still under consideration 
accordingly  the overall effect of adopting this new standard on the financial results for has not yet been quantified 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
are disclosed elsewhere in this filing 
although such pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r  the provisions of these two statements differ in important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no

in march  the fasb issued interpretation number  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation which refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligation 
there was no effect of adoption of the statement on our results of operations or financial condition

the company adopted the provisions of fsp as it relates to these countries with no material impact on its financial statements 
the company will apply the guidance of fsp as it relates to the remaining european union member countries in which it operates when those countries have adopted the weee directive into law

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields and maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money 
table of contents market funds  certificates of deposit  us government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we currently do not hedge against interest rate exposure 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical  reasonably possible  near term change of basis points in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially impact the fair values of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  and for investment securities  the table presents related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and carrying values in thousands at december cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate total portfolio average interest rate we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest at a variable rate 
as of december   we had no balance under this line 
if we incur a balance under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the future
