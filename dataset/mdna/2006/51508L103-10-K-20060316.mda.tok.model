the property also features three towers containing  rooms  the largest number of guestrooms in downtown las vegas 
the golden nugget laughlin is located on acres on the colorado river with  square feet of gaming space and rooms 
the results of operations for these properties are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
during  we completed a series of relatively small acquisitions  including separate acquisitions of several well known individual upscale houston restaurants  ocean journey a acre aquarium complex in denver  colorado the holiday inn on the beach in galveston  texas  and the galveston flagship hotel subject to an existing lease  for an aggregate cash purchase price of all such acquisitions of approximately million  plus the assumption of an million non recourse long term note payable 
these acquisitions included certain future commitments as described in notes to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies in the paragraph titled building commitments 
the estimated cost of such future commitments are included in the contractual obligations table amounts under other long term obligations  that is included within this item the specialty growth division is primarily engaged in operating complementary entertainment and hospitality activities  such as miscellaneous beverage carts and various kiosks  amusement rides and games and some associated limited hotel properties  generally at locations in conjunction with our core restaurant operations 
the total assets  revenues  and operating profits of these complementary specialty business activities are considered not material to the overall business and below the threshold of a separate reportable business segment under sfas no 

table of contents we are in the business of operating restaurants  two casinos and the above mentioned complementary activities 
we do not engage in real estate operations other than those associated with the ownership and operation of our business

the chief executive officer  who is responsible for our operations  reviews and evaluates both core and non core business activities and results  and determines financial and management resource allocations and investments for all business activities 
the restaurant and gaming industries are intensely competitive and affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants or casinos may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants and casinos 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from other casinos in the markets in which we operate and from other mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local restaurant chains and casinos as well as local owner operated restaurants and casinos 
we also compete with other restaurants  retail establishments and gaming companies for restaurant and casino sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy 
in this report  we have made forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty  including without limitation  our ability to continue our expansion strategy  our ability to make projected capital expenditures  as well as potential acquisitions of other restaurants  restaurant concepts  gaming operations and lines of businesses in other sectors of the hospitality and entertainment industries  general market conditions  competition  and pricing

in  an income tax benefit of million was recognized from reversal of the valuation reserve attributable to tax assets deemed realizable and reduced accruals 
liquidity and capital resources in december  we refinanced our existing revolving credit facility and existing senior notes by entering into a new five year million bank credit facility and a six year million term loan 
the bank credit facility matures in december and the term loan matures in december interest on the bank credit facility is payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
interest on the term loan is payable quarterly at libor plus a financing spread 
the financing spread under the bank credit facility and the term loan is currently and  respectively  for libor borrowings and and for base rate borrowings 
as of december   we had approximately million available under the existing credit facility for expansion and working capital purposes 
concurrent with the closing of the bank credit facility and term loan in december  we also issued million in senior notes through a private placement offering 
the senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the company and mature december interest is payable semi annually at 
on june   we completed an exchange offering whereby substantially all of the senior notes issued under the private placement were exchanged for senior notes registered under the securities act of net proceeds from the bank credit facility and senior notes totaled million and were used to repay all outstanding liabilities under the existing credit facility and senior notes 
these debt repayments resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of the bank credit facility and term loan are secured by substantially all real and personal property of subsidiaries and governed by certain financial covenants  including minimum fixed charge  net worth  and our financial leverage ratios as well as limitations on dividend payments  capital expenditures and other restricted payments as defined in the agreements 
in october  we refinanced a previous bank credit facility by issuing long term notes totaling million through a private placement of debt and amending and extending the existing bank credit facility to a four year million revolving credit facility the former bank credit facility later increased to million 
the long term notes had maturities ranging from october through october  and the former bank credit facility matured in october interest on the long term notes was paid quarterly at an average rate of 
interest on the former bank credit facility was payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
the former bank credit facility  long term notes  and all future related liabilities were paid down in full with the proceeds from the december refinancing 
a wholly owned subsidiary of ours assumed an million non recourse  long term note payable due may in connection with an asset purchase in march principal and interest payments under this note aggregate  monthly 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of common stock 
in september  we authorized an open market stock repurchase program for million 
in october  we authorized a million stock repurchase program 
in  we authorized a million stock repurchase program 
we expect to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock 
working capital decreased from a surplus of million as of december  to million deficit as of december  primarily due to the purchase of the golden nugget hotels and casinos and repurchase of our common stock during cash flow to fund future operations  new restaurant development  and acquisitions will be generated from operations  available capacity under the current bank credit facility and additional financing  if appropriate 

table of contents in  we spent million to acquire gn and million on capital expenditures including opening new units and acquiring million in land for future development 
in  we expect to spend approximately million  including opening units and spending million in to renovate the golden nugget hotel and casino in downtown las vegas  nevada followed by a casino expansion and new hotel tower in as of december   we had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital  the bank credit facility and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
our obligations include off balance sheet arrangements whereby the liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and standby letters of credit are not fully reflected in our balance sheets 
contractual obligations in thousands thereafter long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments in thousands thereafter line of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments in connection with our purchase of an interest in the restaurant concept t rex in february  we have committed to spend an estimated million during  and to complete one t rex restaurant in kansas city  kansas  construct one t rex restaurant as well as an asian themed restaurant in walt disney world s florida theme parks and construct one additional t rex restaurant in the northeast 
from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  entertainment including gaming  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  as a primary result of establishing long term borrowings  we will incur higher interest expense in the future 
however  we have mitigated a portion of the higher interest expense by entering into fair value hedges with a notional amount of million  whereby we swapped higher fixed interest rates of the senior notes due for floating interest rates equal to six month libor plus a financing spread of to 
since april  we have paid an annual per share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
we increased the annual dividend to per share in april seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
joe s crab shack restaurants tend to experience even greater seasonality and sensitivity to weather than our other restaurant concepts 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 

table of contents critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually using estimates of future operating results 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 
we operate approximately properties and periodically we expect to experience unanticipated individual unit deterioration in revenues and profitability  on a short term and occasionally longer term basis 
when such events occur and we determine that the associated assets are impaired  we will record an asset impairment expense in the quarter such determination is made 
due to our average restaurant net investment cost  generally excluding the owned land component  of approximately million  such amounts could be significant when and if they occur 
however  such asset impairment expense does not affect our financial liquidity  and is usually excluded from many valuation model calculations 
we maintain a large deductible insurance policy related to property  general liability and workers compensation coverage 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit our per occurrence cash outlay 
accrued expenses and other liabilities include estimated costs to settle unpaid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims using actuarial methodologies 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
we regularly assess the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets based on forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented and adjust the related valuation allowance if necessary 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
we follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and as such do not record compensation expense related to amounts outstanding 
effective with the quarter ending march   we will expense compensation related to stock options in accordance with sfas r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  costs to settle unpaid claims and the valuation of inventory 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates and services

the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  adoption of fsp is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in labor costs  including expected future increases in federal minimum wages  energy costs  and land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including risks related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings at an average interest rate of 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
in connection with the senior notes due  we entered into two interest swap agreements with the objective of managing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense 
the agreements were effective december and march  and mature in december for an aggregate notional amount of million 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt and other obligations outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts
