item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading north american manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and pet care markets  and a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
we recently announced that we entered into a purchase agreement with amcor to purchase amcor s white cap closures business in europe  southeast asia and south america  which would make us a leading manufacturer worldwide of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations at compounded annual rates of percent and percent  respectively  over the past ten years  largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
however  in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we expect to use our cash flow for other permitted purposes  such as to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends to our stockholders 
sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past eighteen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service 
table of contents and value added features such as our quick top easy open ends 
we anticipate that the market will decline slightly in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top easy open end  representing an increase in unit sales of this value added feature of percent since we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sixfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
for example  following our acquisition in march of silgan closures  we implemented rationalization and integration plans to consolidate certain administrative functions of this business with our metal food container business and to close a higher cost manufacturing facility 
we substantially completed these plans in and significantly improved the profitability of this business 
additionally  with our acquisition in april of the can manufacturing business of pacific coast  we were able to successfully rationalize and consolidate this business into our existing metal food container facilities and realized cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies as a result 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers such as our metal food container supply agreements with our three largest customers  nestl renewed through for approximately half of our sales under these agreements  del monte renewed through and campbell renewed through 
we estimate that approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales in and a majority of our projected plastic container sales in will be under multi year arrangements 
over the last couple of years  our plastic container business began to experience increased competitive pressures from new market entrants focused on larger customers in value added markets 
as a result  our plastic container business extended the term of several major supply agreements with various customers  but at lower prices  and elected not to meet competitive bids for some products 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in each of and  the steel industry in the united states announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher steel costs 
for our non contract customers  we also increased prices to pass through higher steel costs 

table of contents in the second half of  the gulf coast experienced unforeseen hurricane activity which disrupted resin supply 
consequently  many resin suppliers  including many of our resin suppliers  declared force majeure under their supply arrangements and implemented sales volume control initiatives 
as a result  our plastic container business declared force majeure under certain of its contracts 
despite these challenges  our plastic container business was able to procure sufficient quantities of resins to meet substantially all of its customer needs  although at higher prices 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our cash flow for other permitted purposes  such as to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends to our stockholders 
in  we announced that in the absence of acquisitions we intended to focus on reducing our debt and expected to repay million of debt over the three year period from through in  we exceeded our goal by completing a two year cumulative debt reduction totaling million 
in  we took advantage of favorable debt markets and refinanced our previous senior secured credit facility with the credit agreement 
as a result of this refinancing  among other things  we lowered our interest rate spreads  increased our ability to incur additional bank debt with a new million uncommitted incremental loan facility and increased our flexibility under our bank covenants 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
consistent with our financial strategy  we intend to finance our acquisition of white cap with debt 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt was percent of our income from operations 
this was lower than historic levels primarily as a result of lower average borrowings due to our debt reduction program and lower interest rate spreads from our june bank debt refinancing  offset by a higher average cost of borrowings resulting from rising interest rates 
our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt was percent and percent of our income from operations for and  respectively 

table of contents acquisitions in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of thatcher tubes  a privately held manufacturer and marketer of decorated plastic tubes serving primarily the personal care industry 
including additional production capacity installed shortly before the acquisition  the purchase price for the assets was approximately million in cash 
thatcher tubes operates as part of our plastic container business and extends our personal care business into decorated plastic tubes 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in silgan closures that we did not already own for approximately million in cash 
additionally  we refinanced debt of silgan closures in the amount of approximately million and purchased equipment subject to a third party lease for approximately million 
the business is a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
the business operates as part of our metal food container business 
in april  we acquired pcp can manufacturing  inc  or pacific coast can  a subsidiary of pacific coast  which self manufactured a majority of its metal food container requirements 
this acquisition continued the trend of food processors selling their metal food container manufacturing businesses 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash  including approximately million for inventory 
as part of the transaction  we entered into a ten year supply agreement with pacific coast under which pacific coast has agreed to purchase from us substantially all of its metal food container requirements

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
income from operations in increased by million as compared to and operating margin increased to percent from percent for the same periods 
these increases resulted primarily from productivity improvements and continued benefits from the rationalization and integration of manufacturing facilities 
net income in increased million to million in our results include a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt primarily as the result of the refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility 
we used strong cash flows from operations to pay down million of debt during  amounting to a cumulative two year debt reduction of million 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs in both the metal food container and plastic container businesses  partially offset by lower volumes in food cans and plastic containers 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily the result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material and other inflationary costs and improved unit volumes in the closures product line  partially offset by lower food can volumes 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher average selling prices due to price increases in response to higher resin costs  partially offset by lower unit volumes 
gross profit 
the slight increase in gross profit margin of percentage points in as compared to was principally due to the reasons discussed below in income from operations 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were percentage points higher in as compared to  primarily as a result of a benefit in of million from a litigation settlement reached with an equipment supplier and additional tax and audit professional fees incurred in that are included in corporate expense 
income from operations

we recorded rationalization charges totaling million in and million in income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were principally due to the positive performance in the closures product line as a result of higher unit volumes  continued benefits from rationalization and integration activities and the combination of productivity benefits from higher capital spending over the last several years as well as price increases in response to inflationary pressures 
these positive factors were partially offset by increases in other manufacturing costs  particularly energy costs  and lower unit volumes in the food can business 
income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the decreases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily as a result of lower unit volumes  increased energy costs and higher employee benefit costs  as well as the million benefit in from a litigation settlement 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for was million  a decrease of million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings as a result of our debt reduction initiative and lower interest rate spreads from the june refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility  partially offset by a higher average cost of borrowings resulting from rising interest rates

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of the full year inclusion of silgan closures which was acquired in march and the effect of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
income from operations in increased by million as compared to and operating margin in increased by percentage points as compared to these increases resulted primarily from the post rationalization performance of silgan closures  the continued conversion to quick top easy open ends and the incurrence of rationalization charges of million in net income in of million increased by million as compared to primarily as a result of the 
table of contents above referenced improvements in income from operations  significantly reduced interest expense attributable to the debt refinancing in late and a lower average cost of borrowings  and a non cash  pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in we used strong cash flows from operations in to pay down million of debt during the year 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher net sales of the metal food container business due to the acquisition of silgan closures in march and the effect of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs in both the metal food container and plastic container businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the performance and full year inclusion of the silgan closures business  as well as higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased metal costs and continued customer conversion to higher value added products 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased resin costs  partially offset by the effect of prior year price concessions and a less favorable mix of products sold due primarily to weak demand from certain customers in the personal care market 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit margin of percentage points in as compared to was principally due to the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly in as compared to as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were percentage points lower in as compared to  primarily as a result of a benefit of million from a litigation settlement reached with an equipment supplier and the benefits of integrating the administrative functions of the silgan closures operations into our metal food container business 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
we recorded rationalization charges totaling million in and million in income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were principally due to the strong post rationalization performance and full year inclusion of the results of the silgan closures business and increased sales of quick top easy open ends for which we had made significant capital investment over the past several years 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and increases in other manufacturing costs 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods

in  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of a late year debt refinancing 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was principally due to valuation allowances established for certain state net operating loss carryovers and credits 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments  including our credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
in  we entered into an million senior secured credit facility  or the credit facility  that provided us with million of a term loans  million of b term loans and revolving loans of up to million  as well as a million incremental term loan facility 
the credit facility required scheduled repayments in annual installments and matured in in march  we borrowed million of incremental term loans under the credit facility  primarily to finance the acquisitions of silgan closures and thatcher tubes 
in the fourth quarter of  we amended the credit facility and borrowed an additional million of incremental term loans thereunder to  among other things  redeem a portion of our senior subordinated debentures due  or the debentures 
in each of and  we repaid scheduled term loan installments under the credit facility of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we utilized excess cash flows to voluntarily prepay an additional million of term loans under the credit facility 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our credit facility by entering into the new billion credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided us with million of a term loans and million of b term loans  and provides us with a revolving loan facility of up to million 
under the credit agreement  we may use revolving loans for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the credit agreement also provides us with an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to an additional million  which may be used to finance acquisitions and for other permitted purposes 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
on december   we amended our credit agreement to  among other things  add our wholly owned canadian subsidiaries as borrowers under our credit agreement for cdn 
million of incremental term loans which term loans did not reduce the million uncommitted incremental loan facility and for up to cdn 
million of revolving loans under the revolving loan facility thereunder 
the proceeds from the incremental term loans were used primarily to repatriate earnings of our canadian subsidiaries in connection with the american jobs creation act 
during  we repaid scheduled installments of million of b term loans under the credit agreement 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we utilized excess cash flows to voluntarily prepay million of a term loans and million of b term loans under the credit agreement 
in  we used cash from operations of million  increases in outstanding checks of million  cash balances of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and proceeds from asset sales of million to fund net payments of debt of million  capital expenditures of million  dividends paid on common stock of million and debt issuance costs of million 

table of contents in  we used cash from operations of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and increases in outstanding checks of million to fund capital expenditures of million  payments of scheduled debt installments of million and voluntary debt prepayments of million under our credit facility  net repayments of revolving loans of million  dividends paid on common stock of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net decreased million due to the timing of cash collections from our customers 
trade accounts payable increased million due to the timing of payments and price increases of raw material purchases 
in  we used cash from incremental term loan borrowings of million  cash from operations of million  proceeds from the issuance of the notes of million  cash balances of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  increases in outstanding checks of million  proceeds from asset sales of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to redeem the debentures for million  purchase businesses for million  fund capital expenditures of million  repay term loans under our credit facility of million and pay debt issuance costs of million

the cash payments for dividends in and totaled million and million  respectively 
in march  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  this represents a percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend 
the cash payment for this quarterly dividend is expected to be approximately million 
revolving loans may be used for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed over the life of our credit agreement until their final maturity 
at december  and  there were no revolving loans outstanding 
after taking into account letters of credit of million  amounts available under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement were million on december  because we sell metal containers used in the fruit and vegetable packing process  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  and  the average amount of revolving loans outstanding  including seasonal borrowings  was million  million and million  respectively  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the highest amount of such borrowings was million  million and million  respectively 
our peak borrowings in included million of revolving loans borrowed under our credit agreement to repay term loans in connection with the june refinancing of our credit facility 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
consistent with our financial strategy  we intend to finance our acquisition of white cap through borrowings under our credit agreement or the issuance of new senior subordinated notes by us or one of our subsidiaries  or a combination thereof 
the purchase price for this acquisition is million  subject to adjustments for working capital  included cash at a discounted price  assumed debt and debt owing to the business and certain other adjustments 
we have received a commitment from deutsche bank ag new york branch  the administrative agent under our credit agreement  for a new incremental term loan of up to 
table of contents million under our credit agreement  and we could utilize revolving loans under our credit agreement to fund the balance of the purchase price plus fees and expenses 
we also may incur additional debt to fund the operating needs of white cap 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years not taking into account the acquisition of white cap will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of to million  principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in and million in  cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  and payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which may increase annually thereafter 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
the credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of our interest on fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of our interest on variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current tax law  there are no minimum required contributions to our pension plans in however  this is subject to change based on current tax proposals before congress  as well as in the event that asset performance is significantly below the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
during  although we had no minimum required contributions  we made pension contributions of million 
at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate was exchanged for fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent 
at december   the 
table of contents aggregate notional principal amounts of these agreements was million  with million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in  and million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in each of and depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges and acquisition reserves in february  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our valencia  california plastic container manufacturing facility in the second quarter of the plan includes the termination of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs 
a rationalization charge of approximately million for employee severance and benefits and approximately million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets will be recognized in the first quarter of for these events 
additional costs of approximately million related primarily to plant exit costs are expected to be recognized in the remainder of total cash expenditures related to this rationalization of approximately million are expected primarily in during  we approved and announced to employees a plan to relocate the operations of one of our mississauga  ontario plastic container manufacturing facilities to our other operating facilities 
this decision resulted in charges to earnings of million  which consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets and million for employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs 
the relocation of operations has been substantially completed 
through december  we made cash payments of million related to relocating this facility 
cash payments related to these reserves are expected through for employee severance and benefits costs 
during  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our benton harbor  michigan metal food container manufacturing facility and another operation 
this decision resulted in a charge to earnings during of million  of which million was for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
total cash payments required for the plan of million were expended in during  we established acquisition reserves in connection with our purchases of thatcher tubes  silgan closures and pacific coast can aggregating approximately million  recorded pursuant to plans that we began to assess and formulate at the date of the acquisitions 
during  we finalized these plans and reduced the related acquisition reserves by approximately million 
these plans included exiting the lodi  california metal food container manufacturing facility  the chicago  illinois and queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facilities and the culiacan  mexico plastic container manufacturing facility  as well as the consolidation of certain administrative functions of the acquired businesses 
all of these facilities have ceased manufacturing operations and required cash payments of million and million for employee severance and benefits and plant exist costs  respectively  are substantially complete 
during  we approved and announced to employees plans to exit our norwalk  connecticut and anaheim  california plastic container manufacturing facilities and our queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facility  as well as to consolidate certain administrative functions of the silgan closures business 
these plans included the termination of approximately plant employees and other related exit costs 
these decisions resulted in a charge to earnings of million million for the metal food container business and million for the plastic container business in  which consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  million for employee severance and benefits costs and million for plant exit costs 
during  additional rationalization charges of million were recorded related to these plans million for the metal food container business and million for the plastic container business 
since inception  a total of million and million has been expended for employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs  respectively  and million has been recorded for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
in  we bought out our lease 
table of contents obligation for million and reversed the remaining lease obligation reserve of million 
cash payments related to these reserves are substantially complete 
under our rationalization and acquisition plans  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional cash spending is not expected to be significant for these plans 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities in our business  including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings 
we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 
in line with our ongoing evaluation  we are currently reviewing certain facilities for potential rationalization actions which may result in cash expenditures and charges to our earnings 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for deferred income taxes  pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
at december   silgan can had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  that expire between and  for which no valuation allowance has been established 
these nols are available to offset future taxable income of silgan can 
we believe that it is more likely than not that these nols will be available to reduce future income tax liabilities based on the estimated future taxable income of silgan can and the reversal of temporary differences in future periods 
current levels of silgan can pre tax earnings are sufficient to generate the taxable income required to realize our deferred tax assets 
we would reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it became more likely than not that a portion of these nols would not be utilized 
if a valuation allowance were established  additional expense would be recorded within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which that determination was made 
silgan equipment company  or silgan equipment  had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of federal nols that expire in  which have been fully reserved for through purchase accounting 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we reduced our discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our 
table of contents pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we reduced the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets from percent to percent 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances 
sfas no

to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that public companies recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  utilizing the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow activity  rather than as an operating cash flow activity as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
fsp no 
r provides an 
table of contents elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no

this election is available for adoption until january  we are currently evaluating this transition method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have limited foreign currency risk associated primarily with our canadian operations and risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency 
table of contents and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing cost 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our total debt  respectively 
we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under the credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  we do not conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  our foreign activities are conducted primarily in canada 
since we do not currently have significant foreign operations  we have not found it necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we recently announced that we entered into a purchase agreement with amcor to purchase amcor s white cap closures business in europe  southeast asia and south america  which would make us a leading manufacturer worldwide of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
upon our acquisition of white cap  we will have significant foreign operations in many foreign countries and  therefore  may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
commodity pricing risk we purchase commodities for our products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during and  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read notes 
table of contents and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
subsequent to december   we entered into additional natural gas swap agreements to hedge an additional percent and percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices in and  respectively 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account our natural gas swap agreements
