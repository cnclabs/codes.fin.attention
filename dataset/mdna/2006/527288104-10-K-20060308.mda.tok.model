manufacturing idaho timber business description in may  the company acquired idaho timber for total cash consideration of  including working capital adjustments and expenses 
idaho timber is headquartered in boise  idaho and is engaged in the manufacture and or distribution of various wood products 
idaho timber s principal product lines include remanufacturing of dimension lumber  remanufacturing  bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers  and producing of radius edge  pine decking 
idaho timber also manufactures or distributes a number of other specialty wood products 
idaho timber has over years of operating experience in its industry 
remanufactured dimension lumber is idaho timber s largest product line 
dimension lumber is used for general construction and home improvement  remodeling and repair projects  the demand for which is normally a function of housing starts and home size 
all dimension lumber is assigned a quality grade  based on the imperfections in the wood  and higher grade lumber is sold at a higher price than lower grade lumber 
idaho timber purchases low grade dimension lumber from sawmills located in north america and europe and upgrades it into higher grade dimension lumber products 
the remanufacturing process includes ripping  trimming and planing lumber to reduce imperfections and produce a variety of lumber sizes 
these products are produced at plants located in florida  north carolina  texas  kansas  idaho and new mexico 
each plant distributes its product primarily by truck to lumber yards and contractors within a mile shipping radius from the plant site 
idaho timber s next largest product line is home center board products  which are principally sold to large home improvement retailers 
idaho timber purchases high grade boards from sawmills in the western united states  south america and new zealand primarily pine but other wood species are also used  performs minor re work on those boards to upgrade the quality  and then packages and bar codes those boards according to customer specifications 
services provided include managing delivery to off site inventory positions at customer owned distribution centers near retail locations so that adequate stock is available for the customers to draw upon when needed 
production takes place in owned plants in idaho and montana  and goods are shipped nationwide by rail and truck to customer owned distribution centers 
the sale is not completed and revenue is not recognized until the customer takes the product from the distribution center 
idaho timber also operates a sawmill in arkansas that produces radius edge  pine decking cut to a variety of lengths 
rights to cut timber are purchased from private land owners located near the sawmill  known as timber deeds  and idaho timber employs third party contractors to cut the timber and transport the logs to the sawmill 
logs are also acquired in the spot market gate logs when trucks loaded with logs arrive at the sawmill  are inspected for quality and purchased if an agreement can be reached on price 
idaho timber performs traditional sawmill processes cutting  drying and planing to manufacture the final product 
the product is shipped to various regions throughout the central and eastern parts of the united states via truck and rail to lumber treaters and others for resale to the final consumer 
idaho timber s profitability is dependent upon its ability to manage manufacturing costs and process efficiency  minimize capital expenditures through the purchase of used  lower cost equipment and repairing its existing equipment  and effective management of the spread between what it pays for dimension lumber and boards and the selling prices of the remanufactured products 
selling prices for remanufactured products may rise quicker than supplier prices in strong markets creating greater spread  however  during periods of declining product demand and reduced selling prices  supply price declines may lag behind resulting in lower spreads 
idaho timber s business is generally not seasonal  except in those locations that have weather related construction slowdowns 
the dimension lumber product does not require significant build up of inventory to cover peak periods of activity  nor are there any other unusually significant needs for working capital 
home center board products experience a longer cycle to convert raw material to product sales due to cross country shipping and consignment inventory programs  resulting in an investment in working capital 
working capital requirements are greater for the sawmill operation 
in addition to cash outlays for timber deeds  the sawmill will have a seasonal build up of log inventory 
idaho timber owns nine plants  one sawmill that principally produces decking products and one sawmill that produces split rail fencing 
these eleven facilities in the aggregate have approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space  covering approximately acres 
two plants are principally dedicated to home center board products and the remaining plants principally produce remanufactured dimension lumber products 
all plant locations can produce and distribute specialty wood products 
idaho timber has the capacity to ship approximately million board feet per month  during actual shipments averaged approximately million board feet per month 
idaho timber believes that its diverse remanufacturing  sawmill  and distribution operations provide it with purchasing power to secure sources of supply from multiple suppliers while minimizing freight costs 
idaho timber s diverse geographic footprint also mitigates geographic concentration risk 
sales and marketing idaho timber primarily markets to local  regional and national lumber retailers for its dimension lumber products  home improvement centers for its home center board products and decking treaters for its sawmill product  and other resellers of home construction materials 
demand for its products is dependent  in part  upon the strength of the u 
s housing market and the do it yourself home improvement market which are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
its success in attracting and retaining customers depends in large part on its ability to provide quicker delivery of specified customer products than its competitors 
for dimension lumber products  sales are primarily generated at each of the plants  with a dedicated sales force located in the same geographic region as the customers the plant serves 
board and decking products are sold and managed centrally 
the home center board product is heavily dependent on two customers  lowe s and the home depot  which account for approximately of that product line 
the combined revenue of these two customers was of idaho timber s total revenue for the period from acquisition to december  the customer base for the dimension lumber business is much less concentrated  no customer accounts for more than of revenue 
idaho timber s sales are somewhat concentrated in regions where its facilities are located  with the largest being florida   north carolina   and texas  
competition idaho timber sells commodity products  and operates in an industry that is currently oversupplied and very competitive 
idaho timber competes against domestic and foreign sawmills and intermediate distributors for its dimension lumber and decking products 
in some cases  idaho timber competes on a limited basis with the same sawmills that are a source of supply of low grade dimension lumber 
foreign suppliers have been growing their sales in the us market  particularly european competitors  which has added to the current oversupply condition in the industry and may continue to do so 
the home center board business has many competitors  and suppliers to large home centers are always under pressure to reduce prices 
idaho timber also competes for raw material purchases needed for its remanufactured dimension lumber and home center board products  and in the past the availability and pricing of certain raw materials has been adversely affected by import duties tariffs imposed on canadian imports  the largest source of these supplies 
a decades old trade dispute between the us and canada resurfaced with the expiration of the softwood lumber agreement on march  the dispute involves claims that lumber from government owned land in canada is subsidized and sold into the us market for less than fair value  the effect of which is to injure or threaten to injure us competitors 
in the past  the us has argued for the right to impose extra duties to prevent cheap canadian wood from harming us manufacturers 
however  the north american free trade agreement nafta review panel rejected claims that us lumber producers had suffered damage as a result of canadian imports 
on september   the us international trade commission complied with the nafta ruling and issued a statement saying that the us lumber industry is not threatened by canadian softwood imports  however  the commission expressed some disagreement with the panel s decision 
there have been a number of challenges and appeals made through various channels attempting to reverse nafta s decision 
currently  restrictions on canadian imports are not adversely affecting idaho timber s operations  however  if tariffs increase or import limitations are imposed in the future  it is possible that raw material costs could increase or supplies could be constrained 
idaho timber is examining alternative sources of supply to increase its raw material purchasing flexibility 
idaho timber s manufacturing process is very labor intensive  and its labor force is not unionized 
idaho timber s low cost labor force allows it to be competitive and flexible in its operating activities  however  its labor force is in high demand in its own industry and also from non industry employers 
if idaho timber is unable to continue to attract and retain a cost efficient labor force  sales volumes and profitability could suffer 
government regulation lumber and decking are identified at idaho timber facilities with a grade stamp that shows the grade  moisture content  mill number  species and grading agency 
all lumber is graded in compliance with the national grading rule for dimension lumber  which is published by the us department of commerce 
idaho timber facilities are subject to regular inspection by agencies approved by the american lumber standards committee 
idaho timber believes that its procedure for grading lumber is highly accurate  however  the company could be exposed to product liability claims if it can be demonstrated its products are inappropriately rated 
currently  idaho timber does not have any material product liability claims outstanding 
since idaho timber s sawmills do not treat its wood with chemicals  and since timber deeds purchased from private land owners do not impose a re planting obligation  idaho timber does not have any unusual environmental compliance issues 
plastics manufacturing business description through its plastics division  the company manufactures and markets lightweight plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including  among other things  building and construction  erosion control  agriculture  packaging  carpet padding  filtration and consumer products 
the products are primarily used to add strength to other materials or act as barriers  such as warning fences and crop protection from birds 
the plastics division is a market leader in netting products used in carpet cushion  erosion control  nonwoven reinforcement and crop protection 
in february  the company acquired the assets of nsw for approximately  thereby increasing its mix of products and customer base 
nsw has a manufacturing and distribution facility in roanoke  virginia  and has generated revenues of approximately  for the period from acquisition to december  although the company has integrated certain of nsw s operating activities into its own  principally in the administration and raw materials purchasing areas  nsw s manufacturing facility will continue as a stand alone operation 
products manufactured by nsw include produce and packaging nets  header label bags  case liners and heavy weight nets for drainage and erosion control purposes 
certain of the division s products are proprietary  protected by patents and or trade secrets 
the company holds patents on certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes it uses and on applications thereof 
the company believes that the expiration of these patents  individually or in the aggregate  is unlikely to have a material effect on the plastics division 
sales and marketing plastics manufacturing revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
products are marketed both domestically and internationally  with approximately of revenues generated by customers in europe  latin america  japan and australia 
products are sold primarily through an employee sales force  located in the united states and europe 
new product development focuses on market niches where the division s proprietary technology and expertise can lead to sustainable competitive economic advantages 
historically  this targeted product development generally has been carried out in partnership with a prospective customer or industry where the value of the product has been recognized 
the plastics division is now also focusing on developing products which provide an upgrade to a current product used by an existing customer 
over the last several years  the plastics division has spent approximately to of annual sales on the development and marketing of new products and new applications of existing products 
competition the plastics division is subject to domestic and international competition  generally on the basis of price  service and quality 
additionally  certain products are dependent on cyclical industries  including the construction industry 
the cost of the principal raw material used in its products  polypropylene  has increased by approximately from the division has been able to raise prices to its customers during this period but the contribution margin percentage has dropped by as a result of higher raw material costs 
high oil and natural gas prices along with high capacity utilization in the polypropylene industry are expected to keep raw material costs higher than historical levels for the next few years 
the plastics division has had excess manufacturing capacity  principally in its belgium facility which became operational during utilization of this capacity has taken longer than anticipated primarily due to the loss of a major customer for whom the facility was expected to produce products 
however  operating results at the facility have improved  as sales grew in as compared to and the business achieved positive cash flow during in addition  manufacturing production for customers in australia and asia has been moved away from domestic facilities to the belgium facility  thereby enabling the domestic facilities to meet sales growth 
in october  the plastics division acquired the manufacturing assets of a competitor for approximately  and relocated and installed the equipment in the belgium facility 
the asset acquisition is expected to increase sales in the filtration  packaging and agricultural markets at the belgium facility 
healthcare services business description established in  symphony provides post acute healthcare services including contract therapy  long term care consulting and temporary staffing to skilled nursing facilities  hospitals  sub acute care centers  assisted living facilities  schools and other healthcare providers 
symphony currently operates in states  providing services at approximately  locations through its employee workforce of approximately  part time and full time skilled healthcare professionals excluding temporary personnel 
the businesses owned by symphony operate under the names rehabworks  vta management services  vta staffing services  nurseworks and polaris group 
the company has consolidated symphony in its financial statements since it was acquired in september the principal services offered by symphony are described below 
o contract therapy services physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech pathology services provided to various health care providers and schools 
services include compliance and clinical training  recruitment  orientation and staffing  management information and reimbursement expertise 
o healthcare staffing services placement of temporary healthcare professionals in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities generally ranging from one day to week assignments 
o consulting services these services assist healthcare providers in managing medicare reimbursement to ensure that systems and procedures are in place to manage costs and cash flow 
when determining how to meet their rehabilitation therapy and healthcare staffing needs  healthcare providers are faced with an in source or outsource decision  to either manage the rehabilitation therapy unit in house or to contract the service to an outside vendor 
as healthcare expenditures in the us have continued to increase  healthcare providers have experienced increased cost reduction pressures as a result of managed care and the implementation of prospective payment systems  where fixed fee schedules are set by the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
symphony s services give its customers increased flexibility in managing staffing levels and enables them to reduce their overall costs by converting a fixed cost into a variable cost 
contract therapy is available on a full time  part time and on call basis  and can be customized at each location according to the particular needs of a facility or patient 
contract therapy services also include full therapy program management with a full time program manager who is also a therapist and two to four professionals trained in physical and occupational therapy or speech language pathology 
symphony generally bills its customers either on the basis of a negotiated patient per diem rate or a negotiated fee schedule based on the type of service rendered 
symphony is also the largest provider of therapy services to the department of education of new york city 
symphony s revenues and growth are affected by trends and developments in healthcare spending  which has been increasing at an accelerated rate over the past five years 
demographic considerations also affect the amount spent on healthcare 
due to the increasing life expectancy of americans  the number of people aged years or older has been growing and is expected to increase in the future 
these trends  combined with the need for healthcare providers to find more cost effective means to deliver their services  may encourage healthcare providers to use the services offered by symphony and its competitors 
competition the contract therapy and healthcare staffing services businesses compete in national  regional and local markets with full service staffing companies and with specialized staffing agencies 
the program management services business competes with companies that may offer one or more of the same services and with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities that do not choose to outsource these services 
the managed inpatient units and outpatient programs are in highly competitive markets and compete for patients with other hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
there is a significant shortage of skilled healthcare professionals who provide symphony s services  and symphony s revenues are dependent on its ability to attract  develop and retain qualified therapists and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of customers 
symphony competes for healthcare staffing personnel  with other healthcare companies  as well as actual and potential customers  some of whom seek to fill positions with either regular or temporary employees 
government regulation healthcare providers are subject to a complex array of federal  state and local regulations which include but are not limited to medicare and medicaid regulations  licensure regulations  fraud and abuse regulations  as well as regulations regarding the confidentiality and security of health related information 
if symphony fails to comply with these laws it can result in civil penalties  criminal penalties and or exclusion from participation with programs such as medicare and medicaid 
failure of symphony s customers to meet regulatory requirements could have an adverse impact on its business 
symphony s customers are subject to state licensure and medicare certification requirements with respect to their facilities and healthcare professionals 
symphony is also subject to these requirements when it is the direct provider of the service 
systems are in place to assure that these requirements are met before symphony s healthcare professionals treat patients 
in most instances  customers participate in the medicare and medicaid programs as do certain of symphony s outpatient therapy facilities 
as such  they are subject to medicare and medicaid s regulations regarding quality of care  qualifications of personnel  adequacy of physical plant  as well as billing and payment regulations 
these regulations are written  published and administered by the cms and are monitored for compliance 
various federal and state laws prohibit the knowing and willful submission of false claims or fraudulent claims to obtain payment from medicare  medicaid or other government programs 
the federal anti kickback statute also prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying  offering  receiving or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase  lease  order  arrange for or recommend services or goods covered by medicare  medicaid or other government healthcare programs 
the balanced budget act of mandated a medicare part a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities based on the category of patient care under the resource utilization group classifications rugs established by cms 
the prospective payment system and consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities final rule refined the rugs system to more appropriately reimburse providers for patients requiring extensive nursing and rehabilitative services 
nine new categories were added and the nursing case mix index was shifted such that the nursing component of the per diem increased  while the rehab component the services symphony provides remained unchanged 
to the extent that symphony s customer contracts link billing for services with the rugs classification  revenues could be adversely impacted even though a patient may require the same level of care 
although symphony has successfully renegotiated many of its contracts with respect to this matter  part a revenues for certain customers could decline 
on january   most medicare part b therapy services became subject to an annual limitation per beneficiary of  for physical therapy and speech language pathology and  for occupational therapy services 
however  the deficit budget reconciliation act that was enacted in february mandated the development of an exception process to permit services above these limitations for services deemed medically appropriate  retroactive to january  on february   cms published three change request transmittals guidance  which detail the process by which beneficiaries may obtain exceptions to the cap limitation 
the process is to be fully implemented no later than march  under the guidance cms published  the majority of symphony s patients will qualify for an automatic exception to the therapy cap limits 
those who do not qualify for the automatic exception are still eligible to obtain a manual exception  subject to cms approval 
while the exception process was under development  it created uncertainty among symphony s staff and customers which limited symphony s services to part b patients 
symphony is currently training operating and clinical staff on the new exception process  so that services can be provided when medically necessary 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of is designed to improve efficiency in healthcare delivery by standardizing electronic data interchange and by protecting the confidentiality and security of an individual s health data by setting and enforcing national standards of practice 
virtually all healthcare providers are affected by the law  which consists of three primary areas  standards for electronic transactions  privacy and security 
symphony is currently in compliance with these standards 
telecommunications acquisition the company purchased all of atx s debt obligations under its senior secured credit facility for  in december  and atx commenced a voluntary chapter case to reorganize its financial affairs shortly thereafter 
the bankruptcy plan the plan of atx was confirmed by the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york and became effective on april  as contemplated by the plan  in exchange for its investment in the credit facility the company received approximately of the new common stock of the reorganized atx  a new  senior secured note  and the company provided atx with  of additional financing

business atx is an integrated communications provider that offers customers a full range of communications services  including local and long distance telephone services  data and internet services  web development  collocation and managed services 
additionally  atx provides conference calling  travel services  enhanced fax and web based billing 
atx s target market is small to medium sized enterprises located in the mid atlantic region of the us the telecommunications act of the telecom act established a framework for creating competition in the local and long distance telecommunications markets 
at that time  most local markets received services from one dominant local service provider  known as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec  who typically owned the entire infrastructure necessary to provide local telecommunication services to businesses and consumers 
as a result of the telecom act  atx and others were able to use or purchase various components of an ilec s network and infrastructure  referred to as unbundled network elements une s  unbundled network element platform une p and enhanced extended loops eel s  at favorable cost based rates that were subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission fcc 
une p is a combination of a loop the part of an ilec s telephone network that connects their central office to a customer  local switching and transport 
eels are typically a combination of unes  loops and local transport that atx uses to provide service to its customers 
atx  which is known as a competitive local exchange carrier clec  would not be able to provide existing local services to its customers without the right and ability to purchase unes and eels from the ilec at reasonable rates 
atx owns certain equipment and facilities which enable it to reduce the cost of the components it would otherwise have to purchase from an ilec 
atx currently owns and operates five carrier class switches in philadelphia  pennsylvania and herndon  virginia that provide a combination of local  long distance  and voice over internet protocol voip services  which connect calls to the public switched telephone network

wireless services 
atx offers wireless services primarily as a customer retention tool  consisting of both cellular and paging service 
coreconnect  local and long distance telephone services currently account for approximately of atx s revenues 
for the period from acquisition to december   atx s revenues were concentrated in certain states  principally pennsylvania   new jersey   maryland   virginia and washington dc   and delaware  
some of atx s telecommunication services are not connected to its network or switches 
for these services atx may simply be a reseller of the ilecs services  or a seller of une p services 
atx typically provides these services to customers in areas where atx does not maintain network facilities or where customers do not have sufficient line needs to qualify for coreconnect 
atx s margins for these services are typically lower than services provided on its network 
recent regulatory action has increased the rates that ilecs can charge for these services  which has forced atx to raise its prices  adversely impacting atx s ability to remain competitive for these products 
atx expects that its revenues for une p and reseller services will decline over time 
for the period from acquisition through december   these services accounted for approximately of atx s revenues 
sales and marketing atx s sales model is based on a consultative approach 
each sale begins with a consultation that evaluates the needs of the prospective customer 
atx then designs a tailored  integrated and cost effective solution that addresses the specific customer s communications needs

atx s customers are billed on a single  consolidated invoice  delivered by traditional means 
it does not depend upon any single customer for any significant portion of its revenue 
neither atx s business nor the telecommunications industry is generally characterized as having a material seasonal element and it does not expect the business or the industry to become seasonal in the future 
competition the telecommunications industry is highly competitive  and is impacted by regulatory changes  product substitution  technological advances  excess network capacity and the entrance of new competitors 
competition for products and services is based on price  quality  network reliability  service features and responsiveness to customers needs 
atx faces competition from regional bell operating companies such as verizon communications  inc and at t  inc  as well as other providers of wireline telecommunications services  wireless telephone companies and voip providers 
in the local telephone markets  atx s principal competitor is the ilec  which is usually verizon 
verizon is also atx s principal supplier of unes  une p and eels 
wireless telephone companies have been taking market share from providers of wireline voice communications 
cable television companies that offer high speed internet access are expanding their offerings to voice based telephone services 
many facilities based clecs have committed substantial resources to building their networks or to purchasing other industry participants with complementary facilities 
by building or purchasing a network or entering into interconnection agreements or resale agreements with ilecs or long distance carriers  a provider can offer a single source for local and long distance services similar to those offered by atx 
many of atx s competitors have substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  with greater flexibility and a lower cost structure than atx 
the completion of large mergers within the telecommunications industry during the past year could result in improved cost structures for atx s competitors  which could result in competitors offering lower prices 
government regulation atx is subject to significant federal  state and local laws  regulations and orders that affect the rates  terms and conditions of certain of its service offerings  its costs and other aspects of its operations 
regulation of the telecommunications industry varies from state to state  and changes in response to technological developments  competition  government policies and judicial proceedings 
the company cannot predict the impact  nor give any assurances about the materiality of any potential impact that such changes may have on its business or results of operations  nor can it guarantee that regulatory authorities will not raise material issues regarding its compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the fcc has jurisdiction over atx s facilities and services to the extent those facilities are used to provide interstate telecommunications services 
state regulatory commissions generally have jurisdiction over facilities and services to the extent the facilities are used in intrastate telecommunications services 
generally  the fcc and state commissions do not regulate internet  video conferencing or certain data services  although the underlying telecommunications services components of such offerings may be regulated in some instances 
the implementation of the telecom act  the emergence of new technologies and the financial distress of many in the telecommunications industry have involved numerous industry participants  including atx  in disputes  lawsuits  proceedings and arbitrations before state and federal regulatory commissions  private arbitration organizations  and federal and state courts 
these issues include the interpretation and enforcement of existing interconnection agreements  the terms of new interconnection agreements  inter carrier compensation  access rates applicable to different categories of traffic  the jurisdiction of traffic for inter carrier compensation purposes  the services and facilities available to atx  the price that atx will pay for those services and facilities and the regulatory treatment of new technologies and services 
atx anticipates that it will continue to be involved in various disputes  lawsuits  arbitrations and proceedings over these and other material issues  although no material litigation is currently pending 
atx anticipates that further legislative initiatives and regulatory rulemaking will occur 
rulings adverse to atx  adverse legislation  new regulations or changes in governmental policy on issues material to atx could have a material adverse effect on atx s financial condition or results of its operations 
as a clec  the availability of services and facilities purchased from ilecs and the rates ilecs can charge have a significant impact on atx s profitability 
the enactment of the telecom act enabled atx to purchase ilec services at favorable rates  however  certain subsequent regulatory action has resulted in more flexibility for ilecs in determining what products and services it provides and the rates it can charge 
in certain instances  regulatory action is shifting the determination of these rates from regulatory jurisdiction towards commercial negotiation between the parties  generally resulting in ilec price increases 
some of these developments are discussed below 
the fcc triennial review order on august   the fcc released its triennial review order tro addressing the remand on unes and its statutorily mandated comprehensive evaluation of unes  which was generally favorable to clecs 
in a portion of the tro  the fcc held that clecs such as atx could order new combinations of unes and eels  which in combination are the same elements that comprise higher priced special access facilities 
the tro also held that clecs could commingle unes and une combinations with other wholesale services  including special access services  and resold services 
on march   the court of appeals issued a decision reversing a substantial portion of the tro 
the court vacated the fcc s decision to order unbundling of mass market switches  special access facilities and dark fiber dedicated transport 
the court found reasonable the specific eel eligibility standards pursuant to which clecs may obtain high capacity eels 
however  given the availability of special access  the court expressed skepticism that carriers using special access circuits to provide competitive local exchange services were impaired without access to eels  and remanded this and other matters to the fcc for further consideration 
the fcc triennial review remand order on remand  in february  the fcc issued its triennial review remand order trro and adopted new rules  effective march  the fcc s trro and rules govern the obligations of ilecs to provide access to certain of their network elements  if at all  and the cost of such access 
the trro for the most part required that ilecs continue to provide competitors access to the high capacity loops and unes that atx uses 
however  as discussed below the new rules placed new conditions and limitations on the ilecs obligation to unbundle these elements 
moreover  the trro may have a material impact on atx s future business plans and operations  which can not be fully assessed until the new rates are determined 
high capacity loops and transport the trro reduced the ilecs obligation to provide high capacity loops within  and dedicated transport facilities between  certain ilec central offices that are deemed to be sufficiently competitive  based upon various factors such as the number of fiber based collocators and or the number of business access lines within such locations 
in addition  certain caps are imposed regarding the number of une facilities that a company  like atx  may have on a single route or into a single building 
where the central office conditions or the caps are exceeded  the trro eliminated the ilecs obligation to provide these high capacity circuits to competitors at the discounted rates historically received under the telecom act 
the rates charged by ilecs for atx s high capacity circuits in place on march  that were affected by the fcc s new rules were increased for one year until march  although the scope of this increase is uncertain because the new fcc rules are subject to interpretation by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  by march   atx will be required to transition those existing circuits to alternative arrangements  such as other competitive facilities or the higher priced special access services offered by the ilecs  unless another rate has been negotiated 
since march   any new circuits atx orders were subject to the ilecs higher special access pricing in ilec central offices that are deemed to be sufficiently competitive  or that exceed the caps  subject to any contractual protections under atx s existing interconnection agreements 
these rules will increase the cost of new circuits in central offices meeting these criteria from to  depending upon the size of the circuit ordered and its location 
entrance facilities on june   verizon  which is atx s principal ilec supplier  notified atx and other clecs of its intent  pursuant to the tro and trro  to eliminate its offering of entrance facilities at incremental cost based pricing  effective september  entrance facilities are used by atx to obtain access to unbundled elements it purchases from verizon 
in its notice verizon indicated that it would begin billing for entrance facilities at higher special access rates if atx has not re provisioned the une entrance facilities to alternative arrangements by september  ie  verizon special access term plans or alternative carriers 
on july   atx sent a letter to verizon indicating that it disagreed with verizon s position and that the issue was before public utility commissions as part of the trro mandated arbitrations to implement the fcc s new trro rules 
atx indicated that entrance facilities could not be eliminated under the trro until march   and took the position that verizon was not permitted to eliminate the entrance facilities prior to the conclusion of the arbitrations 
atx also argued that under the trro  it was entitled to continue to use entrance facilities to purchase unes until march   at existing une rates plus 
on august   verizon responded to atx s letter stating that it disagreed with atx s position 
in its letter  verizon stated that it intended to carry out its threat to discontinue entrance facilities effective september  and begin billing atx for entrance facilities at special access rates  although it provided a small exception for stand alone dedicated transport in delaware and maryland 
to date  verizon has not billed atx at special access rates but has indicated that it will back bill atx once its billing system is capable of billing the changes 
on september   the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc rejected verizon s attempts to implement a tariff eliminating entrance facilities 
the papuc suspended operation of verizon s tariff for six months or until at least march   unless it acts on the matter in the arbitrations prior to that time 
this ruling is of particular importance to atx because approximately of atx s entrance facilities are located in pennsylvania 
verizon has appealed the papuc decision in federal court 
atx and verizon have been attempting to negotiate a resolution of this dispute  but it is uncertain whether such a negotiated resolution will be possible 
atx believes it has adequately accrued for any unbilled amounts and has taken appropriate steps to eliminate its dependency on verizon s entrance facilities in the future 
unbundled local switching the trro determined that ilecs will no longer be required to provide access to unbundled circuit switching capabilities  which previously allowed clecs to serve their customers by purchasing une p at incremental cost based rates 
the trro permitted atx to continue purchasing existing une p arrangements for a period of one year after march   after which it has to either convert the customers to other arrangements or discontinue serving them 
atx began negotiations during with verizon to establish an alternative arrangement to provide service to its customers previously served via une p subsequent to march on december   atx entered into a wholesale contract with verizon for its principal local service territory  which will permit it to continue to provide service to its existing une p customer base  as well as provide service to new customers 
the terms of the contract will permit atx to serve its customers previously served utilizing une p with an arrangement nearly identical to une p  however  the contract required atx to begin paying increased charges per line to verizon for the service retroactively beginning september  at the end of the three year term of the contract rates will automatically go to higher resale rates unless a new contract is established  and there is no assurance that atx will be able to negotiate a new contract on acceptable terms 
interconnection agreements atx has agreements for the interconnection of its networks with the network of verizon and other ilecs and the purchasing of unes covering each market in which atx provides local services 
as the existing interconnection agreements expire  atx will be required to negotiate extension or replacement agreements 
atx s interconnection agreement with verizon is currently on a month to month basis  agreements with other ilecs are also for short term periods 
there are ongoing proceedings in most states to implement the tro and the trro that will likely result in amendments to atx s interconnection agreements with verizon and the other ilecs 
there can be no assurance that atx will successfully negotiate  arbitrate or otherwise replace or amend its interconnection agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to atx 
domestic real estate at december   the company s domestic real estate assets had a book value of  the real estate operations include a mixture of commercial properties  residential land development projects and other unimproved land  all in various stages of development and all available for sale

in order to develop its properties  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses  density  the installation of utility services such as water  sewer  gas  electric  telephone and cable television and the dedication of acreage for various community purposes 
furthermore  changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained 
delays in obtaining required approvals and authorizations could adversely affect the profitability of the company s projects 
other operations wineries the company owns two wineries  pine ridge winery in napa valley  california and archery summit in the willamette valley of oregon 
pine ridge  which was acquired in  has been conducting operations since  while the company started archery summit in since acquisition  the company s investment in winery operations has grown  principally to fund the acquisition of land for vineyard development and to increase production capacity and storage facilities at both of the wineries 
it can take up to five years for a new vineyard property to reach full production and  depending upon the varietal produced  up to three years after grape harvest before the wine can be sold 
the company controls acres of vineyards in napa valley  california and acres of vineyards in the willamette valley of oregon  substantially all of which are owned and producing grapes 
the company believes that its vineyards are located in some of the most highly regarded appellations of the napa and willamette valleys 
at december   the company s combined net investment in these wineries was  the wineries sold approximately  liter equivalent cases of wine generating wine revenues of  during  and  liter equivalent cases of wine generating wine revenues of  during these wineries primarily produce and sell wines in the luxury segment of the premium table wine market 
the company s wines are primarily sold to distributors  who then sell to retailers and restaurants 
the distributors used by the company also offer premium and luxury table wines of other producers that directly compete with the company s products 
as permitted under federal and local regulations  the wineries have also been placing increasing emphasis on sales direct to consumers  which they are able to do through the internet  wine clubs and at the wineries tasting rooms 
during  direct sales to consumers represented of case sales and of wine revenues 
sales of the company s wines in california excluding direct sales to consumers amounted to approximately of wine revenues 
the luxury segment of the wine industry is intensely competitive 
the company s wines compete with small and large producers in the us  as well as with imported wines 
demand for wine in the luxury market segment can rise and fall with general economic conditions  and is also significantly affected by available supply 
at present  there is a worldwide oversupply of luxury wine which may last for a few years 
the demand for the company s wines is also affected by the ratings given the company s wines in industry and consumer publications 
wines are rated on a to numerical scale for each vintage and each type of wine 
during the past year  ratings for some of the company s wines have increased or stayed the same while ratings for other company wines have declined relative to previous vintages 
future ratings are impossible to predict  however  the company expects ratings for newly released wines will continue to reflect the specific wine quality of the company s wineries and the overall perceived quality of the vintage in the napa and willamette valleys 
at the beginning of  inventory levels of the company s wines held by the company and its distributors were too high  resulting in the need to hold prices for certain varietals and increase spending on promotional  sales and marketing programs to sell more wine 
these efforts account for the increase in case sales in as compared to the prior year  and the wineries have significantly reduced the excess inventory levels 
in particular  pine ridge had been producing too much merlot for its historical sales volume  and it has reduced future production through re budding and re planting activities 
the company s wineries have also been focused on improving wine quality 
wine quality improvements are principally being made by reducing the amount of grape clusters grown on each grapevine resulting in yield reduction to further concentrate flavor  and investing in new winemaking equipment 
luxury wines available for sale in any given year are also dependent upon harvest yields of earlier periods  which can fluctuate from harvest to harvest depending on weather patterns  insects and other non controllable circumstances 
the wineries production  sales and distribution activities are subject to regulation by agencies of both federal and state governments 
many states have historically prohibited or restricted sales of wine direct to consumers by producers that are located in another state  even though the same states may permit in state producers to ship direct to in state consumers 
in a case that was decided by the us supreme court during  such discriminatory state direct shipment laws were held to violate the commerce clause of the us constitution 
as a result of the court s decision  some states have revised their laws to allow both in state and out of state wineries to ship directly to consumers 
other states have prohibited direct to consumer sales by in state and out of state wineries 
although the company is unable to predict the action that each state will take to comply with the court s decision  the company expects that this decision will increase its ability to market and sell wine direct to the consumer

risk factors 
our business is subject to a number of risks 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide whether to purchase our common stock 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible  and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares 
we continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of our existing operations and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses 
any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities 
consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition  results of operations and trading price at the present time 
future acquisitions and investments may expose us to risks to which we are not currently subject 
future acquisitions and investments may expose us to risks such as o the possibility that future acquisitions and investments may not immediately  if ever  add value to our company  o diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses  and o the possibility that the acquired businesses or investments will generate insufficient profits to offset the increased expenses associated with the acquisitions 
our ability to make future acquisitions and investments successfully depends on a range of factors  including our ability to identify and compete with others for potential acquisition targets  the acquisition price  terms and conditions of any completed acquisitions  and the future profitability of any new acquisitions and investments 
we are dependent on certain key personnel 
we are dependent on the services of ian m 
cumming and joseph s 
steinberg  our chairman of the board and president  respectively 
messrs 
cumming s and steinberg s employment agreements with us expire june  these individuals are also significant shareholders of our company 
as of february   messrs 
cumming and steinberg and their respective families excluding certain private charitable foundations beneficially owned approximately and of our outstanding common shares  respectively 
accordingly  messrs 
cumming and steinberg could exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  certain of which may be more susceptible to economic downturns than others 
the industries in which we operate may be subject to the effects of national or local economic cycles  increased competition and changes in demographic conditions  any of which may adversely affect our businesses and are beyond our control 
changes in economic conditions in the united states or internationally can cause fluctuation in prices and sales volumes which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
a worsening of general economic or market conditions may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets 
changes in the us housing market could reduce idaho timber s revenues and profitability 
idaho timber s revenues benefit from continued strong new housing starts and the strong home improvement market in the us any decline in the us housing market  which could result from local  regional  national or international economic changes  or from other factors  including increases in mortgage interest rate levels  would likely reduce demand for idaho timber s products and lower revenue 
changes in telecommunications laws and regulations could adversely affect atx 
atx operates in a highly competitive and regulated industry 
atx would not be able to provide many of its services to its customers without the ability to purchase services from its competitors  which is a right atx and others currently have pursuant to government laws promoting competition in local telephone markets 
recent changes in government regulations have either limited the ability of atx to purchase certain services  or increased the cost of those services to atx 
future regulatory changes could have an adverse impact on atx s ability to sell its products  to sell its products at a competitive price or to acquire the services it needs at a cost effective rate 
in addition  atx incurs substantial expenses complying with various local  state and federal regulations  and changes in these regulations could increase the cost of compliance 
we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in raw material prices and the availability of key raw materials 
we purchase significant amounts of raw materials from third parties for use in our plastics manufacturing and idaho timber businesses 
the price for polypropylene  the principal raw material used by the plastics manufacturing segment  tends to fluctuate with the price of oil and as a result has risen significantly over the past couple of years 
to the extent this trend continues and we are unable to pass these price increases to our customers  our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
a significant portion of idaho timber s raw material purchases are from foreign suppliers  and the availability of that supply can be adversely impacted by trade disputes 
in addition  raw material prices at idaho timber will not always rise and fall in proportion to selling prices of idaho timber s products  which can have a negative impact on operating results 
compliance with government laws and regulations require the expenditure of funds and adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development projects 
our real estate development business requires numerous governmental approvals  licenses and permits  which we must obtain before we can begin development and construction 
this approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals  by litigation and appeals challenging development rights and by changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws that may require additional approvals 
adverse regulatory changes or failure to obtain approvals could delay real estate development projects or make them more costly to complete 
changes in mortgage interest rate levels or changes in consumer lending practices could reduce consumer affordability and demand for some of our real estate development projects 
certain of our real estate development projects are dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for potential homebuyers 
any significant increase in the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment or decrease in available credit could reduce consumer demand for housing  which in turn could lead to fewer home sales or lower selling prices 
a decrease in consumer spending or general increases in the cost of living could adversely impact sales at our wineries 
our wineries primarily produce and sell wines in the luxury segment of the premium table wine market  and are significantly dependent on the level of consumer spending 
consumer spending habits are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including the general state of the economy  increases in the cost of living  federal and state income tax rates  deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state law and consumer confidence in future economic conditions

the services symphony provides are subject to periodic reviews  investigations and audits by governmental authorities to ensure that we are complying with standards established for continued licensure under state law  certification for participation under the medicare and medicaid programs and compliance with laws governing the transmission and privacy of patient healthcare information 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to meet these standards or if the standards change and we experience delays or incur additional costs in meeting the new standards 
our failure to obtain  retain or renew any required regulatory approvals  licenses or certificates could prevent us from being reimbursed for certain of our services 
symphony incurs substantial administrative costs complying with government laws and regulations 
symphony is also subject to potential lawsuits under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs due to continued intense competition for qualified staff in our healthcare business 
our inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel would make it difficult to conduct our healthcare business 
due to shortages in qualified professionals in the healthcare industry  competition for these employees is intense and symphony s competitors may offer more attractive wage and benefit packages than we do

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive

the company is in compliance with all of these restrictions  and the company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company also contain restrictions which require the maintenance of financial covenants  impose restrictions on the ability of such subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company and or provide collateral to the lender

as shown below  at december   the company s contractual cash obligations totaled  payments due by period in thousands less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years long term debt      estimated interest expense on long term debt      estimated payments related to derivative financial instruments     planned funding of pension and post retirement obligations    operating leases  net of sublease income      asset purchase obligations  operations and maintenance obligations total contractual cash obligations      the estimated interest expense on long term debt includes estimated interest related to variable rate debt which the company determined using rates in effect at december  estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at december  except for expected funding of  in  the company s consolidated pension liability is excluded from the table because the timing of cash payments is uncertain 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees referred to as the projected benefit obligation  and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in these plans have been frozen  future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest costs 
in recent years  the company s determination to make contributions to the pension trust accounts in excess of minimum required amounts was influenced by the tax deductibility of the contribution  a consideration that is no longer important because of the company s nols 
the company is currently analyzing the administrative and insurance costs associated with these plans and will make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts to reduce its plan liabilities 
the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain  however  the company believes it will make substantial additional contributions over the next few years to reduce  but not to entirely eliminate  its defined pension benefit plan liability 
the company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to  and wiltel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of wiltel 
as of december   certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below dollars in thousands the company s wiltel s plans plans projected benefit obligation   funded status balance sheet liability at december    deferred losses included in other comprehensive income   discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the company s plans  a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis  using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants 
for the wiltel plans  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market  adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements 
these discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by  and the benefit obligation by the deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates  changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  for all plans 
a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during  based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was   of which expires in   in and the remainder in subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
substantially all of these letters of credit expire before the company s remaining guarantee at december  is a  indemnification given to a lender to a certain real estate property 
the property was sold in early and the company was released from its indemnification obligation 
as discussed above  the company has also guaranteed certain amounts under clc s credit facilities  however  no amounts were borrowed by clc at december critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based  in significant part  upon the company s projection of future taxable income at any point in time 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
during  as a result of the consummation of certain transactions and ongoing operating profits  the company prepared updated projections of future taxable income 
the company s revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense 
the company s conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable was strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income 
the company s estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its current operations and investments  included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment  and included all future years that the company estimated it would have available nols 
over the projection period  the company assumed that its readily available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would provide returns generally equivalent to the returns expected to be provided by the company s existing operations and investments  except for certain amounts assumed to be invested on a short term basis to meet the company s liquidity needs 
the company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain  and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts  further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible 
conversely  if the company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future  or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced  additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded 
at december   the balance of the deferred valuation allowance was  the company is required to record the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance under gaap 
while the adjustment significantly increases the company s net worth  there is no current cash benefit to the company 
the adjustment will also result in the recording of material federal income tax expense in the future  even though no material cash expenditure for federal income taxes is expected 
further  while the adjustment results from the projection of taxable income over a long period of time  under gaap the expected future tax savings are not discounted 
as a result  this adjustment increases the company s net worth attributable to tax savings before the company has generated the taxable income necessary to realize those tax savings  when the tax savings are actually realized over time  net worth will be reduced by the recording of a deferred tax provision 
reflecting tax savings before the tax is actually saved results in the company s balance sheet being less conservative than the company would want it to be 
however  this accounting policy is mandated by gaap 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
as discussed above  wiltel s former headquarters building  including the adjacent parking garage  was not included in the sale to level and has been retained by the company 
the company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used  from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment  was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable 
on the closing date of the sale to level  the carrying amount of the facility was  based on the assumptions discussed below the company concluded that the carrying amount was not recoverable  and an impairment loss of  was recorded reducing the gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
at december   the new cost basis and carrying amount of the facility is  the facility is a fifteen story   square foot office building located in downtown tulsa  oklahoma for which construction was substantially completed in  with a total of approximately  rentable square feet 
approximately  square feet of the rentable space is leased to level under short term leases that expire at the end of  subject to level renewal options 
level also has the right to vacate approximately  square feet every six months commencing july  approximately  square feet are leased to another tenant also under a short term lease that is subject to renewal options 
the building is considered to be class a office space  and the company believes that the best value for the building would be obtained by selling the building to an owner occupant 
the facility is being marketed for sale at a gross selling price of  including furniture  fixtures and equipment 
the company utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of the facility 
in order to estimate the amount which could ultimately be realized upon the sale of the facility  the company had a market analysis prepared of sales and leasing activity for the downtown tulsa market 
the analysis identified the range of historical selling prices for properties of comparable quality  including the age  size and occupancy rates of the properties sold  properties currently available for sale or lease  current market occupancy rates and recent leasing rates 
since the facility is being marketed to an owner occupant  the cash flow estimates reflect that it may take from two to five years before a buyer is identified and the facility can be sold 
the cash flow estimates assume that level will only fulfill its minimum rental commitment  the company did not assume that space which is currently vacant will be leased  which results in negative operating cash flow prior to sale 
the company s cash flow estimates reflect a range of possible outcomes since the timing of the sale and the ultimate price that the company will realize for the facility is uncertain 
the company does not believe that there is any set of reasonable assumptions it could have made resulting in a conclusion that the facility was not impaired 
however  since the amount of the impairment recorded is greatly impacted by the estimated range of selling prices and the timing of the sale  the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate disposition of the facility is uncertain 
if the market for this type of property declines in the future or the company lowers its estimate of the future cash flows for other reasons  further reductions to the carrying amount of the facility could be required 
impairment of securities investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value 
the writedowns are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ materially from the company s estimates and judgments 
the company recorded impairment charges for securities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of independent appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss  however  under gaap the methods  assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long lived assets 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
purchase price allocations for all of the company s recent acquisitions have been finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material 
accruals for access costs atx s access costs primarily include variable charges paid to vendors to originate and or terminate switched voice traffic  which are based on actual usage at negotiated or regulated contract rates 
at the end of each reporting period  atx s estimated accrual for incurred but not yet billed costs is based on internal usage reports 
the accrual is subsequently reconciled to actual invoices as they are received  which is a process that can take several months to complete 
this process includes an invoice validation procedure that normally identifies errors and inaccuracies in rate and or volume components of the invoices resulting in numerous invoice disputes 
it is atx s policy to adjust the accrual for the probable amount it believes will ultimately be paid on disputed invoices  a determination which requires significant estimation and judgment 
due to the number of different negotiated and regulated rates  constantly changing traffic patterns  uncertainty in the ultimate resolution of disputes  the period of time required to complete the reconciliation and delays in invoicing by access vendors  these estimates may change 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations manufacturing idaho timber revenues and other income for idaho timber from the date of acquisition may through december  were  gross profit was  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were  depreciation and amortization expenses were  and pre tax income was  idaho timber s revenues reflect an oversupply in its dimension lumber and home center board markets  resulting partially from increased foreign imports and an easing of transportation bottlenecks that existed in the past 
the increased supply to the us market has resulted in lower selling prices  however  idaho timber s shipment volume of million board feet remained level with the comparable pre acquisition period in the prior year 
the steady demand was due in part to continued strong housing and home improvement markets during selling prices declined during  however  reductions in raw material costs  the largest component of cost of sales approximately of cost of sales  generally lagged behind the reduction in selling prices 
the difference between idaho timber s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet spread is closely monitored  and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same 
during  spread compressed from the very high level achieved in the prior year  negatively impacting gross profits and pre tax results 
with the current oversupply in the market  idaho timber intends to focus on developing new higher margin products  diversifying its supply chain  improving cost control and solidifying customer relationships  in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre tax results 
manufacturing plastics pre tax income for the plastics manufacturing segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

revenues increased by in  in and in  each as compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenues in reflects nsw s revenues since acquisition of  and increases in most of the segment s markets 
sales increases result from a variety of factors including the strong housing market  new products developed late in  and the impact of price increases implemented during the second half of and in the first and fourth quarters of raw material costs increased by approximately in as compared to the same period in  however  the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets  which along with increased sales and production volumes resulted in greater gross margins than in the primary raw material in the division s products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price tends to increase and decrease with the price of oil 
there is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the division s products 
in addition to managing resin purchases  the division also has initiatives to reduce and or reuse scrap thereby increasing raw material utilization 
gross margins also reflect  of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
pre tax results for include higher salaries  incentive compensation expense and sales commissions primarily related to nsw 
during  the division realized cost efficiencies resulting from its acquisition of nsw  principally in administration and overhead expense and raw material purchasing 
in the future  the division will look to make other strategic acquisitions of smaller entities that serve the same markets as nsw  primarily those that supply package netting and filtration products 
pre tax results for also reflect a charge of  resulting from the sale of certain assets related to a former product line of nsw 
manufacturing revenues in increased in substantially all of the division s markets 
the company believes that these increases result from a variety of factors including an improved economy  new product development and the acquisition in the first quarter of of customer receivables and inventory of a competitor that was exiting certain markets 
although raw material costs increased significantly in  this was more than offset by increased selling prices  sales and production volumes in most markets  resulting in increased gross profit and gross profit margins as compared to pre tax results for also reflect greater salaries expense  due to higher bonuses attributable to the division s improved performance  and include a gain of  resulting from the sale of certain assets related to a former product line

as described above  regulatory changes that went into effect on january  concerning medicare reimbursement for therapy services are likely to have some negative impact on symphony s future revenues and profitability  particularly in the medicare part a prospective payment system was changed to add new categories of services which effectively shifted the allocation of reimbursable services away from the services that symphony provides 
to the extent that symphony s customer contracts are linked to these categories of services  revenues and gross margins will decline unless symphony is successful in renegotiating its customer contracts to address this regulatory change 
although symphony has successfully renegotiated many of its contracts with respect to this matter  part a revenues for certain customers could decline 
with respect to medicare part b therapy services  most of these services became subject to an annual limitation per beneficiary of  for physical therapy and speech language pathology and  for occupational therapy services  subject to an exception process developed by cms for services deemed medically appropriate 
the cms exception process is retroactive to january   and is to be fully implemented no later than march  under the guidance cms published  the majority of symphony s patients will qualify for an automatic exception to the therapy cap limits 
those who do not qualify for the automatic exception are still eligible to obtain a manual exception  subject to cms approval 
while the exception process was under development  it created uncertainty among symphony s staff and customers which limited symphony s services to part b patients 
symphony is currently training operating and clinical staff on the new exception process  so that services can be provided when medically necessary  and expects that once training is complete revenues for medicare part b therapy services will increase 
however  symphony does not expect that revenues for part b medicare therapy services will increase to the level that they would have been absent implementation of the caps 
beginning in  symphony performed an evaluation of its customer base to identify those customers and markets where symphony could deliver the highest level of service and that should be the focus of customer retention efforts  as well as identifying those customers that should be terminated 
symphony is also seeking to grow its profitable businesses  which includes expanding its service offerings to existing customers 
the ability of symphony to grow its business depends heavily upon its ability to attract  develop and retain qualified therapists 
there is a current shortage of qualified therapists industry wide  and symphony has open positions to provide service to new customers  provide additional service offerings for existing customers and as a result of normal employee turnover 
the tight labor market causes symphony and others in its industry to  at times  hire independent contractors to perform required services  which may increase costs and reduce margins  and can also result in lost revenue opportunities if skilled independent contractors are not available at an acceptable cost 
the decrease in healthcare revenues in as compared to principally resulted from symphony s termination of certain underperforming customers  customer attrition and the sale of symphony s respiratory line of business in the second quarter of during the  and periods  one customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of symphony s revenues 
gross margins declined in as compared to  which reflects the revenue changes discussed above  higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain therapists and greater amounts incurred for independent contractors  both due to a shortage of licensed therapists in the marketplace  partially offset by improved therapist efficiency and reduced field management costs 
pre tax results for also reflect higher borrowing costs  greater professional fees for certain outsourced services and expenditures for hiring  training and automation  which symphony hopes will help offset the increase in the costs of therapists  and higher depreciation expense 
pre tax results also reflect aggregate gains of  from the sale of certain property and the respiratory line of business 
excluding charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense  profits for the fourth quarter of were approximately  despite a decline in revenues from the comparable period in the prior year and industry wide labor cost increases 
symphony is beginning to realize the benefits of its efforts to invest in automation to improve efficiency and reduce expenses  and to enhance its service offerings and terminate unprofitable contracts 
symphony s margins for reflect higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain its therapists  and increased costs to hire independent contractors as a result of hiring needs for both full time and part time professionals 
pre tax results for also reflect approximately  from the collection of receivables in excess of their carrying amounts  a decrease in estimated liabilities for employee health insurance costs and other third party claims of approximately  and a gain of  from the sale of certain property 
in addition  pre tax results for reflect approximately  of costs  principally severance for symphony s former chief executive officer and others due to reorganizing and consolidating certain field operations and closing offices

from acquisition through december   atx telecommunications revenues and other income were  telecommunications cost of sales were  salaries and incentive compensation expense was  depreciation and amortization expenses were  selling  general and other expenses were  and atx had a pre tax loss from continuing operations of  atx s cost of sales in reflects the migration of portions of its network to lower cost providers  the favorable resolution of an access cost dispute and a favorable rate change for unbundled local circuits  however  these cost reductions were offset by une p and entrance facility rate increases from verizon 
atx had a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of  in as discussed above  atx s ability to provide quality services at competitive prices to its customers is significantly dependent upon its ability to use or purchase various components of an ilec s network and infrastructure 
however  atx does own certain equipment and facilities that help mitigate its reliance upon ilecs and reduce its costs 
the enactment of the telecom act enabled atx to purchase ilec services at favorable rates  however  certain subsequent regulatory action has resulted in more flexibility for the ilec in determining what products and services it provides and the rates it can charge 
in certain instances  regulatory action is shifting the determination of these rates from regulatory jurisdiction towards commercial negotiation between the parties  generally resulting in ilec price increases 
for some stand alone product lines  in particular local telephone services  atx does not expect it will be able to offer a competitive product because its charges from the ilec have risen  resulting in a price increase for atx s customers 
atx has been and continues to restructure its operations to meet the changing competitive and regulatory environment and increased cost of services  however  atx s future profitability is uncertain 
domestic real estate pre tax income for the domestic real estate segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pre tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment s operating properties  the current status of the company s real estate development projects and non recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold 
as a result  the results of operations for this segment in the aggregate for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern 
in  the company sold its room waikiki beach hotel and related assets for an aggregate purchase price of  before closing costs and other required payments

finance revenues of  in and  in reflect this decreasing level of consumer instalment loans 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to  pre tax results increased due to gains from the loan portfolios sales  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  reductions in interest expense of  principally resulting from reduced customer banking deposits  less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
all of these changes reflected the ongoing reduction in the amount of loan assets under management  including as a result of the loan portfolios sales 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment include income of  for the year ended december   resulting from mark to market changes on interest rate swaps 
the company had used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits  all of the interest rate swap agreements matured in corporate and other operations investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to the  gain on the sale of of the company s interest in clc to inmet  greater investment income of  reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates  and increased sales at the wineries of  available corporate cash is generally invested on a short term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds

net securities gains for  and include provisions of   and  respectively  to write down the company s investments in certain available for sale securities and an investment in a non public security in the write down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary 
the company s decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security s value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future 
the decision could also be influenced by the status of the company s tax attributes or liquidity needs  however  sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations 
therefore  the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects interest expense relating to  principal amount of senior notes and  principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in april the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects the issuance of the bonds in  interest expense relating to  aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued during  and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities  which commencing july  are classified as interest expense shown as minority interest in prior periods

the valuation allowance was required because  on a pro forma combined basis  the company was not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that it would be able to realize the deferred tax asset 
subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel  during and any benefit realized from wiltel s deferred tax asset reduced the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset  however  that reduction was first applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets of wiltel rather than to reduce the income tax provision of any component of total comprehensive income 
as a result  the various components of comprehensive income include an aggregate federal income tax provision of  in and  in for the period subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel  even though no federal income tax for those periods was due 
during  the effect of recording this tax provision and the resulting reduction to the valuation allowance was to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets to zero
