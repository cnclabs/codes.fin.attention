item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor disclosure 
underwriting the company offers ceding companies full service capability  including actuarial  claims  accounting and systems support  either directly or through the broker community 
the company s capacity for both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers 
the company s strategy is to act as lead reinsurer in many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites 
the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger position to negotiate price  terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller position 
management believes this strategy enables it to more effectively influence the terms and conditions of the treaties on which it participates 
when the company does not lead the treaty  it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty 
the company may decline to participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors 
the company s treaty underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the company s underwriters  actuaries and claim staff 
treaties are reviewed for compliance with the company s general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses by the company 
the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties 
the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties 
the company does  however  generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty 
the company  when appropriate  also conducts underwriting  operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines 
underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff  the selection and pricing of risks and the capability of monitoring price levels over time 
claim audits  when appropriate  are performed in order to evaluate the client s claims handling abilities and practices 
the company s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks  limits and maximum risk exposures 
specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest re s new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients 
in addition  the company s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits  complexity or volatility  regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract 
non us risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations 
the company s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers 
these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager s capabilities 
the company s rates  forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types 
the company s underwriting  actuarial  claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate results monitoring mechanisms 
risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements underwriting risk and accumulation controls 
guidelines have been established for each segment and underlying business unit to manage its underwriting risk 
these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors  including ceding company profile  line of business  geographical location and risk hazards 
in each case  those guidelines permit limited exceptions  which must be authorized by the company s senior management 
these guidelines are regularly reviewed to attune them to business unit market conditions  including risk versus reward considerations  as well as the company s business portfolio management activities 
the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses stemming from its more volatile lines of business  particularly those that are catastrophe exposed 
the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by selective underwriting practices  diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business  limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone  purchasing retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured in a cost efficient manner 
see retrocession arrangements 
like other insurance and reinsurance companies  the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence  whether a natural event  such as a hurricane or an earthquake  or other catastrophe  such as an explosion at a major factory 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or more of the company s reinsurance treaties  facultative certificates  or across lines of business  including property and or casualty 
the company focuses on potential portfolio losses that can be generated by any single event as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events 
accordingly  the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas 
these techniques range from non modeled deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis 
to date  there is not one universal model capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographical regions that the company conducts business 
in addition  the form  quality  and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not always fully aligned with the data requirements for the company s licensed model s creating potential imprecision in the potential loss projections 
further  the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units 
such combination techniques are inherently difficult to apply and may affect the precision of the company s estimates 
also  most models have not been accurate in forecasting losses from the unprecedented series of hurricanes that impacted the insurance industry in and in particular  many models did not fully consider some of the perils and factors  which have been major contributors to the scale of events like the katrina loss  such as flood  storm surge  and potential demand surge 
finally  uncertainties with respect to future climate patterns and cycles introduce significant uncertainty with respect to the accuracy of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data 
nevertheless  when combined with traditional risk management and sound underwriting judgment  catastrophe models continue to be a useful tool for underwriters to price cat exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analysis with regard to monitoring and managing its catastrophe risk exposure by zone and risk hazard 
projected losses with respect to catastrophe events are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated loss  taking into account contract terms and limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake 
the expected pml will vary with the severity of modeled simulated losses and vary with the in force book of business 
the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods  such as year events and year events 
simply speaking  a year pml corresponds to a probability that losses from an event could exceed the indicated pml  alternatively  it corresponds to a probability that the loss distribution for an event falls below the indicated pml 
it is important to note that pmls are estimates derived quantitatively  with qualitative input as well  and that the events modeled are hypothetical events from a stochastic model 
as a result  there can be no assurance that any actual event s will align with the modeled event s or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml 
from a risk management perspective  the company continues to manage its catastrophe risk such that its largest individual year event  on an after tax basis  generally does not exceed approximately one half of projected net income 
management also monitors its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve  such as loss amounts at the      and  year return periods 
this monitoring procedure enables management to identify discrete risk zone and risk hazard exposure accumulations for integration into risk  underwriting and capital management processes 
the company s catastrophe loss projections  segmented by risk zones  are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process 
the table below reflects the company s pre tax pmls at various return times for its top three zones perils as ranked by the largest in year events based on loss projection data as of january  dollars in million return periods in years in in in in in in  exceeding probability zone area  peril se usa  wind california  earthquake europe  wind the above pml table is both gross and net of retrocessional coverage 
while the company considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the availability of cost effective protection  there was no retrocessional coverage in place at january  the company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various retrocessional products and approaches in the marketplace 
the impact of income taxes on the pml losses depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity  which is also affected by inter affiliate reinsurance 
using the in pml for a windstorm in the southeastern united states with a pre tax loss of million  the estimated after tax loss would be million 
the company believes that its methods of monitoring  analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework  which can be integrated with its underwriting business and capital management activities 
however  there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the models  risk management framework and underlying exposures 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections  including events impacting multiple zones  perhaps by a material amount 
nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience multiple severe events that could  in aggregate  exceed the company s pml expectations by a significant amount 
terrorism risk 
the company does not have significant exposure to losses from terrorism risk 
reinsurance contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorism  except where such coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the involved reinsurance 
while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorists events  the company s risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for properties or in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists 
although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable  most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage 
as a result  the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its us insurance book of business  particularly its workers compensation policies  however  the company generally does not insure the large corporations or corporate locations that would result in a large concentration of risk 
as a result of its limited exposure  the company does not believe the us terrorism risk insurance act of that was signed into law november and amended in december has had or will have a significant impact on its operations 
retrocession arrangements 
the company considers retrocessional agreements to reduce its exposure on specific business written and potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
where reinsurance is purchased  the agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses from retrocessionaires 
the level of retrocessional coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
all retrocessional purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
no assurance can be given that the company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in the past 
the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written  but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and or cost effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed 
the company also participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies  including the ceding company  with respect to the involved treaties 
the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the us insurance operation 
the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures  individual program exposures  aggregate exposures by line of business  overall segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance 
facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for individual accounts with large exposure and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for individual programs of business 
in evaluating the purchase of reinsurance for a line of business  the company generally seeks to limit exposure to individual claim severity as opposed to frequency 
the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective retrocessional protection 
for years ended december   and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to million of coverage for each year 
these excess of loss policies provided coverage if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified attachment point for each year of coverage 
the attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the company to offset  on a pre tax income basis  up to approximately of such ceded losses 
the maximum recovery for each year was million before giving effect to the adjustable premium 
as of december   the company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts 
the company has not purchased similar corporate level coverage subsequent to december  although certain of the company s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that losses are ceded  all aspects of the company s retrocessional program have been structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mt 
mckinley in september  the company had coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by prudential property and casualty insurance company of indiana prupac  a wholly owned subsidiary of the prudential 
on october   lm property casualty insurance company lm completed its purchase of prupac and its obligations from the prudential 
the prudential continues to guarantee lm s obligation under this agreement 
this agreement covers  or million  of the first million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of mt 
mckinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the company as such losses are paid by the company 
cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at december  as of december   the company carried as an asset  million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded 
of this amount  million  or  was receivable from subsidiaries of london reinsurance group london life  million  or  was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic  million  or  was receivable from lm and million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
although management carefully selects its reinsurers  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
the company s arrangements with both london life and continental are managed on a funds held basis  which means that the company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire  but rather retains such payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire  records them as a liability  credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due 
as of december   such funds had reduced the company s net exposure to london life to million  effectively of which has been secured by letters of credit  and its exposure to continental to million 
claims reinsurance claims are managed by the company s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues  monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies  establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims 
in addition to claims assessment  processing and payment  the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies 
insurance claims  except those relating to mt 
mckinley s business  are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the company s professional claims staff 
the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental a e exposures through dedicated  centrally managed claim staffs for mt 
mckinley and everest re 
both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures 
these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account  responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate 
specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management  actuarial  legal and financial areas 
meetings among these areas  claim management and senior management are held at least quarterly to review the company s overall reserve positions and make changes  if appropriate 
the company continually reviews its internal processing  communications and analytics  seeking to enhance the management of its a e exposures  in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and litigation 
reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves  which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses on losses that have already occurred 
actual losses and lae paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves 
to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage  the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings  which could be material in the period such recognition takes place 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and lae reserves 
as part of the reserving process  insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts  changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends 
while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future 
as a result  actual losses and lae may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years  which has led to adjustments in losses and lae reserves 
the increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in which the adjustments were made 
there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income 
changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for and subsequent years 
the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the company s loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars  the impact of which is not material 
the top line of the table shows the estimated initial reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date 
the upper paid portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves were carried as of each specific year end 
the lower liability re estimated portion shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the reserve estimates change as more information becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest liability re estimated amount 
each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  if a loss settled in for  was first reserved in at  and remained unchanged until settlement  the  deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency in each of the years in the period through shown below 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future developments 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table

some totals may not reconcile due to rounding 
five of the most recent six years on the above table reflect cumulative deficiencies  also referred to as adverse development  with the largest indicated deficiency in three active classes of business were the principal contributors to those deficiencies professional liability reinsurance  general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance 
in addition to these active business classes  there has continued to be adverse experience on a e reserves 
in the professional liability reinsurance class  the late s and early s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate  financial and or management improprieties 
this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional liability policies reinsured by the company 
in the general casualty area  the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the company s pricing and reserving assumptions  particularly for accident years and this experience reflects unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability 
with respect to both of these classes  another factor was the increasingly competitive conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period 
while the company seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results  it is generally unable to insulate itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its principal business 
see item  business competition 
in the workers compensation insurance class  the majority of which was written in california  the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years and due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity 
as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment  the company s writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than are some of its established and or stable lines of business 
although  cumulative results through continue to be quite profitable for this book of business  there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
while there can be no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves  reserving methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these statements regarding the company s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor disclosure 
the following table is derived from the ten year gaap loss development table above and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended december  each column represents the amount of net reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re estimates for the indicated accident years 
since the company has operations in many countries  part of the company s loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period 
fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies  period over period  affect the us dollar amount of outstanding reserves 
the translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re estimates

this adjustment converts canadian dollars to us dollars the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table 
the unfavorable development experienced in the through accident years relates principally to casualty reinsurance  including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where  in retrospect  the company s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures 
the favorable development for accident years through relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business 
the company s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends  seeking  on a timely basis  to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis 
the following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the years indicated on a gaap basis reconciliation of reserves for losses and lae years ended december  dollars in millions gross reserves at beginning of period    incurred related to current year    prior years total incurred losses    paid related to current year prior years   total paid losses    foreign exchange translation adjustment change in reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and lae gross reserves at end of period    prior year incurred losses were million favorable in and million and million unfavorable in and  respectively 
such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above  as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves 
reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses as of year end  of reserves reflect an estimate for the company s ultimate liability for a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
the company s a e liabilities stem from mt 
mckinley s direct insurance business and everest re s assumed reinsurance business 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asbestos and environmental exposures and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mt 
mckinley s book of direct a e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous 
it also arises from a limited period  effective to the book is based principally on excess liability policies  thereby limiting exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms 
as a result of this focused structure  the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures  allowing it to identify  analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure  including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non products asbestos claims 
the company aims to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt 
mckinley 
such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement  negotiation  litigation  or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place sip agreements 
sip agreements generally condition an insurer s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer s payments 
the company s mt 
mckinley operation is currently managing seven sip agreements  three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in the company s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments  because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty 
the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time  as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active 
those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous  but still active management  with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics  which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity 
the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders  including those that may not have reported significant a e losses 
everest re s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a e exposed relationships 
it also arises from a limited period  effectively to because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a e exposures for many years  its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities 
the company s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies 
this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company s analysis of its exposure through those companies 
as a result  the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as non products asbestos claims  for concentrated attention 
however  in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities  the company relies on claims data supplied  both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers 
this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the company s ultimate loss projections 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s total reserves for a e losses  gross and net of reinsurance  for the years ended december dollars in millions case reserves reported by ceding companies additional reserves established by the company assumed reinsurance case reserves established by the company direct insurance ibnr reserves gross reserves reinsurance receivable net reserves additional reserves are case specific reserves determined by the company to be needed over and above those reported by the ceding company 
additional losses  including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures  which are as yet unrecognized  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry  may emerge in the future 
such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future policy benefit reserves future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts

investments the board of directors of each of the company s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and  together with senior management  for overseeing their execution 
the policies and guidelines stress diversification of risk  capital preservation  market liquidity and stability of income 
beyond these fundamental objectives  the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income  through a high quality  diversified  taxable bond and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and tax position 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries are regulated 
generally  an independent investment advisor is utilized to manage the company s fixed income investment portfolio within the established guidelines and is required to report activities on a current basis and to meet with the company periodically to review and discuss the portfolio structure  securities selection and performance results 
the company directly manages its investments in its equity and other invested asset portfolios 
the company s fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security 
this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management  which considers economic and business factors  as well as the company s average duration of potential liabilities  which  at december   is estimated at approximately years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations 
the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december  was years  down from years for the prior year 
this shortened duration mainly reflects the company s elevated short term investment holdings following the million of net proceeds raised in connection with the secondary common shares offerings in the fourth quarter 
in addition  at various times during the past three years the company shortened duration in response to market interest rate movements by purchasing interest only strips of mortgage backed securities interest only strips 
the interest only strips give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages 
the interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated aaa 
the ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the underlying mortgage pool 
generally  as market interest rates and  more specifically  market mortgage rates decline  mortgagors tend to refinance  which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows 
conversely  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates rise  repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise 
accordingly  the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall 
these movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the company s other fixed income investments 
for each currency in which the company has established substantial reserves  the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated liabilities 
approximately of the company s consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies 
the company s overall financial strength and results of operations are  in part  dependent on the quality and performance of its investment portfolio 
net investment income and net realized capital gains losses on the company s invested assets constituted   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   which consisted of fixed maturities and cash of which were investment grade  equity securities and other invested assets 
the average maturity of fixed maturities was years at december   and their overall duration was years 
as of december   the company did not have any investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments  other than equity index puts discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the company s management believes could threaten the issuer s ability to meet debt service payments  except where other than temporary impairments have been recognized 
as of december   the company s common stock portfolio  which is comprised primarily of publicly traded equity index funds  had a market value of  million  comprising of total investments and cash

financial strength ratings the following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the company s operating subsidiaries as reported by am best  standard poor s rating services standard poor s and moody s investors service  inc moody s 
these ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company 
all of the below mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised  if necessary  by each of the rating agencies 
the company believes that its ratings  in general  have become increasingly important to its operations because they provide the company s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the company s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons 
strong financial strength is particularly important for reinsurance companies 
ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future 
as a result  a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred 
operating subsidiary am best standard poor s moody s everest re a superior aa very strong aa excellent bermuda re a superior aa very strong aa excellent everest international a superior not rated not rated everest national a superior aa very strong not rated everest indemnity a superior not rated not rated everest security a superior not rated not rated mt 
mckinley not rated not rated not rated am best states that the a superior rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders based on am best s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile 
the company s a superior rating is the second highest of fifteen ratings assigned by am best  which range from a superior to f in liquidation 
standard poor s states that the aa rating is assigned to those insurance companies which  in its opinion  have very strong financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms 
the company s aa rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned by standard poor s  which range from aaa to r 
ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the use of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing of the insurer within those rating categories 
moody s states that insurance companies rated aa offer excellent financial security 
together with the aaa rated companies  aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high grade companies  with aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long term risks 
moody s rating gradations are shown through the use of nine distinct symbols  each symbol representing a group of ratings in which the financial security is broadly the same 
the company s aa excellent rating is the fourth highest of ratings assigned by moody s  which range from aaa exceptional to c lowest 
moody s appends numerical modifiers  and to each generic rating classification from aa through caa 
subsidiaries other than everest re and bermuda re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary s operations 
in particular  mt 
mckinley is not rated because it is in run off status 
debt ratings the following table shows the debt ratings by am best  standard poor s and moody s of the holdings senior notes due march  and october  and everest re capital trust capital trust and everest re capital trust ii s capital trust ii trust preferred securities due november  and march   respectively  all of which are considered investment grade 
debt ratings are a current assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation 
am best standard poor s moody s senior notes a strong ability a strong security a good security trust preferred securities a strong ability bbb good security baal adequate security a debt rating of a or a is assigned by am best where the issuer  in am best s opinion  has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation 
the a and a ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of ratings assigned by am best  which range from aaa to ccc 
a debt rating of a is assigned by standard poor s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories 
standard poor s assigns a debt rating of bbb to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the a and bbb ratings from standard poor s are the seventh and ninth highest of ratings assigned by standard poor s  which range from aaa to d 
according to moody s  a debt rating of a is assigned to issues that are considered upper medium grade obligations and subject to low credit risk 
obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics 
the a and baa ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of ratings assigned by moody s  which range from aaa to c 
competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  yet cyclical by product and market 
competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the company underwrites is based on many factors  including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer  ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best and or standard poor s s p  underwriting expertise  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered  premiums charged  other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered  services offered  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees  as applicable to the specific participant s circumstances 
they also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally  contributing  in combination with background economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies by participant and in the aggregate  to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates  terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results 
the company competes in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors 
the company s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
in and  market conditions weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from through pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly 
competition increased modestly as well  in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers from through  the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing pressures to effectively redeploy this capital 
however  this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by market participant  reflecting the fact that the industry was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second halves of both and  generally weak investment market conditions and ongoing adverse loss development 
all of these factors depressed the industry s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of individual insurer s financial strength during the period 
for the insurance industry  was a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity  which negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of re insurance market participants 
the company believes that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped to stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to generally improving market conditions during that are likely to vary by product and market 
for the property catastrophe and retrocession lines  the company expects that demand and pricing will increase the most as companies reassess their risk management approach and rating agencies raise the required capital levels for many industry participants 
the company believes that price increases for these two lines will be most pronounced in peak catastrophe zones  such as the southeastern us for remaining property lines  there will likely be modest rate increases  while the casualty markets have generally steadied and are expected to stabilize at adequate pricing levels in for both insurance and reinsurance 
the company notes that it continues to see opportunities for profitable writings in a variety of classes and lines owing mainly to the general adequacy of underlying pricing 
however  the company continues to examine its view of price adequacy for property lines in light of s unprecedented catastrophe experience from both a frequency and severity perspective 
this reexamination is focused on several key factors including the magnitude and character of catastrophe exposures  the level of required capital to support the company s businesses from both the company s and rating agencies perspectives and the actual and potential volatility and variability of results  by product  business class and business unit  including with respect to the reliability of underlying statistical and modeling techniques 
employees as of march   the company employed persons 
management believes that its employee relations are good 
none of the company s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements  and the company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements 
regulatory matters the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business  including essentially all states of the us  canada  singapore  the united kingdom and bermuda 
these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the company s conduct of business  financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations relating to its business transactions and operations 
many of these regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the company s performance 
insurance holding company regulation 
under applicable us laws and regulations  no person  corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the company  unless such person  corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of delaware and the other states in which the company s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled  currently california and georgia 
under these laws  control is presumed when any person acquires  directly or indirectly  or more of the voting securities of an insurance company 
to obtain the approval of any change in control  the proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing  among other things  the background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers  the acquirer s financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company 
us state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter affiliate transactions within the holding company structure 
see dividends 
the insurance companies act of canada also requires prior approval by the minister of finance of anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in canada 
in addition  the company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business 
certain of these states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above 
dividends 
under bermuda law  group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium additional paid in capital accounts 
group s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under bermuda law as well as the laws of the various us states in which group s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled 
the limitations are generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders surplus or minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices 
as holdings has outstanding debt obligations  it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and to pay dividends to group 
under bermuda law  bermuda re is unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
as a long term insurer  bermuda re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless  after payment of the dividend  the value of the assets in its long term business fund  as certified by its approved actuary  exceeds its liabilities for long term business by at least the  minimum solvency margin 
prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority is required if bermuda re s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory capital by or more 
at december   bermuda re and everest international met their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin 
the payment of dividends to holdings by everest re is subject to limitations imposed by delaware law 
generally  everest re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus  which was  million at december   and only after it has given days prior notice to the delaware insurance commissioner 
during this day period  the commissioner may  by order  limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress 
further  the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the delaware insurance commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of of an insurer s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or the insurer s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year 
under this definition  the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by everest re in without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is million 
insurance regulation 
neither bermuda re nor everest international is admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the us both conduct their insurance business from their offices in bermuda  and in the case of bermuda re  its branch in the uk 
in bermuda  bermuda re and everest international are regulated by the insurance act as amended and related regulations the act 
the act establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects bermuda re and everest international to the supervision  investigation and intervention powers of the bermuda monetary authority 
under the act  bermuda re and everest international  as class insurers  are each required to maintain a principal office in bermuda  to maintain a minimum of million in statutory capital and surplus  to have an independent auditor approved by the bermuda monetary authority conduct an annual audit and report on their respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss reserve specialist also approved by the bermuda monetary authority review and report on their respective loss reserves annually 
bermuda re is also registered under the act as a long term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity business 
as a long term insurer  bermuda re is required to maintain  in statutory capital separate from its class minimum statutory capital and surplus  to maintain a long term business fund  to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually 
us domestic property and casualty insurers  including reinsurers  are subject to regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed 
the regulation of reinsurers is typically related to the reinsurer s financial condition  investments  management and operation 
the rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to direct regulation by any governmental authority 
the operations of everest re s foreign branch offices in canada  and singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those jurisdictions 
management believes that the company is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and operations 
effective january   everest re sold its united kingdom branch to bermuda re  a bermuda insurance company and direct subsidiary of group 
business for this branch was previously included in the international segment and is now included in the bermuda segment 
as a result of this transaction  bermuda re s operations in the united kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the financial services authority the fsa 
the fsa imposes solvency  capital adequacy  audit  financial reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the united kingdom 
bermuda re presently meets or exceeds all of the fsa s solvency and capital requirements 
everest indemnity  everest national  everest security and mt 
mckinley are subject to regulations similar to the us regulations applicable to everest re 
in addition  everest national and everest security must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct business 
these additional requirements include  but are not limited to  rate and policy form requirements  requirements with regard to licensing  agent appointments  participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures 
these regulations are primarily designed for the protection of policyholders 
licenses 
everest re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and or reinsurer in all states except nevada and wyoming  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
in new hampshire and puerto rico  everest re is licensed for reinsurance only 
such licensing enables us domestic ceding company clients to take credit for reinsurance ceded to everest re 
everest re is licensed as a property and casualty reinsurer in canada 
it is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in singapore 
everest re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries 
because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market for local insurers  everest re is registered as a foreign insurer and or reinsurer in the following countries argentina  bolivia  chile  colombia  ecuador  el salvador  guatemala  honduras  mexico  peru  venezuela and the philippines 
everest national is licensed in states and the district of columbia 
everest indemnity is licensed in delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
everest security is licensed in georgia and alabama 
mt 
mckinley is licensed in delaware and california 
bermuda re and everest international are registered as class insurers in bermuda 
bermuda re is also registered as a long term insurer in bermuda and an authorized reinsurer in the uk periodic examinations 
everest re  everest national  everest indemnity  everest security and mt 
mckinley are subject to periodic financial examination usually every years of their affairs by the insurance departments of the states in which they are licensed  authorized or accredited 
everest re s  everest security s  everest indemnity s and mt 
mckinley s last examination reports were as of december   while everest national s last examination was as of december  none of these reports contained any material findings or recommendations 
in addition  us insurance companies are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations 
naic risk based capital requirements 
the us national association of insurance commissioners naic employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
the major categories of a company s risk profile are its asset risk  credit risk  and underwriting risk 
the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies  to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments 
under the approved formula  a company s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no action is necessary 
below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases 
the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions 
the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated 
based on their financial positions at december   everest re  everest national  everest indemnity and everest security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds 
since mt 
mckinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in  its domiciliary regulator  delaware  has exempted mt 
mckinley from complying with rbc requirements 
various proposals to change the rbc formula arise from time to time 
the company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted  the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect  if any  the adoption of any such proposal or change in the rbc calculations would have on the company 
tax matters 
the following summary of the taxation of the company is based on current law 
there can be no assurance that legislative  judicial  or administrative changes will not be enacted that materially affects this summary 
bermuda 
under current bermuda law  no income  withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon group and its bermuda subsidiaries 
group and its bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda that  in the event of any taxes being imposed  group and its bermuda subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in bermuda until march non bermuda branches of bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
barbados 
through december   group maintained its principal office in barbados and was registered as an external company under the companies act  cap 
of barbados and was licensed as an international business company under the barbados international business companies act  as a result  group was subject to a preferred rate of corporation tax on profits and gains in barbados and was exempt from withholding tax on dividends  interest  royalties  management fees  fees or other income paid or deemed paid to a person who is not resident in barbados or who  if so resident  carried on an international business 
no tax was imposed on capital gains 
effective january   group s principal office was relocated to bermuda 
united states 
group s us subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the us us branches of us subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
should the us subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise to group  the company would be subject to withholding taxes 
group and its bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the us on this basis  group does not expect that it and its bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay us corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes 
if group or its bermuda subsidiaries were subject to us income tax  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
united kingdom 
bermuda re s uk branch conducts business in the uk and is subject to taxation in the uk 
bermuda re s bermuda operations believe that they have operated and will continue to operate in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to uk taxation 
if bermuda re s bermuda operations were subject to uk income tax there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to the other information provided in this report  should be considered when evaluating us 
if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly 
risks relating to our business our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events 
like all property and catastrophe insurance and reinsurance companies  we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events  including weather related and other natural catastrophes  as well as acts of terrorism 
any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations 
we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least million  before corporate level reinsurance and taxes 
effective for the third quarter  industrial risk losses have been excluded from catastrophe losses  with prior periods adjusted for comparison purposes 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  pre tax catastrophe losses  net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs  were as follows calendar year pre tax catastrophe losses  million million million million million our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections 
as with most industry participants  we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool 
based upon these loss projections  we may choose to decline additional business in certain geographical areas  purchase retrocessional coverage or take other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographical area from catastrophic events 
these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount 
we focus on potential losses that can be generated by any single event as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposure to catastrophic events 
accordingly  we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographical areas 
these techniques range from non modeled deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis 
as a result of the significant hurricane losses over the past two years  vendors for the statistical models are in the process of recalibrating their models  which may have a material impact on potential loss projections for us and the insurance industry 
if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses  net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss 
we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us 
in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities  we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and employing actuarial and statistical projections 
this information is not always timely or accurate and can result in inaccurate loss projections 
because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and lae  we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves 
if our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and lae  we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  the reserve re estimation process resulted in a decrease to our pre tax net income in four of the years calendar year effect on pre tax net income million increase million decrease million decrease million decrease million decrease see item  business changes in historical reserves  which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years 
during  there were three large hurricane events  katrina  rita and wilma  as well as other catastrophe losses  which resulted in significant incurred losses to our company 
the unprecedented magnitude and nature of these losses  the continuing lack of precise information from ceding companies regarding exposures  the complexities surrounding claim adjusting and settlement activities and the potential related regulatory and legal issues  as well as inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials  all contribute to uncertainty in the loss estimating process 
our current estimate for these losses is based on modeled information  underwriter analysis and judgments  client input and discussion  event modeling and profiling of exposed limits 
we expect it will be several quarters before relative clarity emerges with respect to ceding companies underlying losses 
as a result  losses may ultimately be materially greater than our initial estimated losses 
any future adjustments to estimated pre tax catastrophe losses will have an impact on incurred losses in the quarters during which such adjustments are made  and such impacts could be material 
the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential a e liabilities 
at year end  roughly of our gross reserves were comprised of explicit a e reserves 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability  which can be difficult to predict  also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for a e liabilities 
the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or generate a net loss 
our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain  we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae 
this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss 
in addition  losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced 
an example of an unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on september  neither the magnitude of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when we priced our coverages 
in addition to unanticipated events  we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures  particularly in long tail liability lines 
an example of this is the ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena  particularly for a e exposures discussed above 
decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income 
the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  yet cyclical by product and market 
these cycles  as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products  are outside of our control 
the supply of re insurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry 
demand for re insurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds  including catastrophe losses  and prevailing general economic conditions 
if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for re insurance or an overall increase in re insurance capacity  our net income could decrease 
in and  market conditions weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from through pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly 
competition increased modestly as well  in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers from through  the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing pressures to effectively redeploy this capital 
however  this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by market participant  reflecting the fact that the industry was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second half of  generally weak investment market conditions  and ongoing adverse loss development 
all of these factors depressed the industry s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of individual insurer s financial strength during this period 
for the insurance industry  was a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity which negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of re insurance market participants 
we believe that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped to stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to generally improving market conditions during albeit variable by product and market 
for the property catastrophe and retrocession lines  we expect that demand and pricing will likely increase the most as companies reassess their risk management approach and rating agencies raise the required capital levels for many industry participants 
we believe that price increases for these two lines will be most pronounced in peak catastrophe zones  such as the southeastern us for remaining property lines there will likely be modest rate increases  while the casualty markets have generally steadied and are expected to stabilize at adequate pricing levels in for both insurance and reinsurance 
however  beyond  it is possible that market conditions could weaken again 
in that regard  the capital strength of industry participants  as supplemented by new capital raised  by both existing industry participants and new opportunistic market entrants  could be perceived as sufficient to support the industry s aggregate exposures without requiring significant price increases or any fundamental changes in the pricing of industry products 
this development could have a material and adverse effect on our future prospects for growth and profitability 
further discussion of competitive issues can be found in item  business competition 
if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected 
our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by third party rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers 
our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best 
everest re  bermuda re and everest national hold an aa very strong rating from standard poor s 
everest re and bermuda re hold an aa excellent rating from moody s 
financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability 
during the last five years  no active subsidiary of ours has experienced a financial strength rating downgrade 
however  we cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future if we do not continue to meet the evolving criteria expected of our current rating 
in that regard  several of the rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating catastrophic risk relative to their capital and risk management requirements 
therefore  we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our ratings 
consistent with market practice  much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold 
the termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating fell below am best s a rating level  which is three levels below everest re s current rating of a 
to a lesser extent  everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade 
that provision would also generally be triggered only if everest re s rating fell below am best s a rating level 
the failure of our insureds  intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations could reduce our net income 
in accordance with industry practice  we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds  agents and brokers and or rely on agents and brokers to process our payments 
we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds  agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income 
we are also subject to the credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss 
if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers  our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience 
we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors  in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business 
we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance 
thus  we generally evaluate  underwrite  select and price our products prior to consideration of reinsurance 
however  our underwriters generally consider purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific insurance contracts or programs  and our senior management generally considers purchasing reinsurance with respect to potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of our operations  where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is expected to have a positive cost benefit relationship 
because we generally purchase reinsurance only when we expect a net benefit  the percentage of business that we reinsure  as indicated below  varies considerably from year to year  depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period 
percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  have thus reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our reinsurance operations 
because we have reduced our level of reinsurance purchases in recent years  our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall experience 
our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be particularly pronounced 
we compete globally in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors 
our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
according to standard poor s  we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where of the market share is concentrated 
the top twenty groups in our industry represent of the market s revenues 
the leaders in this market are munich re  swiss re including employers re  berkshire hathaway  hannover re  and syndicates at lloyd s 
relative to us  some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future should there be a significant change to the competitive landscape of our market 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
our success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
generally  we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations chairman and chief executive officer  joseph v 
taranto age  president and chief operating officer  thomas j 
gallagher age  and executive vice president and chief financial officer  stephen l 
limauro age 
of those three officers  we only have an employment contract with mr 
taranto 
that contract has been previously filed with the sec and was most recently amended on august  to extend mr 
taranto s term of employment from march  until march  we are not aware that any of the above three officers are planning to leave group or retire in the near future 
we do not maintain any key employee insurance on any of our employees 
special considerations apply to our bermuda operations 
under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after a proper public advertisement  no bermudian  spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda 
currently  all seven of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between march and december this includes mark de saram  the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation 
in the event his work permit were not renewed  we could lose his services  thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in bermuda until we were able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit 
our investment values and investment income could decline as they are exposed to interest rate  credit  and market risks 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments 
both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
for example  the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair market value of its fixed income securities can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase 
in addition  if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations  investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise 
because all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  temporary changes in the market value of these investments as well as equities are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in our portfolio could reduce our capital or cause us to incur a loss 
we have invested a growing portion of our investment portfolio in common stock or equity related securities 
the value of these assets fluctuate with equity markets 
in times of economic weakness  the market value and liquidity of these assets may decline  and may negatively impact net income and capital 
we also invest in non traditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities 
these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships 
the changes in value and investment income loss for these partnerships are more volatile than over the counter securities 
the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities  equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk 
dollars in thousands type of security as of december  of total fixed income mortgage backed securities  other asset backed  total asset backed  other fixed income  total fixed income  equity securities  other invested assets  cash and short term investments  total investments and cash  further discussion of market sensitive instruments can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market sensitive instruments 
we may experience foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels 
through our bermuda and international operations  we conduct business in a variety of foreign non us currencies  principally the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  and the singapore dollar 
assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
our functional currency is the us dollar  and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position 
in  we wrote approximately of our reinsurance coverages in non us currencies  as of december   we maintained approximately of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in non us currencies 
during    the impact on our quarterly pre tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of million to a gain of million 
further discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market sensitive instruments 
risks relating to regulation insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us  state and foreign insurance laws 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold  prescribe solvency  accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves 
these laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions 
such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds 
these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies 
the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends  interest and other payments on securities  as applicable  and could restrict the ability to expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to date  no material fine  penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation 
current legal and regulatory activities related to the insurance industry  including investigations into contingent commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non traditional products could affect our business and the industry 
the insurance industry has experienced uncertainty and negative publicity as a result of current litigation  investigations  and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental  and enforcement authorities  including the sec  with regard to certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents  the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes  and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional  loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products 
at this time  it appears the effects of these investigations will have more of an impact on specific companies being investigated rather than the industry as a whole  with greater transparency and financial reporting disclosures being required for the entire industry in these areas  however  the future impact  if any  on our operation  net income or financial condition can not be determined at this time 
risks relating to group s securities because of our holding company structure  our ability to pay dividends  interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends  loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries 
group and holdings are holding companies  each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating subsidiaries 
as a result  each of group s and holdings ability to pay dividends  interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it 
this ability is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us  state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions  including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
accordingly  the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to us and holdings in the future  which could prevent us from paying dividends  interest or other payments on our securities 
provisions in group s bye laws could have an anti takeover effect  which could diminish the value of its common shares 
group s bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
for example  group s bye laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti takeover effect election of directors is staggered  meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected each year  shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than of the common shares will be reduced to of the total voting power of the common shares  the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in i any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  ii any person holding controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  or iii any adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to group  any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders  group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder s common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if i any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  ii any person holds controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  or iii share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to group  any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder 
the board of directors has indicated that it will apply these bye law provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies 
for this purpose  passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible  pursuant to rule d b under the us securities exchange act of  to file a short form statement on schedule g  but excluding any insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company 
applicable insurance laws may also have an anti takeover effect 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company  a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity and competence of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for changes to the insurance company s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us  the insurance change of control laws of delaware  california and georgia would apply to such a transaction 
this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control 
investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation 
the companies act of bermuda the companies act  differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act  as modified in some instances by provisions of group s bye laws  and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders 
alternate directors 
group s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that each director may appoint an alternate director  who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director 
delaware law does not provide for alternate directors 
committees of the board of directors 
group s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints  and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non directors 
delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees  but those committees may consist only of directors 
interested directors 
bermuda law and group s bye laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity  either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors  then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction 
in addition  after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above  he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest  unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting 
under delaware law  an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit 
additionally  under delaware law  a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled the material facts as to the interested director s relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares  or the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized  approved or ratified 
transactions with significant shareholders 
as a bermuda company  group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders  including asset sales  in which a significant shareholder receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders with prior approval from group s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders 
in the case of an amalgamation  in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company  a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors  except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly owned subsidiaries 
if group was a delaware corporation  any business combination with an interested shareholder which  for this purpose  would include mergers and asset sales of greater than of group s assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least of group s outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder  unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute 
for purposes of the delaware statute  an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that person s affiliates and associates owns  or within the previous three years did own  or more of a corporation s outstanding voting shares 
takeovers 
under bermuda law  if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and  within four months of the offer  the holders of not less than of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares  the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer 
the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer 
the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders 
under another provision of bermuda law  the holders of of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares 
within one month of the court s appraisal  the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders 
if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the court s appraisal price  the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder  who must then refund the purchase price 
there are no comparable provisions under delaware law 
inspection of corporate records 
members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of group available at the office of the registrar of companies and group s registered office  both in bermuda 
these documents include the memorandum of association  which describes group s permitted purposes and powers  any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in group s authorized share capital 
shareholders of group have the additional right to inspect group s bye laws  minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders 
the register of shareholders of group also is open to inspection by shareholders without charge  and to members of the public for a fee 
group is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in bermuda 
group also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us  which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act 
group is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge 
however  bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records 
under delaware law  any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation s shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person s interest as a shareholder 
shareholder s suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of group s memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of group s shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
under delaware law  class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in these types of actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees 
limitation of liability of directors and officers 
group s bye laws provide that group and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that director s or officer s duties 
however  this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty 
this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws 
under delaware law  a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty 
however  these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty  acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  the authorization of unlawful dividends  stock repurchases or stock redemptions  or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit 
moreover  these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws 
indemnification of directors and officers 
group s bye laws provide that group shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done  concurred in or omitted in the conduct of group s business or in the discharge of their duties 
under bermuda law  this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company  as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action  suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense  the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
enforcement of civil liabilities 
group is organized under the laws of bermuda 
some of our directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us a person may not be able to effect service of process within the us on directors and officers of group and those experts who reside outside the us a person also may not be able to recover against them or group on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or group in bermuda courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
dividends 
bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a company  after the payment is made  would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or that the realizable value of a company s assets would be less  as a result of the payment  than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of a company s issued shares  and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value 
under delaware law  subject to any restrictions contained in a company s certificate of incorporation  a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or  if there is no surplus  out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital 
delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
risks relating to taxation if us tax law changes  our net income may be reduced 
in the last few years  some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to low tax jurisdictions 
also  some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions  including bermuda 
although the existing legislation that increases the us tax burden on so called inverting companies does not apply to us  we do not know whether any similar legislation disadvantageous to our bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be enacted into law 
if it was enacted  the us tax burden on our bermuda operations  or on some business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers  could be increased 
this could reduce our net income 
group and or bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax  which would reduce our net income 
bermuda re 
the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations 
we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines  we believe that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the internal revenue service irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business in the us  bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business  we believe that the us bermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda re s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary 
we do not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us  bermuda re would be subject to us tax on that income 
group 
we conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our us tax exposure 
based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts  if any  of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  we believe that we should be required to pay only immaterial amounts  if any  of us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that we had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  we would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
prior to january   our principal executive offices were located in barbados and  as a result  even if the irs had successfully contended that we had material amounts of income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  we believe that the us barbados tax treaty would have precluded the irs from taxing our income  except to the extent that our income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by us in the us since we moved our principal executive offices out of barbados as of december  and since the united states and barbados recently made effective a protocol to the us barbados tax treaty that strengthens the limitation of benefits provisions of that treaty  the us barbados tax treaty will no longer provide any protection to us 
nevertheless  we doe not believe that we have material amounts of income subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us if the irs successfully contended  however  that we did have income subject to tax in the us  the imposition of tax on that income would reduce our net income 
if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax  our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax 
in that event  group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations 
the combined effect of the us corporate income tax rate and the branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 
the imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income 
group and or bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax  which would reduce our net income 
group and bermuda re currently are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in bermuda 
both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares  debentures or other obligations until march  this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to group or bermuda re 
there are currently no procedures for extending these assurances 
as a result  group and bermuda re could be subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which could reduce our net income 
our net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased 
bermuda re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the us in addition  bermuda re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources 
these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda re s business  which could reduce our net income
