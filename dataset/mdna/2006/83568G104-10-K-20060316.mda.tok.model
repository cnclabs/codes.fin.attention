item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world leader in hand carried ultrasound hcu 
we specialize in the development of hcu systems for use in a variety of medical specialties and in a range of clinical settings 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design hand carried diagnostic ultrasound systems that combine high resolution  all digital  broadband imaging with advanced features and capabilities typically found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the performance  size  durability  ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing ultrasound markets  and are opening new markets by bringing ultrasound out of the imaging lab to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table 
the large size  weight and complexity of traditional cart based ultrasound systems typically require a physician or highly trained clinician to perform the examination in a centralized imaging department  such as a hospital s radiology department 
our strategic intent is to enable clinicians to use ultrasound in a variety of clinical settings by developing each potential market based on three fundamental tenets i the design of high performance system hardware  software and transducers with application specific settings and capabilities  ii the provision of educational training that ensures appropriate use of the equipment in the clinical setting  and iii the support of professional institutions and ultrasound thought leaders in the completion of use protocols and clinical research that accelerates the adoption of hcu to improve patient outcomes 
by providing ultrasound at the primary point of care  our systems can eliminate delays associated with the outpatient referral process or moving heavy  cart based systems across hospital departments to scan patients 
this increased accessibility is changing clinical practice  improving patient care and safety and has the potential to reduce healthcare costs through earlier and more rapid diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
we design our products for applications where ultrasound has not typically been used such as emergency medicine  surgery  critical care  internal medicine and vascular access procedures as well as for imaging in traditional applications  such as radiology  cardiology  vascular medicine and obstetrics and gynecology ob gyn 
in addition  the us military has successfully deployed our systems in traditional hospital settings  field hospitals and forward surgical teams in iraq and other areas of conflict 
we began shipping our first products in september and today have an installed based of more than  systems worldwide 
on april   we introduced our newest product  the sonosite micromaxx system micromaxx system 
this system is our third generation product and is based on our proprietary application specific integrated circuit asic technology for high resolution ultrasound imaging and offers image resolution comparable to costly  conventional cart based ultrasound systems weighing over pounds 
our first shipments of the micromaxx system occurred in june the system addresses both traditional and emerging ultrasound markets and includes a standard five year warranty on the system and most of the transducers  a first in the ultrasound industry 
our first generation of products includes the and ilook series 
the sonosite plus system was designed for general ultrasound imaging and the sonoheart elite is specifically configured for cardiovascular applications 
the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual guidance for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures and the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide imaging of the chest and abdomen 
our second generation product  the titan system  began shipping in june this high performance system addresses both traditional and new ultrasound markets and accounted for the majority of our revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include accounts receivable  revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  warranty expense  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become probable or as the estimated loss increases 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer any revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty accrual 
our standard arrangements with distributors do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software  software related elements  and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole  is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we have vendor specific objective evidence  vsoe of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of sonometric health  inc sonometric in we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
discrete financial information is available only for sonosite as a whole  there is no discrete financial information available for sonometric because it was incorporated into sonosite immediately after acquisition 
therefore  sonosite is the reporting unit to which goodwill resulting from the sonometric acquisition is assigned 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology and non compete agreements related to the acquisition of sonometric and reacquired distribution rights related to the acquisition of sonosite china medical limited sonosite china medical 
we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
with respect to definite lived intangible assets  we evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
if we conclude that any indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs as well as management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
in addition  we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the micromaxx system  which we began shipping in june given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for the micromaxx system is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the micromaxx system compared with our other systems and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of those other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for this product 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase significantly due to the five year warranty offered with this product 
should actual failure rates and repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we do not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  foreign nol carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets were recognized on our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of resulting in an income tax benefit 
prior to this time  we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us nols we have incurred 
as required by sfas  we did not recognize any tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to our us operations would be realized 
we have retained a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset resulting from our international operations as they have not sustained consecutive profitability for a reasonable period of time 
we re evaluate our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas  record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards actually used in future quarters 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate us profitability for the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to measure our stock based compensation expense relating to option grants to employees under our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we record no compensation expense when we grant stock options to employees if the exercise price for a fixed stock option award granted to an employee is equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date we grant the stock option 
a different method for accounting for employee stock option grants is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  a company is required to determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on an option pricing model which incorporates such factors as the current stock price  exercise price of the options  expected volatility of future movements in the price of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates  the expected term of the options and any dividends expected to be paid 
the fair value determined under this method should then be recognized over the vesting period of the related options 
in addition to option grants  we have granted restricted stock units to certain employees  which were valued at market price at the date of grant 
we are recognizing the fair market value of the restricted stock units granted as compensation expense over the vesting period of the units 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb under sfas r  we will be required to follow a fair value approach using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes option valuation model  at the grant date of an equity based award 
the compensation calculated under the fair value method will then be recognized over the respective vesting period of the stock based award 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r on january  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
also  sfas r will require us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of the expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash flow  which may have a material impact on our future reported cash flows from operating activities 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to the introduction of the micromaxx system in june  which has a higher average selling price and project orders from governmental entities 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased sales in the us and international sales in europe and japan 
united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to changes in our product mix as well as increased direct  us government and distributor sales and increased prices due to micromaxx introduction 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher sales force productivity that was partially offset by a decline in us government and military sales 
international revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales to our distributors in europe and india  and an increase in revenue from direct sales in france and spain that was partially offset by decreases in direct sales to germany 
we have taken steps to improve the situation in germany including hiring a highly respected and experienced ultrasound executive in december who we expect will be able to address the issues that have hindered us in europe s largest market 
changes in exchange rates had minimal impact on revenue in the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the united kingdom and germany and sales to our distributor in italy 
changes in exchange rates accounted for million of the increase in revenue in revenue from canada  south and latin america and asia pacific excluding japan increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales to our distributors in latin america and south america  large government sales in south america and an increase in direct sales in australia and canada 
revenue from japan increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increases in and were primarily due to sales under our exclusive titan distribution arrangement with our distributor  aloka co 
ltd  initial sales under our exclusive ilook system distribution arrangement with our distributor  nippon sherwood medical industries ltd  and commencing direct sales by our new subsidiary during we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to due to continued expansion of our direct selling efforts in the us and europe  the expansion of our direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia  the expansion of our sales operations in china  improvement in the sales operations in germany  introduction of new products and features  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
additionally  the expansion of our sales operations in china may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products there 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 
increased competition may also impact the extent of the increase in our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
some of these competitors have introduced hcu products 
we began shipping the micromaxx system  which incorporates our third generation ultrasound technology  in june and it accounted for of total system revenues during the six month period ended december  users of cart based systems may not accept the micromaxx system  which could discourage widespread new users and uses for them 
our existing customers may not accept the micromaxx system due to pricing and functionality differences 
if demand for the micromaxx system does not meet our projections  we may experience excess inventory levels and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to grow our business 
gross margin gross margin increased to in compared to in and in the increase in compared to was primarily due an improved product mix  improved manufacturing efficiencies and a reduction in the royalty owed to atl  which became effective in september the increase in gross margin in compared to was primarily due to changes in product mix which resulted in increased average selling prices resulting from increased sales of titan systems  improved manufacturing efficiencies due to the increased sales volume  a weaker usd and a reduction in the royalty owed to atl 
we expect our gross margin percentage in to increase slightly from due to changes in product mix which results in increased average selling prices and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors in the portable ultrasound system market could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct  government and distributor sales and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
additionally  we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to expenses associated with the development and enhancements to the micromaxx system  which began shipping in june the increase in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily due to expenses associated with the development of advanced features and accessories for the titan system and the development of the micromaxx system 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in compared to due to development related to our third generation asic technology as well as further development related to the micromaxx system 
however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased compensation for commissions related to the increase in revenue  marketing costs incurred to promote the micromaxx system  and expansion of our international operations 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was primarily due to expansion of our international operations  increased compensation for commissions related to the increase in revenue and costs related to improving our sales processes 
changes in exchange rates accounted for million of the increase in expenses in compared to we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in compared to primarily due to marketing expenses for education and brand awareness  increased compensation for commissions related to the anticipated increase in revenues  expansion of direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia and continued growth in our european subsidiaries 
additionally  we may incur significant expenses in the expansion of our operations in china and india 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to defending our patent rights in the existing neutrino patent infringement litigation  defending ourselves in a dispute with a former distributor and supporting our business growth 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to supporting our business growth  meeting the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and defending our patent rights in the existing neutrino patent infringement litigation 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses  other than share based compensation  will be level in compared to also  we expect to incur substantial additional legal expenses in connection with pending litigation 
in addition  we may incur unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
we anticipate that all research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses will increase due to share based compensation during other income loss total other income loss was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income  which was caused by an increase in the return on our investments due to higher average interest rates during the year 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to net foreign currency losses of million in compared to net gains of million in income tax expense income tax expense was million in  compared to an income tax benefit of million in and no income tax expense or benefit in due to our profitable operations in  we recorded income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and accordingly reflected changes in our deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates 
while this tax expense reduced net income  no cash will be paid for income taxes  other than required alternative minimum tax and foreign and state tax payments  until the nol and tax credits have been fully utilized 
foreign nols will be utilized in jurisdictions where they are available and cash will be paid in jurisdictions that do not have foreign nols 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded for foreign deferred tax assets  based on evaluation of the weight of all positive and negative evidence  including consideration of our transfer pricing methodologies which target arms length profitability at our foreign subsidiaries 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized deferred tax assets resulting in a net income tax benefit of million 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us nols and tax credits we have incurred 
as required by sfas  we did not recognize any tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets would be realized 
we have retained a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting from our international operations and will continue to do so until it is more likely than not the deferred assets will be realized 
we reevaluate our ability to realize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas  record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards actually used in future quarters as well as the reversing affect of temporary differences 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term and long term investment securities totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  investment securities consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
operating activities used cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and cash used of million in the cash used in compared to was primarily due to an increase in receivables resulting from increased sales and a decrease in accounts payable that were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and our non cash deferred tax benefit 
the cash provided in compared to was primarily due to the generation of a net income in compared to a net loss in  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased business activity 
these increases were partially offset by our non cash deferred tax benefit  increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support our business growth  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due to  among other things  an increased cash deposit for a value added tax guarantee by our u 
k subsidiary 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations will increase in compared to a use of cash in primarily due to anticipated continued profitable operations 
this increase will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
our cash flow from operations will also be impacted by excess income tax benefits on stock options  which are required to be classified as cash provided by financing activities when we adopt sfas r in the first quarter of investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily due to million of net sales maturities of investments in compared to million of net purchases of investment securities in additionally  cash used in investing activities decreased as a result of a reduction in purchases of property and equipment and a reduction in acquisition activities 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily due to million of net purchases of investments in compared to million of net purchases of investment securities in these reductions in cash used were partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment and acquisition activities in compared to we anticipate using cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will depend on the interest rate environment during the period and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the period 
financing activities provided cash of million in compared to million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million in compared to million in and million in we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash due to any significant decline in our revenue or gross margin  any delay or inability to collect accounts receivable  any acquisition or strategic investment in another business  any significant increase in expenditures as a result of expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  our manufacturing capability or our product development activities  any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenditures as a result of our introduction of new products  and any significant increase in expenditures related to the neutrino patent infringement litigation 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet debt  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
furthermore  except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below  we are not a party to any derivative transaction 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees give rise only to the disclosure provisions of fin to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  
sonosite kxxjpg 
other commitments in  we entered into an agreement to contribute up to million to a research university 
this pledge  which is to be paid over a four year period  is conditioned upon our election to make a payment on an annual basis 
we paid million in during  we elected to contribute million 
as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
as part of obtaining our lease for our current facility  we were required to deposit million  representing restricted cash with our bank 
also  we were required to maintain a deposit of million with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
both amounts are included in other long term assets and are not included in the table above 
in the us  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare gpos 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
currently  we have gpo supply agreements with various groups including amerinet  inc  premier  inc  novation llc  medassets hsca  inc  broadlane  inc 
includes kaiser permanente  tenet healthcare and others and consorta  inc these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of million in  million in and million in recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas r applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments 
sfas r requires us to follow a fair value approach using an option pricing model at the grant date of a stock based award 
the compensation calculated under the fair value method will then be recognized over the respective vesting period of the stock based award 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we will apply the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period 
also  sfas r will require us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash flow  which may have a material impact on our future reported cash flows from operating activities 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and sab and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share beginning in the first quarter of our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact resulting in uncertainty as to whether future stock based compensation expense will be similar to the historical sfas pro forma expense 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas  as applicable  beginning in fiscal in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated

in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
the fsp addresses determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and measuring an impairment loss 
the fsp also addresses the accounting after an entity recognizes an other than temporary impairment  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that the entity did not recognize as other than temporary impairments 
we are required to adopt the fsp at the beginning of fiscal and do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of more than one year 
we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity  however  we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international subsidiaries  which may result in foreign exchange losses on transactions with them  and our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them 
as of december   of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are warranted in order to mitigate our collection risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts expire on march  and serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the usd 
these foreign currencies primarily include the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
any gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts would be largely mitigated by offsetting losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was million 
as of december   we had no foreign currency forward contracts
