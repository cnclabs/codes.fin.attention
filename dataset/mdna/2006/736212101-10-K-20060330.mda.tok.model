in the united kingdom  we operate and serve our customers in two markets 
the united kingdom s rail business  which comprised approximately of total sales for the years ended  and  is primarily driven by sales of friction management products and services to the united kingdom passenger rail network 
for the years ended december   and  this segment s two largest rail customers represented  and of total external sales  respectively 
over the same time period described above  our material handling business represented approximately of the total sales generated by our united kingdom segment 
our major product lines in this market include overhead and floor conveyor systems  racking systems and mezzanine flooring systems 
the end users of our products are primarily united kingdom based companies in the manufacturing  distribution  garment and food industries 
as our material handling products are primarily dependent upon the capital spending plans of manufacturers  our largest customers vary each year depending upon the contracts that are secured 
for the years ended december   and  our two largest material handling customers represented  and of total external sales  respectively 
year ended december  in thousands external sales intersegment sales operating income average translation rate of british pound sterling to united states dollar sales by product line material handling products friction management products and services total product and service sales includes intersegment sales 
for the year ended december   external sales at our united kingdom operation declined by million or  to million from million during the comparable period in of this decline   is attributable to lower customer demand  primarily for our material handling products  as this product line is dependent on capital spending by original equipment manufacturers  while  is due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation of british pounds sterling into us dollars 
operating income for the year ended december  increased to  from  during the comparable period in  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses such as professional fees  research and development expenses  insurance premiums  and sales commissions during the year ended december  for the year ended december   external sales at our united kingdom operation of million increased by million or  from million during the same period in this increase in external sales is attributable to a favorable foreign currency translation of approximately million  partially offset by a slight sales volume decrease 
this sales volume decrease is primarily due to lower demand for our friction management products and services  as a result of our largest customer  network rail  undergoing a significant reorganization that began during the latter part of and carried into the decrease in sales of our friction management products and services was offset by an increase in sales of our material handling products resulting from increased customer demand of our overhead and floor conveyor systems 
operating income of  for the year ended december  was consistent with the same period in as the increased sales volume of our material handling product line was partially offset by the decrease in our higher margin friction management sales 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for internal growth  capital expenditures  repayments of long term contractual obligations  dividends to our shareholders and other commercial commitments 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
our total cash balance is million at december  we may use this cash for acquisitions  product line expansions or general corporate purposes 
in addition to cash generated from operations  we have revolving and overdraft credit facilities in place to support the working capital needs of each of our business segments 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the ability to borrow additional cash under our credit and overdraft facilities along with our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and growth objectives over the next twelve months

for the year ended december   we generated million in cash from operating activities compared to million for the year ended december  cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december  includes net income of million  an increase of million from depreciation and amortization expenses increased  for the year ended december   primarily due to amortization expense on intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the kelsan acquisition in november higher inventory and accounts receivable balances  primarily due to higher sales and stronger customer demands  used a combined million of cash in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended december  includes net income of million  an increase of  from net income of million for  and depreciation and amortization expenses of million  an increase of  over in addition  for the year ended december   cash increased  due to lower prepaid expenses and other assets  which were primarily related to legal and accounting costs incurred for the initial public offering of our common stock in january additionally  cash increased by  due to higher accounts payable  primarily due to timing of payments to vendors  during the year ended december  offsetting this increase in cash were increased accounts receivable of million  primarily due to higher sales volume  and increased inventory balances of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million of cash used in investing activities during cash used in investing activities in was for capital expenditures  which totaled million 
capital expenditures upgrade our machinery and equipment  improve our facilities  support new strategic initiatives  or develop new products 
during the third quarter of  we obtained board of director approval to purchase and install an induction furnace for our canadian manufacturing operation near montreal 
we anticipate that this new electric furnace will reduce our operating costs  modernize our operations  improve the plant s air quality and improve our overall performance 
the estimated cost of this project is  and we anticipate that this project will be completed during the second quarter of net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  included million for business acquisitions  along with capital expenditures of million 
the majority of our capital spending is discretionary 
we believe that the overall level of capital spending for our business segments is sufficient to remain competitive

cash provided by financing activities in includes net borrowings on revolving and overdraft credit facilities of  net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
net proceeds received from bank term debt of million were used for the purchase of kelsan in november these sources of cash were partially offset by net repayments on revolving and overdraft credit facilities of million  repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million and cash dividends paid of million 
credit facilities 
our term loan and working capital credit and overdraft facilities are summarized as follows in the united states and canada  we have a million term loan and revolving credit facility with national city bank and its canadian affiliate that provided acquisition financing along with supporting the working capital requirements of our united states business units and our canadian operations 
under this agreement  there are three separate borrowing components  a million united states revolving credit facility  a million million cdn revolving credit facility for our canadian operations  and an outstanding term loan in the original amount of million million cdn 
in december we entered into a new million million cdn revolving credit facility for our canadian operations  which replaced the previous million million cdn revolving credit facility for our canadian operation near montreal  along with replacing the previous overdraft credit facility for kelsan 
as of december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the united states and canadian revolving credit facilities  as the combined borrowings under the total facility cannot exceed million 
this agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a current ratio  cash flow coverage and leverage ratios  and maintain minimum amounts of tangible net worth 
this credit facility further limits capital expenditures  sales of assets  and additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants as of december  for additional details  see note of the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the canadian revolving credit facility was million million cdn 
there were no outstanding borrowings on the us revolving credit facility at december  the balance outstanding on the kelsan acquisition loan was million million cdn at december  in the united kingdom  we have a million  pounds sterling overdraft credit facility with a local financial institution to support the working capital needs of our united kingdom operation 
this credit facility provides for an additional   pounds sterling of availability for the issuance of performance bonds 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december   however  our availability under this credit facility was reduced due to outstanding performance bonds in the amount of   pounds sterling as of december  the overdraft facility is reviewed on an annual basis and has a maturity date of april  summary of contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt future interest payments for long term debt obligations revolving and overdraft credit facilities pension plan contributions purchase obligations capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations assumes that the interest rates on our long term debt agreements at december  see note of the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k will continue for the life of the agreements 
pension plan contributions that may be required more than one year from december  will be dependent upon the performance of plan assets 
financial condition at december   total assets were million  an increase of  from million as of december  this increase in total assets at december  is primarily due to timing differences in cash  accounts receivable and inventory balances  slightly offset by lower net book values of property  plant and equipment balances resulting from depreciation expense in total outstanding debt obligations at december  decreased by approximately million or  to million as of december   from million at december  the decrease in total outstanding debt obligations reflects principal payments on the kelsan acquisition loan with national city bank canada of million and the repayment of term debt of  by our united kingdom operation 
offsetting this decrease is an increase in net borrowings of  on our canadian revolving credit facility 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan that covers a significant number of our united states employees  former employees and retirees 
benefits under the plan were based on years of service for hourly employees 
for salaried employees  benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s average compensation during defined periods of service 
in august  we amended our united states defined benefit plan by freezing the benefits accrued for all participants effective december  and preventing new enrollments after december  our future net periodic pension cost and plan funding will be dependent upon the performance of plan assets 
we also maintain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom that cover certain active employees  former employees and retirees 
benefits under the plans were based on years of service and eligible compensation during defined periods of service 
in september  we amended these plans by freezing the benefits accrued for all participants effective december  the products we manufacture and sell  such as our joint bars  rail anchors and rail spikes  require steel as a major element in the production process 
beginning in  worldwide steel prices spiked upwards resulting in surcharges being added to our overall raw material costs 
as a result  these steel surcharges increased our raw material costs 
while these higher material costs have had some negative impact on our financial results for the years ended december  and  particularly on our track component product lines  we believe the impact of the higher material costs has not had a material impact on our overall financial results 
although we have been successful in passing through most of the steel surcharges on to our customers  we have been able to do so at no added profit 
if a prolonged increase in steel prices should continue and we are unable to pass on these added costs to our customers  our future earnings could be negatively impacted 
discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are delivered and title has passed or when service is performed 
delivery is determined by our shipping terms  which are primarily fob shipping point 
shipments are made only under a valid contract or purchase order where the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of returns  discounts and other allowances 
revenue from installation of material handling equipment and railway wayside data collection and data management systems is generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each contract to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
the length of each contract varies  but is typically about two to five months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date  to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  repairs and depreciation costs 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is immediately recorded in the accounting period that the loss is determined 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of total costs or revenue during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision first become known 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain a reserve to absorb probable losses relating to bad debts arising from uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we consider adequate to absorb probable bad debts inherent in the accounts receivable balance and is based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of the collectability  historical loss experience of accounts receivable and the financial status of customers with accounts receivable balances 
bad debts are charged and recoveries are credited to the reserve when incurred 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because we have a significant concentration of accounts receivable in the rail industry 
the economic conditions could affect our customers ability to pay and changes in the estimate could have a material effect on net income 
inventories 
we establish obsolescence reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
obsolescence reserves reduce the carrying value of slow moving and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value  which generally approximates the recoverable scrap value 
we utilize historical usage  our experience  current backlog and forecasted usage to evaluate our reserve amounts 
we also periodically evaluate our inventory carrying value to ensure that the amounts are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the goodwill of each of our reporting units for impairment as required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our judgment 
factors that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include  but are not limited to  different assumptions used to forecast future revenue  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models 
in addition  selection of a risk adjusted discount rate on the estimated undiscounted cash flow is susceptible to future changes in market conditions and when unfavorable  can adversely affect our original estimates of fair values 
since adoption of sfas  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
as part of the acquisitions of salient systems and kelsan  we recorded the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the companies in accordance with sfas no 
as part of our procedures to assign fair values to all acquired assets  we hired an independent appraiser to evaluate the technology and intellectual property along with any other intangible assets that we could assign a fair value to under both of these acquisitions 
we supplied the independent appraiser with the historical and estimated cash flows of the companies along with an estimate of future costs to maintain these technologies 
the independent appraiser used these estimates and other assumptions to determine the present value of the discounted cash flows of these various technologies 
in addition  we evaluated the future lives of the identified intangible assets to determine if they have definite or indefinite lives 
as a result of the salient systems acquisition  we assigned a fair value to their wheel impact load detector and rail stress monitor in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we also determined that there was million of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we determined that the intangible assets under the salient systems acquisition had indefinite lives due to our plans to make continual enhancements to the technology and related products  such that some generation of this technology could be in use for as long as railroads operate 
in the future  we will monitor these intangible assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives to become definite and thereby assign a future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and then record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
as a result of the kelsan acquisition  we assigned a fair value to their stick friction modifier product line and the keltrack liquid friction modifier product line in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we also determined that there was million of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we have estimated that the stick friction modifier product technology and keltrack liquid friction modifier product technology have definite lives of years and years due to our estimates that the projected economic earnings associated with these technology based product lines will begin to lapse after these time frames 
in the future  we will monitor these assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives assigned to these intangible assets to become shorter than originally assigned  and thereby  we would assign a shorter future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover a significant number of our active employees  former employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the liabilities and expenses for pensions require significant judgments and estimates 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  inflation  the long term rate of return on plan assets and mortality tables 
management has mitigated the future liability for active employees by freezing all defined benefit pension plans effective december  the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds that could be used to settle obligations of the plan 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations 
the effects of actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense 
as interest rates decline  the actuarially calculated pension plan liability increases 
conversely  as interest rates increase  the actuarially calculated pension liability decreases 
past declines in interest rates and equity markets have had a negative impact on the pension plan liability and fair value of our plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at december   and  which resulted in an   and  net of tax  respectively  charge to other comprehensive loss 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as a company with international operations  we record an estimated liability or benefit for our current income tax provision and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
we do not believe that such a charge would be material 
the process of recording deferred tax assets and liabilities involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense is recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our experience  current economic situation and budgets 
we believe that operations will provide taxable income levels to recover the deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our contractual long term debt obligations and our working capital facilities are under floating interest rate arrangements 
however  we have determined that these risks are not significant enough to warrant hedging programs 
if interest rates increase  we will be exposed to higher interest rates and we will be required to use more cash to settle our long term debt obligations 
as interest rates increase on our variable long term debt  it will have a negative impact on future earnings because the increased rates will increase our interest expense 
conversely  if interest rates decrease on our variable long term debt  it will have a positive impact on future earnings because the lower rates will decrease our interest expense 
based upon the long term debt amount as of december   for every increase or decrease in the interest rate on our long term debt  our annual interest expense will fluctuate by approximately  in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations with our two international operations 
we do not have any foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures 
therefore  we are exposed to the related effects when the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate 
if the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar and or the british pound sterling  the translation rate for these foreign currencies will decrease  which will have a negative impact on our operating income 
for example  for the year ended december   for every change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar  our canadian operation s operating income would have changed by approximately  further  for every change in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling to the us dollar  the impact on operating income for our united kingdom operations for the year ended december  would have been approximately  foreign currency translation fluctuations have no impact on cash flows as long as we continue to reinvest any profits back into the respective foreign operations
