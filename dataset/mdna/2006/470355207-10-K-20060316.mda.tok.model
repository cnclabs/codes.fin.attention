item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including the risks discussed in risk factors in this filing 
overview we mine  process and sell bituminous  steam and industrial grade coal through six operating subsidiaries mining complexes located throughout eastern kentucky and in southern indiana 
we have two reportable business segments based on the coal basins in which we operate central appalachia capp and the midwest midwest 
our midwest business segment was added in through the acquisition of triad mining  inc in  our mines produced million tons of coal including  tons of contract coal and we purchased another  tons for resale 
of the million tons we produced from company operated mines  approximately came from underground mines  while the remaining came from surface mines 
in  we generated revenues of million and a net loss of million 
prices for coal have increased significantly since mid due to a combination of conditions in the us and worldwide that caused a shortage of certain grades of coal 
consequently  we have seen significant increases in both spot coal prices and in the prices of our long term contracts to sell coal during that time 
we believe that coal prices will continue to remain near their current level 
the fixed price contractual commitments that we have with certain utility customers mitigate short term swings in spot coal prices up or down 
capp segment in central appalachia  the majority of our coal is primarily sold to customers in the southern portion of the south atlantic region of the united states 
the south atlantic region includes the states of florida  georgia  south carolina  north carolina  west virginia  virginia  maryland and delaware 
according to the us energy information administration eia  in the south atlantic region consumed about of all coal for electric generation in the united states 
the south atlantic region had an increase in coal consumption in the electric power sector of in we have been providing coal to customers in the south atlantic region since our formation in in  georgia power and south carolina public service authority were our largest customers  representing approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
according to the eia  coal productions increased in the appalachia region by in  but remained lower than the production levels 
production increases in the appalachia regions continue to be impacted by transportation problems  rising operating costs and difficulty in permitting new mines 
during  our capp segment shipped million tons of coal 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
based on our most recent analysis prepared by marshall miller associates  inc mm a on march   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and an average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
our capp segment experienced a significant increase in mining costs during the increased costs were primarily due to higher royalties due to an increase in sales price and severance taxes  labor costs  commodity based variable mining costs  and trucking costs 
we are focused on reducing our operating costs at each mine and improving miner productivity 
we continue to select projects for capital expenditures for equipment  facilities  and infrastructure that we believe will provide high returns 
we are also focused on enhancing our training programs to help our personnel be safer and more productive 
midwest segment in the midwest  the majority of our coal is sold in the east north central region  which includes the states of illinois  indiana  ohio  michigan and wisconsin 
according to the eia  in the east north central region consumed about of all coal consumed for electric generation in the united states 
the east north central region had an increase in coal consumption for the electric power sector of in in  our midwest segment s largest customer was indianapolis power and light which represented approximately of our total revenues 
during which includes the period subsequent to may   our midwest segment shipped million tons of coal 
we believe that coal fired electric utilities value the high energy coal that comprises the majority of our midwest reserves 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
based on our most recent analysis prepared by mm a as of february   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
reserves mm a prepared a detailed study of our capp reserves as of march  based on all of our geologic information  including our updated drilling and mining data 
mm a completed their report on our capp reserves in june in connection with our acquisition of triad  mm a also prepared a detailed study of our midwest reserves as of february   based on similar data from triad 
mm a completed their report on our midwest reserves in march the coal reserve studies conducted by mm a were planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance of the subject demonstrated reserves 
in connection with the studies  mm a prepared reserve maps and had certified professional geologists develop estimates based on data supplied by us and triad using standards accepted by government and industry 
we have used mm a s march  study as the basis for our current internal estimate of our central appalachia reserves and mm a s february  study as the basis for our current internal estimate of our midwest reserves 
reserves for these purposes are defined by sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the reserve estimates were prepared using industry standard methodology to provide reasonable assurance that the reserves are recoverable  considering technical  economic and legal limitations 
although mm a has reviewed our reserves and found them to be reasonable notwithstanding unforeseen geological  market  labor or regulatory issues that may affect the operations  by assignment  mm a has not performed an economic feasibility study for our reserves 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we have performed our own economic feasibility analysis for our assigned reserves 
it is not generally considered to be practical  however  nor is it standard industry practice  to perform a feasibility study for a company s entire reserve portfolio 
in addition  mm a did not independently verify our control of our properties  and has relied solely on property information supplied by us and triad 
reserve acreage  average seam thickness  average seam density and average mine and wash recovery percentages were verified by mm a to prepare a reserve tonnage estimate for each reserve 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves as discussed in critical accounting estimates coal reserves 
based on the mm a reserve studies and the foregoing assumptions and qualifications  and after giving effect to our operations from the respective dates of the studies through december   we estimate that  as of december   we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the capp region and millions tons in the midwest region 
the following table provides additional information regarding changes to our reserves since december  in millions of tons capp midwest total proven and probable reserves  as of december  coal extracted acquisitions adjustments proven and probable reserves  as of december  calculated in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
proven reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings  or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspections  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
this reserve information reflects recoverable tonnage on an as received basis with moisture 
represents estimated reserves on properties acquired during the relevant period 
we calculated the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but  except for the reserve study of the triad reserves as of february   these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to additional information obtained from exploration activities  production activities or discovery of new geologic information 
we calculated the adjustments to the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
key performance indicators we manage our business through several key performance metrics that provide a summary of information in the areas of sales  operations  and general and administrative costs 
in the sales area  our long term metrics are the volume weighted average remaining term of our contracts and our open contract position for the next several years 
during periods of high prices  such as the current period  we may seek to lengthen the average remaining term of our contracts and reduce the open tonnage for future periods 
in the short term  we closely monitor the average selling price per ton asp  and the mix between our spot sales and contract sales 
in the operations area  we monitor the volume of coal that is produced by each of our principal sources  including company mines  contract mines  and purchased coal sources 
for our company mines  we focus on both operating costs and operating productivity 
we closely monitor the cost per ton of our mines against our budgeted costs and against our other mines 
in the selling  general and administrative area  we closely monitor the gross dollars spent per mine operation and in support functions 
we also regularly measure our performance against our internally prepared budgets 
trends in our business we expect coal prices to remain near their current levels in the near term 
however  historically high coal prices have caused an increased production that has resulted in downward pressures on coal prices 
we believe that the impact of this potentially increased production will be offset by the need of utilities to rebuild diminished coal inventories resulting from service difficulties that the major railroads have experienced 
according to the energy information administration eia  coal stockpiles at utilities dropped by in any effort by the utilities to rebuild their inventory positions should absorb a portion of any increased coal production 
continuing difficulties with rail transportation may also have an impact on increased production and market pricing 
if marginal increases in the production of coal cannot be delivered to the utility customers by rail in a timely manner  the depressing effect of the increased production on market prices will be reduced 
in addition  any new coal production would likely require additional permits  labor and equipment  which are currently difficult and time consuming to obtain 
although the current pricing environment for us coal is strong  coal prices are subject to change based on a number of factors beyond our control  including the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity  the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the domestic and foreign steel industries  the cost of transporting coal to the customer  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  air emission standards for coal fired power plants  and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation 
as discussed previously  our costs of production have continued to increase 
we expect the higher costs to continue for the next several years  due to a highly competitive market for a limited supply of skilled mining personnel and higher costs in worldwide commodity markets 
we are actively recruiting and training new personnel to staff our mines 
however  we expect the strong demand for coal labor to continue leading to higher costs for employees that we retain 
our industry has also experienced increased mining costs due to significant price increases for various commodities  including steel and diesel fuel 
we expect that these increases in commodity prices will moderate in the recent mine disasters in west virginia and other states have also resulted in increased scrutiny of coal mining in general and underground coal mining in particular 
we expect that the increased scrutiny will result in new regulations which we believe will cause our and other coal companies mining costs to rise 
reorganization in march  we and all of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions with the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of tennessee for reorganization under chapter our plan of reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in april on may   our plan of reorganization became effective  and we emerged from chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
our implementation of fresh start accounting pursuant to sop resulted in material changes to our consolidated financial statements  including the valuation of our assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with principles of purchase accounting  and the valuation of equity based on a valuation of our business prepared by our independent financial advisors 
as a result of the reorganization transactions and the implementation of fresh start accounting  our results of operations after our emergence from bankruptcy are those of a new reporting entity the successor company  and are not comparable to the results of operations of the pre emergence company the predecessor company for prior periods described in this management s discussion and analysis and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
financial statements for periods after march  and prior to april  include the effects of our bankruptcy proceedings 
these include the classification of certain liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise  the classification of certain expenses  and gains and losses as reorganization items  and other matters described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  in order to provide a basis for comparing the year ended december  with the year ended december   the operating results of the successor company for the eight months ended december  have been combined with the operating results for the predecessor company for the four months ended april   for purposes of the following table and discussion 
the combining of the predecessor and successor accounting periods is not permitted by us generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  as explained above  the operating results of the successor company and the predecessor company are not comparable 
additionally  the company s results of operations include the impact of the triad acquisition subsequent to may  the following table shows selected operating results for and in s year ended december  change total per ton total per ton total volume shipped tons coal sales synfuel handling cost of coal sold depreciation  depletion and amortization gross profit selling  general and administrative volume and revenues by segment year ended december  capp midwest capp midwest volume shipped tons coal sales revenue average sales price per ton in  we shipped million tons of coal compared to million tons for the same period in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of triad which added million tons in coal sales revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in the average sales price per ton for sales under long term contracts and spot sales in capp and a million increase due to the acquisition of triad 
in  the capp region sold approximately million tons of coal under long term contracts of total capp sales volume at an average selling price of per ton 
in  the capp region sold million tons of coal of total capp sales volume under long term contracts at an average selling price of per ton 
in  the capp region sold million tons of coal of total capp sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
in  the capp region sold approximately million tons of total capp sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
the midwest revenues were primarily from sales under long term contracts 
year ended december  capp midwest corporate capp midwest corporate cost of coal sold per ton depreciation  depletion  and amortization per ton cost of coal sold the cost of coal sold  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from million in to million in our cost per ton of coal sold in the capp region increased from per ton in the period to per ton in the period 
this increase in cost per ton of coal sold was due to several factors 
for production from our company operated mines  sales related costs primarily royalties and severance taxes increased by per ton as a result of increased sales prices 
labor and benefit costs increased at our company operated mines by per ton in the period due to a wage increase to all production employees  effective january  the competitive job market in the coal industry necessitated this increase 
variable costs increased by per ton  primarily due to rising commodity prices for petroleum and steel based products such as belting  roof support materials  mining bits and machine parts 
trucking costs increased by per ton in due to higher fuel costs 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase per ton in the cost of our purchased coal of per ton and our contract coal of per ton 
cost per ton of coal sold in the midwest region was in depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased from million in to million in in the capp region  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million or per ton 
these expenses are not comparable due to the impact of fresh start accounting on our asset base 
in the midwest  depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per ton  which reflects the depreciation  depletion and amortization from the acquisition of triad 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for of this increase million was related to an increase in compensation  salary and benefit costs 
we have added an entire team of employees dedicated to the development of our new surface mines 
this team includes technical  operations  and land acquisition personnel to acquire additional properties  design the new mines  obtain all necessary permits  and manage the new mine operations 
an additional  was related to an increase in stock compensation costs primarily reflecting the additional restricted shares issued in bank charges also increased by million  primarily reflecting fees related to our letter of credit facility 
the company also had a  increase in other taxes primarily related to an increase in the unmined mineral tax rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was 
our effective income tax rate is impacted by percentage depletion 
percentage depletion is an income tax deduction that is limited to a percentage of taxable income from each of our mining properties 
because percentage depletion can be deducted in excess of cost depletion  it creates a permanent difference and directly impacts the effective tax rate 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate may occur due to the varying levels of profitability and thus  taxable income and percentage depletion at each of our mine locations 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  in order to provide a basis for comparing the year ended december  with the year ended december   the operating results of the successor company for the eight months ended december  have been combined with the operating results for the predecessor company for the four months ended april   for purposes of the following table and discussion 
the combining of the predecessor and successor accounting periods is not permitted by us generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  as explained above  the operating results of the successor company and the predecessor company are not comparable 
the following table shows selected operating results for and in s change volume tons revenues coal sales synfuel handling cost of coal sold volume and revenues we shipped million tons of coal in and million tons in production from our company mines decreased by approximately  tons in as compared to this decrease in production from our company mines was due to adverse geological conditions at several of our mines and several major moves of mining equipment and personnel in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  there was a reduction during the year of or  tons from contract mining operations 
this reduction in coal obtained from contract mining operations is attributed to several underground mine contractors terminating our contract mine agreements to seek higher priced opportunities with our competitors or closing operations due to depletion of reserves 
we also experienced a decrease of  or  tons  in coal purchased by us for resale 
the reduction in coal purchased for resale from third parties is the result of the increased competition for purchased coal 
we continue to be challenged in replacing contract mine operators and purchased coal sources due to the continued strong coal market 
coal sales revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in spot coal sales  which commanded a higher price in than in  as well as an increase in the average sales price per ton for sales under long term contracts 
for the year ended december   we sold million tons of coal under long term contracts of total sales volume at an average selling price of per ton 
for  we sold million tons of coal under long term contracts of total sales volume at an average selling price of per ton 
the increase in average selling price from to was due to the renegotiation of below market contract prices as part of our bankruptcy proceedings 
for the year ended december   we sold million tons of coal of total sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
for  we sold  tons of coal of total sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
revenues related to the handling  loading and shipping of synfuel increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we processed and shipped less coal as synfuel in than we processed and shipped in however  our fees  on a per ton basis  increased during the same period 
operating costs the cost of coal sold  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased from million in to million in  even though the amount of coal we shipped decreased by million tons 
our cost per ton of coal sold increased from per ton in to per ton in this increase in cost per ton of coal sold was due to several factors 
for production from our company operated mines  sales related costs primarily royalties and severance taxes increased by per ton as a result of increased sales prices 
labor and benefit costs for those tons increased by per ton in primarily due to lower productivity at several mines 
the labor and benefit costs were partially offset by a reduction in workers compensation costs of million  or per ton  during the fourth quarter of  reflecting improved actuarial trends 
variable costs increased by per ton  primarily due to higher roof support and machine parts costs primarily related to the increased cost of steel 
in addition  the cost of coal produced by independent contract mine operators of our tonnage increased by per ton while the cost of coal purchased from outside parties for resale of our tonnage increased by per ton for the period 
the application of fresh start accounting required that we increase the value of our inventory by approximately million on april  this adjustment increased our cost of coal sold and reduced gross profit during the eight months ended december  by a corresponding amount 
for the year ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased from million in to million in on a per ton basis  depreciation  depletion and amortization was in and in this decrease was primarily due to the impact of fresh start accounting on our asset base 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in certain costs due to our exit from bankruptcy 
this decrease was offset by approximately million of stock based compensation expense recorded in we had no stock based compensation expense in liquidity and capital resources in may  we issued million shares of common stock at per share and million of senior notes due on june  the senior notes 
the net proceeds of million from the senior notes and the concurrent equity offering were used to repay existing debt  to fund our acquisition of triad and for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes are unsecured and accrue interest at per annum 
interest payments on the senior notes are required semi annually 
we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after june  at redemption prices from in to in in addition  at any time prior to june   we may redeem up to of the principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of a public equity offering at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes limit our ability  among other things  to pay cash dividends 
in addition  if a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture  each holder of the senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to of their principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
concurrent with the senior notes and equity offering  we entered into a senior secured credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility the revolver and a million letter of credit facility the letter of credit facility 
the revolver matures on may  and the letter of credit facility matures on november  the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
we entered into an amendment and waiver to the senior secured credit facility on february  the first amendment 
the material terms of the senior secured credit facility and the first amendment are described below 
proceeds from the revolver are available for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 
the revolver bears an interest rate per annum equal to a rate based on the our leverage ratio the applicable rate plus our option of either i the greater of a the prime rate or b the federal funds open rate plus or ii a euro rate as defined in the credit agreement 
the applicable rate ranges from to for borrowing based on the prime rate or federal funds open rate and to for borrowing based on the euro rate 
pursuant to the first amendment  the applicable rate was increased to for borrowings based on the prime rate or federal funds open rate and for borrowing based on the euro rate for the period from february  to september  the revolver also requires a commitment fee on the unused balance of the revolver 
the letter of credit facility does not constitute a loan to us and accordingly is not available for borrowing by us 
the letter of credit facility only supports the issuance of up to million of letters of credit by us 
we pay a per annum fee on the full balance of the letter of credit facility and an additional annual fee on the average balance of letter of credits issued under the letter of credit facility 
pursuant to the first amendment  the per annum fee on the full balance of the letter of credit facility was increased to from february  to september with the exception of certain permitted transactions  the senior secured credit facility requires mandatory repayments or reductions in the amount of of the net proceeds of any sale or issuance of equity securities  of the net proceeds of any incurrence of certain indebtedness and of the net proceeds of any sale or other disposition of any assets 
voluntary prepayments are permitted at any time 
the senior secured credit facility and the senior notes contain financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  leverage ratio  senior secured leverage ratio and maximum annual limits on capital expenditures 
our debt covenants also prohibit payment of cash dividends 
as a result of our lower than expected operating results in the fourth quarter  we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio and exceeded the maximum annual limits on capital expenditure required by the senior secured credit facility as of december  the first amendment waived these financial covenants of the senior secured credit facility as of december  and revised certain covenants during to levels that we project we will be able to comply with during the following chart reflects the components of our debt as of december  and december  december  senior notes senior secured credit facility revolver prior senior secured credit facility term loan prior term credit facility total long term debt less amounts classified as current total long term debt  less current maturities as of december   we had available liquidity of approximately million 
this consisted of unrestricted cash on hand of approximately million and availability under the revolver of our senior secured credit facility of approximately million 
our primary source of cash is expected to be sales of coal to our utility and industrial customers 
the price of coal received can change dramatically based on supply and demand and will directly affect this source of cash 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of ordinary mining expenses to mine coal  capital expenditures and benefit payments 
ordinary mining expenses are driven by the cost of supplies  including steel prices and diesel fuel 
benefit payments include payments for workers compensation and black lung benefits paid over the lives of our employees as the claims are submitted 
we are required to pay these when due  and are not required to set aside cash for these payments 
we have posted surety bonds with state regulatory departments to guarantee these payments and have issued letters of credit to secure these bonds 
we believe that our letter of credit facility provides us with the ability to meet the necessary bonding requirements 
our secondary source of cash is the revolver 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from our operating activities  and availability under the revolver component of our senior secured credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  to fund our capital expenditures for existing operations and to meet our debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
nevertheless  there are many factors beyond our control  including general economic and coal market conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our liquidity needs 
in the event that the sources of cash described above are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements  we will need to reduce certain planned expenditures  seek additional financing  or both 
if debt financing is not available on favorable terms  we may seek to raise funds through the issuance of our equity securities 
if such actions are not sufficient  we may need to limit our growth  reduce or curtail some of our operations to levels consistent with the constraints imposed by our available cash flow  or both 
our ability to seek additional debt or equity financing may be limited by our existing and any future financing arrangements  economic and financial conditions  or both 
in particular  our senior notes and new senior secured credit facility  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot provide assurance that any reductions in our planned expenditures or in our expansion would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
other than ordinary course of business expenses and capital expenditures for existing mines during the next several years  our only large expected use of cash are discussed below in the project development section 
we expect that such expenditures will be funded through cash on hand  cash generated by operations and from our senior secured credit facility 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  was offset by a million increase in cash from our operating assets and liabilities 
this change was primarily caused by increase in accounts payables of million due to timing of certain projects as compared with the prior year 
net cash used by investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the change was primarily due to the acquisition of triad for million and an increase in capital expenditures of million as compared to capital expenditures primarily consisted of new and replacement mine equipment including new surface mine equipment and various projects to improve the production and efficiency of our mining operations including mine at the mccoy complex 
our cash used by investing activities in was million  including million of capital expenditures  offset by million of proceeds from the sale of investments and an increase in restricted cash 
net cash provided by or used in financing activities primarily reflects changes in short and long term financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we received million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which was offset by a repayment of our previously outstanding debt 
during  we received million in proceeds  less million capitalized debt issuance costs  from our credit facility 
during  we also borrowed and repaid million under our debtor in possession loan 
we had no proceeds from borrowings and had million in principal payments during the year ended december  contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations royalty obligations purchase obligations consists of interest payments on our senior notes 
capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 
royalty obligations include minimum royalties payable on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of ten years 
certain coal leases require payment based on minimum tonnage  for these contracts an average sales price of was used to project the future commitment 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase coal that include fixed quantities or minimum amounts and a fixed price provision 
they do not include agreements to purchase coal with vendors that do not include quantities or minimum tonnages  or monthly purchase orders 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension  workers compensation  black lung  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flow  results of operations or financial condition from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation and other miscellaneous obligations 
at december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment  collection bonds  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
we also use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credits were issued under our letter of credit facility 
critical accounting estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the estimates and judgments we make in connection with our consolidated financial statements are based on historical experience and various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements lists and describes our significant accounting policies 
the following critical accounting policies have a material affect on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation our most significant long term obligation is the obligation to provide workers compensation benefits 
we are liable under various state statutes for providing workers compensation benefits 
to fulfill these obligations  we have used self insurance programs with varying excess insurance levels  and  since june   a high deductible  fully insured program 
the high deductible  fully insured program is comparable to a self insured program where the excess insurance threshold equals the deductible level 
in june of  we became self insured for workers compensation for our kentucky operations 
we accrue for the present value of certain workers compensation obligations as calculated by an independent actuary based upon assumptions for work related injury and illness rates  discount rates and future trends for medical care costs 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our workers compensation obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if the estimates do not materialize as anticipated  our actual costs and cash expenditures could differ materially from that currently estimated 
our estimated workers compensation liability as of december  was million 
coal miners pneumoconiosis we are required under the federal mine safety and health act of  as amended  as well as various state statutes  to provide pneumoconiosis black lung benefits to eligible current and former employees and their dependents 
we provide these benefits through self insurance programs and  for those claims incurred with last exposure after june   a high deductible  fully insured program 
an independent actuary has calculated the estimated pneumoconiosis liability based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our black lung obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  the actual costs and cash expenditures could vary materially from the amount currently estimated 
our estimated pneumoconiosis liability as of december  was million 
defined benefit pension the estimated cost and benefits of our non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with our review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was 
significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was for the year ended december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense was for the year ended december  significant changes to these rates would introduce substantial volatility to our pension expense 
our accrued pension obligation as of december  was million 
reclamation and mine closure obligation the surface mining control reclamation act of establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining 
our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering estimates related to these requirements 
u 
s generally accepted accounting principles require that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
our management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate is based on interest rates of bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
the actual costs could be different due to several reasons  including the possibility that our estimates could be incorrect  in which case our liabilities would differ 
if we perform the reclamation work using our personnel rather than hiring a third party  as assumed under us generally accepted accounting principles  then the costs should be lower 
if governmental regulations change  then the costs of reclamation will be impacted 
us generally accepted accounting principles recognize that the recorded liability could be different than the final cost of the reclamation and addresses the settlement of the liability 
when the obligation is settled  and there is a difference between the recorded liability and the amount of cash paid to settle the obligation  a gain or loss upon settlement is included in earnings 
our asset retirement obligation as of december  was million 
contingencies we are the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
we have accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes statement no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
statement no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income 
we have also considered  but not relied upon  tax planning strategies in determining the deferred tax asset that will ultimately be realized 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the amount of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
at december   we had a million valuation allowance that was established against net operating losses nols and alternate minimum tax carryforwards that were expected to be lost due to our emergence from bankruptcy or that we expected to expire unused 
during  we reduced the tax basis of these assets and eliminated the related valuation allowance 
as of december   we had no valuation allowance recorded for deferred tax assets 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our staff and analyzed by marshall miller associates  inc a number of sources of information were used to determine accurate recoverable reserves estimates  including all currently available data  our own operational experience and that of our consultants  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  previously completed geological and reserve studies  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances could be material 
in particular  a variance in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our annual expense for depreciation  depletion and amortization and on our annual calculation for potential impairment

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and fas r  which we will adopt on january  fas r provides additional guidance on accounting for stock based compensation and will require companies to measure such awards at fair value in the income statement on a prospective basis 
we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
we estimate that as a result of the adoption of fas r  we will recognize incremental compensation expense for the year ended december  of less than  net of taxes  for stock options that are outstanding at december  the company does not believe that fas r will significantly impact its accounting for restricted stock awards 
other supplemental information labor and turnover recruiting  hiring  and retaining skilled mine production personnel has become challenging during the past several years 
this is due to the aging of the industry workforce and the availability of other suitable positions for potential employees 
the current strong market prices have also contributed to a higher level of turnover as competing coal mining companies attempt to increase production 
based on average employment of production personnel in central appalachia  our gross turnover has been approximately during the twelve months ended december  our net turnover in central appalachia during this period  after considering employees that have left and been rehired  is approximately 
we believe that our retention of employees is equal to  or better  than other coal mining companies in our operating area 
we are actively working to improve our results in this area including the payment of safety incentives that we believe will further reduce our employee turnover and improve employee relations 
sales commitments as of december   we had the following contractual commitments including long term and short term contracts to ship coal at a fixed and known price year ended year ended year ended year ended average price per ton tons average price per ton tons average price per ton tons average price per ton tons capp midwest a a certain contracts in the midwest include a customer option to increase or decrease the stated tons in the contract 
we have included option tons that we believe will be exercised based on current market prices 
the prices for the midwest in years to are minimum base price amounts that will be adjusted for fuel escalators 
the escalators in associated with the tons committed for to range from to 
however  there can be no assurances future adjustments will be comparable to those received in project development mine mine at mccoy elkhorn began producing coal in september two crews of miners and equipment have been working separately at the base of the slope and shaft completing bottom development work 
due to the year expected life of this mine  this development work has been more expensive and more time consuming than normal mining operations 
the bottom development work has been completed and the two crews of miners have joined together to begin advance mining 
the second section of miners and equipment are expected to begin production during the second quarter of surface mines and highwall miner our strategic plan is to achieve balance between mining methods underground and surface and coal basins capp and illinois basin 
the company believes that these strategies will result in greater stability and visibility in operating and financial performance 
as part of executing this plan  the company is developing capp surface mine reserves that we primarily control 
our operations and engineering teams have identified more than projects that merit further review 
approximately six projects have been identified for short and medium term development  including the following our first company operated surface mine in the capp region opened in september the second surface mining project that we are developing in the capp region is a highwall miner project at the leeco mine complex 
this mine is expected to begin production during the second quarter of we are currently conducting site preparation activities 
we anticipate that the third company operated surface mine in the capp region will begin production during the fourth quarter of preparation plant upgrade projects the bevins branch plant at the mccoy elkhorn mine complex is being upgraded and expanded to accommodate extra production from mine mine is directly across the street from the bevins branch plant 
all coal from mine and the adjacent mine will be transported by beltline directly into the preparation plant 
the upgrade and modification project is expected to significantly decrease our trucking costs at this mine complex 
the newly expanded bevins branch plant is expected to begin processing coal in early march the leatherwood plant at the blue diamond mine complex will replace older and less efficient coal processing technology with new heavy media cyclones 
this project is expected to increase the output of clean coal from the plant by to 
the efficiency project is expected to be completed in april indiana land and mineral company definitive agreement we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire coal reserves and rail loadout facilities in southern indiana from indiana land and mineral company  llc il m for approximately million in cash 
the il m transaction has been approved by the company s board of directors and by the board of directors and members of il m 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including the company obtaining financing for the acquisition on terms and conditions approved by its board of directors 
the company will also explore completing this acquisition through a sale leaseback transaction with one its existing land company relationships 
the assets covered by the definitive agreement include million tons of underground reserves located primarily in pike and warrick counties  indiana  tons of surface reserves located in pike county  indiana 
a rail loadout facility located in pike county  indiana 
strategic alternative investigation we have engaged morgan stanley co  as financial advisor to assist in exploring various strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
we are considering a wide range of options  which may include a possible sale of the company 
we have authorized morgan stanley to contact and provide information to prospective strategic and financial purchasers 
no assurance can be given that any transaction will be pursued  or if a transaction is pursued  that it will be consummated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our million senior notes have a fixed interest rate and are not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
the revolver component of our senior secured credit facility has floating interest rates based on our leverage ratio the applicable rate plus the company s option of either i the greater of a the prime rate or b the federal funds open rate plus or ii a euro rate as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the term component of the senior secured credit facility 
we do not expect to use interest rate swaps to manage this risk 
a basis point increase in the average interest rate for our floating rate borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million for each million of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility 
we manage our commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which we define as contracts with a term of one year or more  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we believe that the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts was approximately for the year ended december  all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we are not engaged in any foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions and we have no trading market risk
