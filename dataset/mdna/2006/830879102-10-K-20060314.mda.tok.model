item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of the end of december  and you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report or incorporated herein by reference 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the sections of this report entitled cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and item a

overview through skywest airlines and asa  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and asa offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with more than  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
additionally  we provide ground handling services for approximately ten other airlines throughout our system 
as of december   our consolidated fleet consisted of crjs assigned to united and assigned to delta  including ten crjs which have been upgraded to conform to the manufacturer s specifications for crjs crjs assigned to united and assigned to delta  brasilia turboprops assigned to united and assigned to delta  and atr turboprops all assigned to delta 
we believes our success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with major airline partners is attributable to our delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet at a competitive cost structure 
for the month ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated under the delta code and approximately was operated under the united code 
skywest airlines has been a partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest airlines expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest airlines expanded its operations to serve as the delta connection in dallas fort worth 
however  effective january   skywest airlines re deployed all its delta connection flights to salt lake city as a result of delta s decision to de hub its dallas fort worth operations 
in  skywest airlines expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city  and a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest  operating more than  total daily flights 
in april  skywest airlines signed an agreement with continental to supply continental with regional airline feed into continental s houston hub beginning on july  the continental flying represented only approximately of our available seat miles or asms during  and generated less than of our operating income 
in january  we announced the mutual decision with continental to end skywest airlines operations as a continental connection carrier and we completed the phase out process on july  on september   we completed the acquisition of asa from delta for million in cash 
additionally  as part of the purchase  we paid million of transaction fees and asa assumed approximately billion in long term debt 
in addition  we returned to delta million in deposits that delta had previously paid on future asa aircraft deliveries 
we believe the combination of skywest airlines and asa presents our company with new opportunities for growth through our two geographically focused regional airline platforms skywest airlines in the western united states and asa in the eastern united states 
we now provide the vast majority of regional airline service for delta in atlanta  its most important eastern hub  and salt lake city  its most important western hub 
in connection with the asa acquisition  we have established new  separate  but substantially similar  long term fixed fee delta connection agreements with delta for both skywest airlines and asa 
we also obtained control of gates in the hartsfield jackson international airport located in atlanta  from which we currently provide service to delta 
delta has committed to provide to us opportunities to utilize additional regional jets in our fleet by the end of delta has also agreed that  starting in  asa is guaranteed to maintain its percentage of total delta connection flights that it has in  so long as its bid for additional regional flying is competitive with other regional carriers 
asa has been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since asa expanded its operations as a delta connection carrier to also include cincinnati northern kentucky and salt lake city in september and april  respectively 
asa operates approximately daily flights  all in the delta connection system 
historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of our controlled or pro rate flying and contract flying 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
since august   substantially all of our flights have been contract flights 
for the year ended december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining nine percent flown under pro rate arrangements 
in september  delta filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
prior to the date of delta s bankruptcy filing  each of skywest airlines and asa entered into an amended delta connection agreement which provides for a year term  subject to certain termination and extension rights 
delta received all necessary approvals from the us bankruptcy court and the delta connection agreements were assumed by delta on october  under the terms of its delta connection agreement  skywest airlines is compensated primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis  is reimbursed for fuel and other direct costs  and is paid a margin based on completed block hours 
under its delta connection agreement  asa is compensated primarily on a fee per completed block hour basis  is directly reimbursed for fuel and other costs  and is paid a margin based on performance incentives 
notwithstanding the assumption by delta of the delta connection agreements  delta s bankruptcy filing could still lead to many other unforeseen expenses  risks and uncertainties for skywest airlines  asa or both 
although delta has reported that it intends to reorganize and emerge from its ongoing chapter bankruptcy proceeding  it could convert its reorganization proceeding to a liquidation proceeding under the us bankruptcy code or liquidate some or all of its assets through one or more transactions with third parties 
such events could jeopardize our delta connection operations  leave us unable to efficiently utilize the additional aircraft which we are currently obligated to purchase  or result in other outcomes which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
although a plan of reorganization has been confirmed in united s bankruptcy proceedings  which became effective on february  subject to pending appeals  there is no assurance that united s plan will ultimately succeed 
among other uncertainties  united s order of confirmation is subject to pending appeals 
there is no assurance that united will be able to operate successfully under the terms of its plan 
in the event united is not able to perform successfully under the terms of its plan  our united express operations could be jeopardized  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
on february   we announced that skywest had been selected by united to operate new crjs in its united express operations  and that skywest had placed a firm order for these crjs with bombardier 
deliveries of these aircraft began in the third quarter of and we expect these deliveries to be completed by the first quarter of our total firm aircraft orders and commitments  as of december   consisted of orders for crjs  crjs and commitments to lease six crj s from delta 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations is estimated to be approximately million through april additionally  our agreement with bombardier includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
we presently anticipate that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in january and continue through april  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by us and our code share partners 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases and impairment of long lived assets and intangibles as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
in the event that our contractual rates have not been finalized at quarterly or annual financial statement dates  we record revenues based on a prior period s approved rates  adjusted to reflect management s current estimate of the results of the then current contract negotiations 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreements  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed  thus substantially reducing significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the engine 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs 
under the terms of the agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while asa s aircraft are primarily debt financed on a long term basis 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of asa 
the intangiblel is being amortized over fifteen years under the strait line method 
as of december   we had recorded  in amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether the book value of our aircraft is impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
results of operations compared to operating statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the percentage of change for the years identified below 
year ended december  change passengers carried revenue passenger miles available seat miles passenger load factor pts passenger breakeven load factor pts yield per revenue passenger mile revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles our total asms generated during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  the increase in asms was primarily a result of increasing the size of our aircraft fleet  including our acquisition of asa  from aircraft as of december   to aircraft as of december  on the date we acquired asa  asa s fleet consisted of aircraft crjs  crjs and atrs 
in addition to the aircraft acquired in connection with the acquisition of asa  we took delivery of crj s and two crjs during the year ended december  net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below 
operating revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of asa 
airline operating and interest expenses  excluding fuel charges  per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the increased capacity of our regional jet aircraft and the increase in stage lengths flown by our regional jet aircraft 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to billion for the year ended december   from billion  or of consolidated operating revenues  for the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel reimbursements from major partners  increased for the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel was primarily due to a increase in asms  principally as a result of our increase in operating aircraft to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december  revenue per asm increased to  from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in fuel reimbursements from our major partners 
passenger revenues include an amount designed to reimburse us for aircraft ownership costs 
the amount deemed to be rental income for the year ended was million 
passenger load factor 
passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of our relationships with united and delta whereby skywest supplements mainline service in previously established and developed markets 
additionally  we are experiencing higher passenger acceptance of our regional jet aircraft 
ground handling and other revenue 
total ground handling revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily related to contracts with our major partners  whereby  skywest performs the ground handling for other regional airlines 
total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are substantially reimbursable by our major partners  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the acquisition of asa 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased at a lower rate than asm growth  primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by the regional jets 
operating and interest expenses 
operating and interest expenses increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in total operating and interest expenses was due principally to the acquisition of asa 
as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating and interest expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in operating and interest expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to significant increases in fuel costs year over year 
the following tables set forth information regarding our operating expense components for the years ended december  and operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
individual expense components are also expressed as cents per asm 
year ended december  amount percentage of revenue cents per asm amount percentage of revenue cents per asm in thousands in thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits aircraft costs maintenance fuel other airline expenses interest total airline expenses the cost per asm of salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in number of employees was due  in large part  to the acquisition of asa and addition of personnel required for the new regional jet flying and ground handling operations within our united express operations 
the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of asa s regional jet fleet and the addition of thirty crjs  which have a lower operating cost per asm than our existing crj and turboprop fleets 
the cost per asm for maintenance expense remained constant at for the year ended december   and december  under our united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on regional jet engines that we record as revenue 
however  consistent with the change to a direct expense maintenance policy  we record maintenance expense on our crj engines as it is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december   we collected and recorded as revenue million pretax under the united express agreement  with no material offset to crj engine maintenance overhauls 
because the maintenance line in the table set forth above does not include salaries  wages and employee benefits associated with our maintenance operations those costs are stated separately in the table  the maintenance expense line in the above table differs from the maintenance line in our condensed consolidated statements of income set forth in item below 
the cost per asm for fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the average price of fuel increasing to per gallon during the year ended december   from per gallon for the year ended december  the cost per asm for other expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to the increase in stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the acquisition of asa s aircraft which are primarily financed with long term debt 
compared to operating statistics

net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues include an amount designed to reimburse us for aircraft ownership cost 
the amount deemed to be rental income for the year ended was million 
passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to billion for the year ended december   from million  or of consolidated operating revenues  for the year ended december  passenger revenues  excluding fuel reimbursements from major partners  increased for the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel was primarily due to a increase in asms  principally as a result of us increasing our operating aircraft to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december   however  this increase was partially offset by the economic efficiencies of flying new  incremental regional jet aircraft 
these efficiencies are passed on to our major partners through the rates contemplated by their respective contracts 
twelve crjs and twelve additional crjs were placed into service under our united express operations during the year ended december  revenue per asm increased to  from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in fuel reimbursements from major partners 
passenger load factor 
passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of our relationships with united and delta whereby skywest supplements mainline service in previously established and developed markets

total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are substantially reimbursable by our major partners  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the expansion of skywest s regional jet fleet from 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased at a lower rate than asm growth  primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by the regional jets 
operating and interest expenses 
operating and interest expenses increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total operating and interest expenses was due principally to the growth in our regional jet fleet from as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating and interest expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in operating and interest expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to significant increases in fuel costs year over year 
operating revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   while total operating and interest expenses increased over the same period 
the increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to the growth in skywest s regional jet fleet from airline operating and interest expenses  excluding fuel charges  per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the increased capacity of our regional jet aircraft and the increase in stage lengths flown by our regional jet aircraft

the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of twelve crjs  which have a lower operating cost per asm than our existing aircraft 
additionally  the decrease was due  in part  to our changing the estimate on depreciable lives of rotable spares from five years to ten years effective january this change in estimate increased our pretax income by  for the year ended december  the impact of this change on costs per asm for the year ended december  was and the remaining decrease was primarily due to the increase in the number of regional jets that were added to our fleet during the cost per asm for maintenance expense increased to for the year ended december   from the year ended december  the increase in cost per asm was primarily due to the timing of certain maintenance events 
under our united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on regional jet engines that we record as revenue 
however  consistent with the change to a direct expense maintenance policy  we record maintenance expense on our crj engines as it is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december  we collected and recorded as revenue million pretax under the united express agreement  with no corresponding offset for crj engine maintenance overhauls since none were incurred 
because the maintenance line in the table set forth above does not include salaries  wages and employee benefits associated with our maintenance operations those costs are stated separately in the table  the maintenance expense line in the above table differs from the maintenance line in our condensed consolidated statements of income set forth in item below 
the cost per asm for fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the average price of fuel increasing to per gallon during the year ended december   from per gallon for the year ended december  the cost per asm for other expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to our elimination of certain reservation and distribution costs which were previously associated with the united express agreement that are now handled directly by united  along with the increase in stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the long debt financing of the new regional jets we acquired 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the decrease was principally caused by the use of cash to fund the acquisition of asa 
the principal sources of cash during the year ended december  were million in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities  million provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  million of proceeds from draws under new and existing lines of credit  million from returns on aircraft deposits  million from proceeds from the sale of leased aircraft  and million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  million sale of other assets and million of proceeds from the sale of owned aircraft 
during the year ended december   we paid net of cash acquired from asa million as the purchase price for asa 
we invested million in flight equipment  million in deposits for aircraft  and million in buildings and ground equipment 
we made principal payments on long term debt of million and paid million in cash dividends 
these factors resulted in a million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  our position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in marketable securities was due primarily to the million in purchase price  million in transaction fees and million in returns of aircraft deposits we paid to delta in connection with our acquisition of asa on september  at december   our total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  the change in the total capital mix during was primarily due to our acquisition of asa on september  during  skywest increased an existing million line of credit facility  with a bank  to million 
as of december   skywest airlines had borrowed million under the facility 
the facility  expires on january  and bears interest at a rate equal to prime less  which was a net rate of on december  additionally  skywest airlines entered into another borrowing facility with a financing company and borrowed million 
the facility expires on march   with interest payable on a floating basis which was at december  the borrowings under this facility are secured by four crjs 
the amounts borrowed under both arrangements were utilized for general corporate purposes and we intend to pay this back from cash generated through operations 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
on december   we classified million as restricted cash  related to our workers compensation policies and the purchase of asa 
on december   we classified million as restricted cash as required by our workers compensation policy 
significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations stated in calendar years except as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations principal maturities on long term debt lines of credit total commitments and obligations purchase commitments and options on february   we announced that skywest airlines had been selected by united to operate new crjs in its united express operations  and that skywest airlines had placed a firm order for these crjs with bombardier 
deliveries of these aircraft began in the third quarter of and we expect these deliveries to be completed by the first quarter of our total firm aircraft orders and commitments as of december   consisted of orders for crjs  crjs and commitments to lease six crj s from delta 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations is estimated to be approximately million 
additionally  our agreement with bombardier includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
we presently anticipate that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in may and continue through april  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by us and our code share partners 
skywest airlines has not historically funded a substantial portion of its aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  it has generally funded its aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available  and selected one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing can not be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardia has financed aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to satisfy our firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as our acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for the committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  as part of our leveraged lease agreements  we typically agree to indemnify the equity owner participant against liabilities that may arise due to changes in benefits from tax ownership of the respective leased aircraft 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
long term debt obligations our total long term debt at december  was  million  of which  million related to the acquisition of brasilia turboprop  crj and crj aircraft and million related to our corporate office building 
the average effective rate on the debt related to the brasilia turboprop and crj aircraft was approximately at december  approximately  million of our current portion of long term debt is expected to be refinanced into permanent long term financing within the next year 
seasonality our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions 
our operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased travel on our pro rate routes  historically occurring in the summer months  and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from november through january and by inclement weather which occasionally results in cancelled flights  principally during the winter months 
new accounting standard as contemplated by sfas statement  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using intrinsic value method set forth in apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we have determined that we will adopt sfas using the modified prospective method 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment statement r  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
we will be required to adopt statement r effective january  the adoption of the fair value method set forth in statement r is likely to have a significant impact on our future results of operations  although it is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future primarily because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united will bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our united express flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta will bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
on the majority of our delta connection routes flown using brasilia turboprops  we will bear the economic risk of fuel fluctuations 
at present  we believe that our results from operations will not be materially and adversely affected by fuel price volatility 
interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  and we would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through the manufacturer  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements with delta and united  our code share agreements currently provide that reimbursement rates will be adjusted higher or lower to reflect any changes in our aircraft rental rates 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure on the debt instrument related to the company s headquarters
