paperboard packaging industry overview the paperboard packaging industry manufactures and sells corrugated products  folding cartons and rigid fiber boxes 
our paperboard packaging segment competes primarily in the folding carton segment of the industry 
folding carton packaging is used to package various consumer products such as pharmaceuticals  personal care products  cosmetics  tobacco products  confectioneries  alcoholic drinks  and food products 
folding cartons do not include corrugated brown boxes  which are typically used for shipping and transportation of products in bulk 
folding cartons generally serve the dual purpose of protecting non durable goods during shipping and distribution  and attracting consumer attention to the product at retail 
as printing technologies have continued to improve  the marketing function of folding cartons has become increasingly important as consumer products companies rely more heavily on the retail promotional value of product packaging 
folding cartons are made from several grades of paperboard  including folding boxboard 
the paperboard used in folding cartons must meet specific quality and technical standards for bending  creasing  scoring and folding without breaking or cracking  stiffness and resistance to bulging  ink absorption  and surface smoothness for printing  embossing or laminating 
historically  folding boxboard has been one of the paperboard grades used most frequently by the folding carton industry  because of its superior strength and appearance and because it provides one of the best surfaces for high quality printing 
the paperboard used in folding cartons is typically die cut  printed and shipped flat from folding carton plants to manufacturer customers  where the cartons are then erected and filled on production lines 
vertical integration is less common in the european folding carton industry than in other paper based packaging markets  such as corrugated containers 
in part  this reflects the lower volume  higher value added nature of the folding carton business  but also the need of most folding carton producers to utilize various grades of paperboard 
as a result  many of the largest folding carton companies in europe do not manufacture the paperboard they use as raw materials 
our folding carton operations are located primarily in europe 
the european folding carton industry is a market composed of several types of suppliers pan european companies serving global customers  regional firms addressing select products at the country level  and local businesses specializing in niche product categories 
none of the major european packaging suppliers commands a dominant pan european market position  although certain competitors may dominate particular geographic areas or market niches 
the european folding carton market is fragmented and highly competitive 
suppliers generally differentiate their products and services based on design capabilities  print quality and  increasingly  the ability to service pan european requirements 
the end use markets served by most folding carton suppliers vary widely in terms of technical requirements  product pricing and  to a lesser extent  growth rates 
operations our paperboard packaging segment consists primarily of operations acquired as part of our strategic transformation in and these operations have been consolidated for accounting purposes since their respective acquisition dates 

table of contents we have consolidated the sales  marketing and administrative functions of these businesses  which has resulted in reduced overhead  purchasing synergies and a more effective sales and marketing effort 
we continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity in light of our customers demands and growth strategies and continue to rationalize manufacturing facilities in this segment by closing redundant or underutilized facilities

these products are distributed by our customers primarily to european retail markets  and more recently in the united states 
tobacco products 
we are one of europe s leading suppliers of paperboard packaging for the tobacco industry  including offset and gravure cartons  carton outers  printed paper and film  and inner frame board 
our customers  including british american tobacco plc  gallaher limited  a subsidiary of gallaher group plc  and altadis  sa  use our packaging for brands that are manufactured in europe for sale locally and to global export markets 
our competitive strengths for tobacco packaging include our skill in electronic manipulation of graphic 
table of contents elements using computer aided design equipment  which facilitates the insertion of required government health warnings within the pack design  and in line high speed gravure printing  embossing and gold leaf processes 
brands which use our packaging include state express  benson hedges and silk cut 
product packaging has become one of the leading promotional vehicles for tobacco products because of stringent limitations on other forms of marketing tobacco products in many countries 
product design  manufacturing and distribution our paperboard packaging segment generally manufactures packaging from specifications  artwork or film supplied by customers 
however  we also design  develop and manufacture new packaging concepts and structures when requested by customers 
many of the cartons we manufacture incorporate sophisticated construction techniques and include high graphic content  and special finishes and effects 
we believe our commitment to technological leadership in structural and graphic design and its integration with manufacturing processes is a significant competitive strength 
we work closely with customers to develop new packaging and to refine existing packaging designs 
this involves working with external design agencies employed by customers and using our in house technical and design capabilities 
our packaging design centers also are used by our customers to develop and test innovative packaging designs and graphics 
elements of the design are usually retained on computer and updated as required  enabling design work to be undertaken at the factory and subsequently reviewed at the customer s location 
we have also established an electronic network for design data interchange between our factories and with certain customers 
the availability of sophisticated in house design services enhances our high quality image and improves our response time to customer requests  particularly for new product launches 
our manufacturing facilities are equipped with multi color sheet and or web fed printing presses which  depending on the needs of the specific plant  may include gravure  lithographic  flexographic and digital printing 
in addition  we utilize digital pre press processes  including direct to plate graphic work  which eliminates the need for film in the printing process 
this facilitates the transmission of graphics throughout all of our locations to better serve our multinational customers 
other equipment includes plate making equipment  gold blocking machines  diecutters embossers  folders and gluers 
the principal elements of the production process  following design  are plate making computer aided design systems directly produce metal print plates for lithographic printing and produce digital files for engraving of gravure cylinders 
die making a computer generated carton profile guides lasers which cut slots in wooden forms 
metal strips are then inserted in the grooves as required  which cut and crease the cartons 
printing we use three primary printing techniques lithographic  in line flexographic and gravure 
lithographic printing on sheet fed paperboard is used for most printing requirements  except for high volume runs or where certain specialty finishes or deep solid colors are required 
gravure printing is used to produce high quality cartons which require exact print register  solid color saturation  fine line work and embossing 
gravure printing takes place predominantly on reel fed machines capable of handling high volumes 
in line flexographic printing with ultraviolet drying offers a cheaper processing alternative to gravure  particularly for specialty finishes and solid colors 
we utilize smaller format printing machinery to complement larger format presses  which enables us to undertake shorter production runs in a cost effective manner 
cutting and creasing printed sheets are fed through cut and crease machines where dies are used to cut and crease the paperboard to form a carton 
gluing and packing the production process culminates  if necessary  with the application of glue to  and the folding of  cartons  and the delivery of the finished cartons to our customers 
many customers receive cartons unfolded and unglued  and use their own in house machinery  sometimes on lines designed and supplied by us  to apply glue to and fold the cartons  while others use their machinery to erect and fill pre folded  pre glued cartons 
some customers require cartons to be delivered fully assembled  an operation which is performed manually 

table of contents cartons generally are produced only to order and delivered on an agreed schedule 
delivery to customers usually takes place immediately following completion of the production process 
as a result  order backlog is not substantial 
meeting customers increasingly complex requirements and technical specifications requires a strong commitment to quality and attention to detail 
we use statistical process control techniques to identify key areas for improvement including the reduction of waste and down time 
we believe we are a leader in european manufacturing practices and working disciplines 
our plants conform to standards specific to their country and market sectors  such as ps  good manufacturing practices and royal society of food hygiene accreditation 
a majority of our pharmaceutical packaging facilities operate to iso series quality standards 
sales and marketing our paperboard packaging segment s sales result primarily from direct solicitation of existing and prospective customers 
local management and sales personnel at each manufacturing facility are responsible for sales and customer relationships and  where appropriate  are supported by head office sales and marketing initiatives 
our marketing and sales efforts emphasize our ability to print high quality specialized packaging in a timely manner by utilizing advanced manufacturing systems 
our packaging design staff is frequently consulted by customers for assistance in developing new and alternative packaging concepts 
we also assist our customers in the development and acquisition of automated packaging equipment for their manufacturing facilities  which can use our packaging products 
we actively support our sales effort by researching market trends as well as by developing promotional materials that highlight our capabilities within specific end use markets 
our ability to meet the rapid delivery requirements and variable demand patterns of our customers has enhanced our competitive position with multinational branded products companies 
we have longstanding trading relationships with many of our larger paperboard packaging customers but  as is typical in our industry  we generally do not enter into long term fixed quantity supply agreements 
instead  we have agreements or letters of intent in place with many of our larger customers  with terms of up to five years  that specify the terms of trade and service requirements for the period of the arrangement  some of which award sole or majority supply for specific classes of packaging products for the customer  but only to the extent the customer requires such products 
these supply arrangements are generally awarded by the larger packaging customers through a tender process in which the customer solicits bids from several potential suppliers and selects the winning bid based on several factors  including price and service 
typically  major packaging customers centralize their purchasing on a global or pan european basis and seek to obtain their packaging requirements from a limited number of sources to maximize their efficiency 
we regularly submit bids for new business or renewal of existing business 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in our paperboard packaging segment  such as paperboard  paper  inks  foil  films and adhesives 
the primary raw material for our paperboard packaging segment is paperboard  which is converted to make the walls of the packaging unit 
the primary paperboard grade we use is virgin folding boxboard 
most of our raw materials are readily available from various suppliers at competitive market prices 
raw material prices are generally negotiated centrally  but individual factories can enter into further negotiations and sometimes achieve better prices on specific contracts 
this strategy is designed to strengthen our overall purchasing power  while enabling each factory to retain a sufficient degree of autonomy in its purchasing decisions to take advantage of better spot pricing offered by suppliers 
we endeavor to have our customer contracts include provisions for passing through increased raw materials costs by associating pricing increases with a raw materials index 

table of contents plastic packaging industry overview the plastic packaging industry manufactures and sells plastic bottles  preforms  containers  closures  films and sheets 
we compete in the plastic bottles  preforms  containers and closures segment of the industry 
plastic bottles  containers and closures are used to store  transport  preserve and dispense a wide variety of food  beverage and other consumer and industrial products 
manufacturers consider a number of variables in evaluating whether plastic containers should be used for a particular packaging application 
these include cost  compatibility with the intended contents  shelf life  flexibility of size  handling characteristics  filling and closing speeds  processing reactions  impermeability  dent and tamper resistance and consumer preferences 
plastic s penetration of traditional glass  paperboard and metal packaging applications is driven by its advantages  such as clarity  weight  strength  shatter resistance  barrier properties and ease of opening and dispensing 
nondurable goods industries consume the majority of plastic packaging products  with beverages and food being the largest markets 
other important packaging markets include pharmaceutical and healthcare products  personal care items and chemical products 
factors which influence plastic packaging demand include consumer spending  population growth  technological advancements in packaging materials  environmental and regulatory concerns  international trade patterns and packaging product development

in recent years  we have developed process capabilities to offer our pet customers lighter weight bottles  improved barrier performance and faster preform reheating resulting in lower energy consumption during the blowing process 
pet conversion from raw plastic resin is carried out in our plants in northern ireland  south africa  france and mauritius 
pet is injection molded to create preforms that are subsequently blow molded into bottles  either in our manufacturing facilities or at our customers plants 
pet granules are heated and then forced into a mold that forms the preform to the required shape 
preforms are then stored before being converted to bottles 
conversion of the preforms into bottles takes place at our plants in northern ireland  south africa  france and china 
preforms are loaded into the blow molding machine and heated individually using infrared lamps 
precise control of these lamps enables the wall thickness in the bottle to be accurately controlled 
heated preforms are placed into a blow mold  and simultaneously blown with high pressure air and stretched with a mechanical rod to create the desired bottle 

table of contents for specialty chemicals and agrochemicals that include aggressive constituents  we manufacture hdpe bottles and containers using fluorinated blow molding to enhance the barrier characteristics of the container wall 
hdpe is also used for closures which are supplied to many of our preform and bottle customers in the soft drink industry in the united kingdom and ireland 
extrusion blow molding of hdpe containers takes place at our plants in the united kingdom  france  ireland and china  with fluorinated barrier containers produced at all these locations except ireland 
raw hdpe granules are heated and extruded 
for fluorinated containers  each extrusion is then blown into the mold with a fluorine and nitrogen gas mixture 
for conventional containers  the extrusions are blown into the mold with air 
containers are then leak tested before delivery to customers 
hdpe closures are produced in our plants in northern ireland and china using injection molding machines 
single piece closures are produced at our plant in ireland for the soft drink industry  and two piece closures are produced at our plant in china for the agrochemicals industry 
plastic containers generally are produced only to order and delivered pursuant to an agreed schedule 
delivery to customers usually takes place immediately following completion of the production process 
as a result  order backlog is not substantial 
sales and marketing our plastic packaging segment s sales result primarily from direct customer contacts by plant managing directors and a dedicated sales force 
our marketing and sales efforts emphasize our ability to react quickly to changing customer demand patterns and to supply products manufactured to the highest industry standards of quality and performance 
our design and packaging development staff work closely with customers to improve product performance and reduce product costs 
this includes reductions in product weight while maintaining agreed performance criteria 
we actively support our sales effort with market research to identify potential opportunities and market trends across our businesses  as well as developing promotional materials that highlight our capabilities within specific end use markets 
we have longstanding trading relationships with many of our larger plastic packaging customers but  as is typical in this industry  we generally do not enter into long term fixed quantity supply agreements 
instead  we have agreements or letters of intent in place with many of our larger customers  with terms of up to five years  that specify the terms of trade and service requirements for the period of the arrangement  some of which award sole or majority supply for specific classes of packaging products for the customer  but only to the extent the customer requires such products 
these supply arrangements are generally awarded by the larger packaging customers through a tender process in which the customer solicits bids from several potential suppliers and selects the winning bid based on several factors  including price and service 
we regularly submit bids for new business or renewal of existing business 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in our plastic packaging segment  including raw pet and hdpe plastic resins 
raw materials for our plastic packaging segment are readily available from various suppliers at competitive market prices 
we believe that we maintain a supply chain that is adequate to meet our inventory demands  but there is no assurance that this will be true in the future 
our gross profit may be affected by fluctuations in resin prices 
however  negotiations with customers can generally permit changes in resin prices to be passed through to most of our customers through appropriate changes in product pricing 
we endeavor to have our customer contracts include provisions for passing through increased raw materials costs by associating pricing increases with a raw materials index 

table of contents competition competition is intense in the markets served by our paperboard packaging and plastic packaging segments  both from large companies and from local and regional producers 
we compete by differentiating ourselves through product design  process capabilities  operational competence and exceptional customer service 
see competitive strengths 
major paperboard packaging competitors include akerlund rausing  algroup  amcor limited  mayr melnhof packaging uk limited  a subsidiary of mayr melnhof karton ag  my holdings  a subsidiary of nampak ltd  van genechten packaging  cardinal health  inc  and meadwestvaco corporation 
in addition  in response to customer demand for pan european sources of supply in pharmaceutical and healthcare markets  some smaller producers have also entered into pan european trading alliances 
examples of such alliances include copapharm europe an alliance of british  german  spanish  french  italian and swiss carton manufacturers which supplies folding cartons to the european pharmaceutical industry and pharmapact an alliance of british  german  french and italian multi product manufacturers which supplies folding cartons  microflute corrugated board  labels  leaflets and specialized systems to the european pharmaceutical industry 
major plastic packaging competitors include constar international  inc  huhtamaki van leer  nampak ltd  esterform  rpc group plc  schmalbach lubeca  a subsidiary of amcor limited  and paradigm packaging 
customers we have many customers that buy our products  and we are not dependent on any single customer  or group of customers  in any of our business segments 
no single customer represents more than of our total net sales 
longstanding relationships exist with many customers who place orders on a continuing basis  and we regularly submit bids to customers for new business or renewal of existing business 
the loss of business or the award of new business from our larger customers may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
because of the nature of our businesses  order backlogs are not large 
employees at january   we had  employees 
some of our employees are represented by various trade unions or workers councils in each of the countries in which we operate 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
seasonality our paperboard packaging segment competes in several end use markets  such as alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances  that are seasonal in nature 
as a result  our paperboard packaging segment earnings stream is seasonal  with peak operational activity during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
our plastic packaging segment s markets include beverage and agrochemical markets in the southern hemisphere that are seasonal in nature 
as a result  our plastic packaging segment earnings stream is also seasonal  with peak operational activity during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
research and development we conduct continuing technical research and development projects relating to new products and improvements of existing products and processes 
expenditures for research and development activities are not material 
trademarks and intellectual property we believe that our success depends  in part  on maintaining and enhancing our proprietary technical expertise and know how 
as a standard practice  we obtain legal protections we believe are appropriate for our intellectual property  but legally protected intellectual property rights are not material for our business 
we are not aware of any legal proceedings that have been brought against us for infringement of a patent or trademark 

table of contents compliance with environmental regulations the subsidiary that comprised our former tissue segment has been identified by the us federal government and the state of wisconsin as a potentially responsible party with respect to possible natural resource damages and remediation and restoration liability in the fox river and green bay system in wisconsin 
in connection with the disposition of the assets of that subsidiary  we retained liability for  and the third party indemnity rights associated with  discharges of polychlorinatedbiphenyls commonly referred to as pcbs and other hazardous materials in the fox river and green bay system 
we and other potentially responsible parties are currently engaged in the investigation and remediation of this location 
given the many uncertainties associated with the nature and scope of the remediation effort that will ultimately be required  and uncertainties associated with the possible recovery of the cost of such efforts from third parties  we cannot assure you that the ultimate costs related to this site will not have a material adverse affect on our results

item a 
risk factors you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business 
any of the following risks  as well as other risks and uncertainties  could harm our business and financial results and cause the value of our securities to decline 
the risks below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
risks related to our substantial indebtedness and our common stock our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
our substantial leverage could have significant consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
table of contents limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  require us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets  possibly on less than favorable terms  to meet debt payment obligations  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and expose us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because a part of our indebtedness bears variable rates of interest 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and our other indebtedness could adversely affect our business by limiting our operating and strategic flexibility 
our senior credit facility contains restrictive covenants that include limits on our ability to prepay our other indebtedness  limits on liens and limits on mergers and asset sales 
our senior credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by a deterioration in our operating results  as well as by events beyond our control  including economic conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under our senior credit facility and any of our other indebtedness that may be cross defaulted to our senior credit facility 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility or such other indebtedness  the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such indebtedness  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if these lenders accelerate the payment of that indebtedness or foreclose on the collateral  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other debt 
the indentures for our indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes  contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock  purchase or redeem capital stock  make investments or certain other restricted payments  create liens  sell assets  
table of contents issue or sell stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with shareholders or affiliates  and effect a consolidation or merger 
these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions or other corporate opportunities 
we are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends  interest income and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and pay dividends on our common stock 
we are a united states holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries  most of which are located in other countries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and pay dividends on our common stock will therefore be dependent on receipt of dividends  interest income and loans from our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
subject to the restrictions contained in the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  future borrowings by our subsidiaries may contain restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us 
in addition  under applicable law  our subsidiaries may be limited in amounts that they are permitted to pay as dividends to us on their capital stock 
in particular  there are significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non us subsidiaries to remit money to us 
as a result  our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to us 
if they do not  we may not be able to make debt service payments or pay dividends on our common stock 
risks related to our business our business and financial performance may be harmed by future increases in raw material costs 
the primary raw material for our paperboard packaging segment is paperboard  which is converted to make the walls of the packaging unit 
the primary raw materials for our plastic packaging segment are raw pet and hdpe plastic resins  which are converted to form plastic preforms  bottles  containers and closures 
the primary raw materials used in our business are commodities that are subject to cyclical price fluctuations  which could harm our business 
the cyclical nature of paperboard  hdpe and pet pricing presents a potential risk to our profit margins because we may not be able to immediately pass through price increases to our customers 
moreover  an increase in the selling prices for the products we produce  resulting from a pass through of increased raw materials costs  could reduce the volume of units we sell and decrease our revenues 
competition in specialty packaging markets could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
competition is intense in the paperboard and plastic packaging markets that we serve  both from large companies and from local and regional producers and converters 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
this competition from existing paperboard and plastic packaging suppliers could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  we face the threat of increased competition in the future from new entrants from outside the packaging industry  as well as from existing packaging suppliers  because there are limited barriers to entry for supplying paperboard and plastic packaging to many of the end use markets that we serve 
capital costs are low  and there are only moderate intellectual property and technological barriers 
as a result  it can be difficult for us to increase prices because  if we increase prices above a competitive level  customers can change to a new supplier 
our paperboard packaging and plastic packaging segments also face competition from producers of packaging made from other materials that are suitable for packaging 
our paperboard packaging segment faces competition from producers of packaging using metals  foils  glass and plastics  and our plastic packaging segment faces competition from producers of packaging using paperboard  foils  glass and metals 
the prices that we can charge for paperboard and plastic packaging are therefore constrained by the availability of substitutes such as metal and glass packaging 
with increased competition  we may be required to lower prices  which may reduce our margins and profitability 

table of contents our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by the relocation of our customers plants and manufacturing capacity 
packaging plants are typically located in reasonable proximity to customers manufacturing facilities to reduce transportation costs and facilitate on time delivery of the packaging 
our packaging plants are concentrated in western europe  geographically located near the manufacturing facilities of our major customers 
for various reasons  including shifts in market demand and the ability to reduce labor costs  some of our major customers may relocate all or a portion of their manufacturing capacity 
such relocation may adversely affect our ability to competitively supply our customers 
additionally  a reduction in customer demand may create additional competitive pressures from local industry over capacity 
our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by our inability to effectively implement initiatives under our million cost savings program 
in november  we announced plans for a global cost savings program targeting pre tax savings of million on an annual basis 
the program is expected to include the possible closure or consolidation of several facilities and broad based workforce and overhead reductions  as well as cost savings from improvements to operating processes 
the cost of the program is expected to range form million to million on a pre tax basis  with the cash flow impact being less due the sale of related real estate and assets 
full implementation is expected over the next two years 
projected costs and savings associated with the million cost savings program are subject to a variety of risks  including costs to effect initiatives contemplated under the million cost savings program may exceed estimates  initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various works councils  employee representatives or regulators  and such consultations may influence the timing  costs and extent of expected savings  initiatives will also require close coordination with customers with respect to the transfer of existing business to other company locations  and certain business may not ultimately be retained as a result of possible closures or consolidations of facilities  we may lose skilled employees in connection with the initiatives  and projected savings  including proceeds from the sale of related real estate and other assets  contemplated under this program may fall short of estimated targets 
if we are unable to effectively implement the million cost savings program  our revenues  financial position and profitability will be adversely affected 
our business may suffer from risks related to potential future acquisitions 
the operations of our company have substantially changed over the last eight years through the divestiture of our commodity paper products  forest products and corrugated packaging businesses and the acquisition of our existing specialty packaging operations 
substantially all of our existing specialty packaging operations were acquired within the last seven years through a series of acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  over the next few years  we may expand our network of packaging facilities  which is now located primarily in europe  through the acquisition of complementary businesses in north america and we may pursue smaller acquisitions  joint ventures or alliances primarily in europe and emerging markets such as the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be able successfully to integrate any future acquisitions  which could adversely impact our long term competitiveness and profitability 
any future acquisitions will involve a number of risks that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
in particular the integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined 
the combination of the businesses or plants may require  among other things  coordination of administrative and other functions and consolidation of production capacity 
plant consolidation may strain our ability to deliver products of acceptable quality in a timely manner from consolidated facilities 
we may experience attrition among the skilled labor force at the companies acquired in reaction to being acquired and in reaction to our consolidation of plants 
the execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from operating our business 
we may assume known and unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
future acquisitions could cause a reduction of our reported earnings because of the issuance of additional securities or debt  increased interest costs  goodwill write offs and an increased income tax rate 
with respect to our strategic plan to grow in part through acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions at acceptable prices or that we will have access to sufficient capital to take advantage of desirable acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our future acquisitions will have revenues  profits or productivity comparable to those of our past acquisitions 
future acquisitions may require substantial capital 
although we expect to use borrowings under our senior credit facility to pursue these opportunities  we cannot assure you that such borrowings will be available in sufficient amounts or that other financing will be available in amounts and on terms that we deem acceptable 
in addition  our senior credit facility and other indentures governing the senior subordinated notes impose  and our future indebtedness may impose  limitations on our ability to enter into acquisitions  alliances or joint ventures 
our financial performance and the condition of the capital markets will affect the value of our common stock  which could make it a less attractive form of consideration for making acquisitions 
if we cannot identify suitable acquisitions or if we cannot access sufficient capital to take advantage of such acquisitions  we may have to curtail our strategic plan for growth through acquisitions  which could limit our ability to achieve our targeted competitive strategic position and have a material adverse impact on our long term success 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our larger packaging customers  our business may be harmed 
we generally do not enter into long term fixed quantity supply agreements with our main customers 
many of our larger packaging customers are multinational companies that purchase large quantities of packaging materials 
typically  major packaging customers centralize their purchasing on a pan european basis and seek to obtain their packaging requirements from a limited number of sources to achieve maximum efficiency 
many of these 
table of contents companies are sophisticated purchasers with centralized procurement departments 
they generally enter into supply arrangements through a tender process that solicits bids from several potential suppliers and selects the winning bid based on several attributes  including price and service 
generally the supply arrangements usually for terms of one to five years specify the terms of trade and service requirements for the period of the arrangement and some award sole or preferred supply for specific classes of packaging products for the customer  but only to the extent the customer requires such products 
the significant negotiating leverage possessed by many of our customers and potential customers limits our ability to negotiate supply arrangements with favorable terms and creates pricing pressure  reducing margins industry wide 
we regularly submit bids for new business or renewal of existing business 
the loss of one or more of our larger customers  or reduced orders by any of our larger customers  could harm our business and results of operations 
moreover  our customers may vary their order levels significantly from period to period  and customers may not continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods 
because of the nature of our business  order backlogs are not large 
in the event we lose any of our larger customers  we may not be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which could harm our financial results 
our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in the target markets that we serve 
demand for our specialty packaging products in the principal end use markets we serve is primarily driven by consumer consumption of the products sold in the packages we produce  which is often affected by general economic conditions 
the primary end use markets for our paperboard packaging segment are pharmaceutical and healthcare  branded products such as alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances  and food and household products  and tobacco products  while the primary end use markets for our plastic packaging segment are agrochemicals and other specialty chemicals  and food and beverages 
downturns in these sectors could result in decreased demand for our products 
in particular  our business may be adversely affected during periods of economic weakness by the general softness in these consumer markets 
our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken 
these conditions are beyond our ability to control and have had  and may continue to have  a significant impact on our sales and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by seasonal sales cycles 
demand for goods in several of our target end use markets  especially alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances  is typically strongest during the first and fourth fiscal quarters due to the increase in orders placed in preparation for the year end holiday and easter shopping seasons 
demand for our paperboard packaging products from customers in these end use markets is therefore typically strongest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we generally ship a majority of our paperboard packaging products to customers in these end use markets in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
if these customers anticipate soft year end holiday or easter sales  this may result in reduced sales of our paperboard packaging products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for that year 
our borrowing needs are greatest in the first and second fiscal quarters due to reduced seasonal cash flow from our business 
we typically generate nearly all of our cash from operating activities in the second half of our fiscal year  and use cash in operating activities during the first half of the year as a result of our working capital needs 
we conduct the majority of our operations in non us countries  and our operating results are highly dependent on our non us sales and operations  which exposes us to various risks 
we conduct the majority of our operations in non us countries  which exposes us to risks from changes in the political  economic and financial environments in those countries 
sales to customers outside north america accounted for over of our net revenues during each of the last three years 
in addition  one of our strategies for increasing our revenues depends on expansion into additional non us markets 
our non us sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates or imposition of currency exchange controls  difficulties in staffing and managing non us operations  inflexible local labor markets and work rules  costs such as labor  raw materials and equipment costs that fluctuate in the countries in which we do business because such costs are denominated in non us currencies  
table of contents issues relating to uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the protection of intellectual property  changes in trading policies and regulatory requirements  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  language and cultural differences  general political and economic conditions and trends in non us markets  expropriation of assets  including bank accounts  intellectual property and physical assets  by non us governments  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  and longer collection cycles 
accordingly  we may not be able to successfully execute our business plan in non us markets 
if we are unable to achieve anticipated levels of revenues from our non us operations  our revenues and profitability will decline 
we are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that require significant expenditures for compliance and remediation efforts  and changes in the law could increase those expenses and adversely affect our operations 
compliance with the environmental and the health and safety requirements of international  non us and non us federal  state and local governments significantly affects our business 
among other things  these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the water  air and land and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
under certain environmental laws  we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned  operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination 
we have a policy of assessing real property for environmental risks prior to purchase 
we regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws 
we are also required to maintain various environmental permits and licenses  many of which require periodic modification and renewal 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability  including the possible imposition of fines and penalties stemming from non compliance with environmental laws  permits or licenses  is part of the nature of our business 
we cannot assure you that environmental liabilities  including compliance and remediation costs  will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
in addition  future events may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
such future events could include changes in  or new interpretations of  existing laws  regulations or enforcement policies  additional information or facts surfacing with respect to existing investigations or the identification of as yet unknown contamination  further investigation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities  or the adoption of new laws  regulations or permitting requirements 
the subsidiary that comprised our former tissue segment has been identified by the us federal government and the state of wisconsin as a potentially responsible party with respect to possible natural resource damages and remediation and restoration liability in the fox river and green bay system in wisconsin 
in connection with the disposition of the assets of that subsidiary  we retained liability for  and the third party indemnity rights associated with  discharges of polychlorinatedbiphenyls commonly referred to as pcbs and other hazardous materials in the fox river and green bay system 
we and other potentially responsible parties are currently engaged in the investigation and remediation of this location 
given the many uncertainties associated with the nature and scope of the remediation effort that will ultimately be required  and uncertainties associated with the possible recovery of the cost of such efforts from third parties  we cannot assure you that the ultimate costs related to this site will not have a material adverse effect on our results 
see note commitments and contingencies of item  incorporated herein by reference 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of any key personnel may seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled employees involved in the design and manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could harm our business 

table of contents future government regulations and judicial decisions affecting the packaging we produce or the products shipped in the packaging we produce could significantly reduce demand for our packaging products 
government regulations and judicial decisions that affect the packaging we produce or the products shipped in the packaging we produce could significantly reduce demand for our packaging products 
tobacco products have increasingly been subject to litigation and regulation throughout the world 
consumer demand for tobacco products has declined in some countries as a result  and if demand for tobacco products continues to decline and or begins to decline in other countries  our sales of tobacco packaging could be adversely affected 
for example  proposed european union legislation could limit the tar and nicotine levels of tobacco products produced in europe  even if manufactured for export 
future legislation could also limit the use of secondary packaging  such as limiting the sale of bottles of alcoholic drinks in paperboard boxes 
if such legislation becomes law  it could significantly reduce demand for many of our paperboard packaging products and adversely affect our sales 
anti takeover provisions under virginia law and in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws may negatively affect the price of our common stock 
the virginia state corporation act  our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain various provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
among other things  these provisions divide our board of directors into three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms  provide that directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of our common stock which required vote may only be changed by the affirmative vote of a majority of our continuing directors and the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock  require the affirmative vote of holders of at least of our outstanding shares of common stock to approve certain business combinations  and require approval of material acquisition transactions such as mergers  share exchanges  and material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business between our company and any holder of more than percent of any class of our outstanding voting shares by the holders of at least two thirds of the remaining voting shares of our company 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
income tax matters the irs has proposed certain adjustments relating to our tax treatment of our disposition of assets of wisconsin tissue mills inc in we have estimated our maximum potential exposure with respect to the matter to be approximately million  however  we are disputing the proposed adjustment as we continue to believe that our tax treatment of the transaction was correct and that we should prevail in any dispute with the irs related to this matter 
accordingly  no amount has been accrued for this proposed irs adjustment 
we expect to defend the matter vigorously through the irs appeal process and  if necessary  through litigation 
we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatement of our consolidated financial statements  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview of business chesapeake is a leading european supplier of specialty paperboard packaging products and a leading international supplier of plastic packaging products to niche end use markets 
we focus on specific end use packaging markets  where customers demand creative designs  technical expertise and production capabilities that include broad geographic coverage and appropriate supply chain offerings 
chesapeake has two reportable business segments paperboard packaging the paperboard packaging segment designs and manufactures folding cartons  leaflets  labels and other paper packaging products 
our primary end use markets are pharmaceutical and healthcare  branded products such as alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances  and tobacco 
during  we consolidated our view of our end use markets and  as a result  food and household and luxury packaging are now included within the branded products packaging market  which was formerly referred to as international and branded packaging 
references to luxury packaging include the wine  champagne  cosmetics and fragrances packaging portion of the branded products packaging markets

summary of our financial performance for reflects the challenging market conditions in which many of our businesses compete 
we reported a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  for results included a non cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill million after tax  or per share  losses related to divestitures million after tax  or per share  restructuring expenses million after tax  or per share  and the costs related to the early extinguishment of debt million after tax  or per share 
our segment results  discussed under review of segment results reflect the effects of overcapacity and margin pressure in certain of our markets that led  in part  to our initiating the million global cost savings program in late pension costs had a significant adverse impact on our reported results 
since  our annual pension expense has increased by approximately million  and the annual funding of these plans has increased almost to approximately million 
to address those rising costs  we recently took steps to reduce our exposure to long term costs associated with our defined benefit pension plans 
the short term impact on our financial position and results of operations of these steps  however  will be modest 

table of contents in september  we completed the acquisition of impaxx pharmaceutical packaging group  inc  which does business as arlington press 
arlington press is the leading supplier of printed pharmaceutical leaflets in north america 
the transaction strengthens our presence in north america and provides a platform to expand our global pharmaceutical and healthcare packaging business 
we are a leading european supplier of leaflets  labels and cartons to the pharmaceutical market  and arlington press s us pharmaceutical customer base and manufacturing capabilities complement our existing business 
also  in december  we purchased the outstanding minority interest of our south african plastic packaging operations 
this action should provide us with greater flexibility to strengthen our strategic position in this emerging market 
in november  we announced plans for a global cost savings program targeting combined pre tax savings of million on an annual basis 
just as our strategic transformation of the late s redefined who we were the markets in which we compete and our geographical scope of operations we believe that our million cost savings program will redefine chesapeake operationally  building a stronger  more cost effective company  ultimately in a better position to serve our customers in today s global marketplace 
the program  which is discussed more fully herein  is expected to include the possible closure or consolidation of several facilities and broad based workforce and overhead reductions  as well as cost savings from improvements to operating processes 
full implementation is expected over the next two years 
review of consolidated results of operations the following consolidated results from continuing operations highlight major year to year changes in our income statement see page for a discussion of discontinued operations 
more detail regarding these changes is found under the caption review of segment results 
all per share amounts included in this management s discussion and analysis are presented on a diluted basis 
the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and require management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures see discussion of critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our week fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to december fiscal year contains weeks  and fiscal years and contain weeks 
income from continuing operations before interest  extinguishment of debt and taxes is abbreviated as ebit 
segment ebit excludes any goodwill impairment charge  restructuring expenses  asset impairment and other exit costs and gains losses on divestitures 
excluding these amounts from our calculation of segment ebit is consistent with how our management reviews segment performance and  we believe  affords the reader consistent measures of our operating performance 
segment ebit is not  however  intended as an alternative measure of operating results as determined in accordance with gaap 
our definition of segment ebit is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies

net sales chesapeake s net sales of  million were up million  or percent  compared to net sales in of  million 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased net sales by million 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to the plastic packaging segment  resulting from strong volumes across the food and beverage and specialty chemical packaging markets and increased sales prices due to the partial pass through of resin price increases 
within the paperboard packaging segment  weaker demand within certain markets of the branded products packaging division were offset by stronger sales in alcoholic drinks packaging  and increased sales in the pharmaceutical and healthcare packaging market as a result of our acquisition of arlington press in the third quarter of

we conducted our annual impairment test for all reporting units as of december  as a result of competitive economic conditions affecting the paperboard packaging markets and changes in our profile relative to market capitalization and risks associated with the extent and timing of savings anticipated under our million global cost savings program  we recorded an after tax non cash charge of million  or per share  related to impairment of goodwill within the reporting units of the company s paperboard packaging segment 
chesapeake s goodwill balance following the impairment charge is approximately million 
we do not expect the impairment charge to result in future cash expenditures or to affect compliance with covenants under the company s borrowing agreements 
restructuring expenses  asset impairments  and other exits costs in  the company recorded losses of million for restructuring expenses and other exit costs 
these restructuring expenses primarily resulted from the company s efforts to reduce costs  as announced under its million global cost savings program

in july  cpi informed the company of its inability to continue interest payments under the term notes 
also  cpi provided the company with updated financial information that indicated a significant deterioration in the operating results of cpi 
these factors resulted in a change in our estimate as to the recovery of these notes 
due to the subordinated nature of our position as a creditor and the risks associated with pursuing recovery  we wrote down the value of these notes to zero in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company received million from cpi in full settlement for these notes

table of contents chesapeake s million cost savings program during the fourth quarter of  we announced plans for a global cost savings program targeting combined pre tax savings of million on an annualized basis 
while we routinely evaluate our operations for improvement and rationalization opportunities  we believe that the development of this comprehensive program will significantly improve our competitive position and enhance value for our shareholders by focusing on three goals increasing our focus on business operations that are aligned with our global strategic vision and that possess what we believe are the driving forces that will enable us to achieve outstanding performance in the market  improving our operational processes  and reducing our overall company wide cost structure 
the scope of our restructuring program is extensive and could ultimately involve a number of locations being either sold  closed or downsized 
we also expect broad based workforce reductions and a general reduction in overhead costs throughout the company 
additionally  we are targeting specific improvements in operating processes 
the cost of these initiatives is expected to range from million to million on a pre tax basis  with the cash flow impact being less due to the sale of related real estate and assets 
full implementation of this program is expected over the next two years 
we have already begun to implement elements of the cost savings program  as evidenced by our recent announcement of the closure of our food and household paperboard packaging operation in birmingham  england  and the proposed closure of our rigid box luxury paperboard packaging facility in ezy sur eure  france 
discontinued operations our former land development segment owned real estate that we retained when we sold the timberland associated with our former pulp and paper operations 
the real estate was marketed to third parties for residential and commercial development  real estate investment and land conservation 
as of the end of the first quarter of  the remainder of the land development segment was liquidated and  as a result  this segment is now accounted for as a discontinued operation 
discontinued operations in primarily represent the reduction of the liability for contractual obligations related to our former merchandising and specialty packaging segment that was divested in summarized results of discontinued operations are shown separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  except for the consolidated statements of cash flows  which summarize the activity of continued and discontinued operations together 
net sales from discontinued operations were million in and million in seasonality our paperboard packaging segment competes in several end use markets  such as alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances that are seasonal in nature 
as a result  our paperboard packaging segment earnings stream is seasonal  with peak operational activity during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
our plastic packaging segment s markets include beverage and agrochemical markets in the southern hemisphere that are seasonal in nature 
as a result  our plastic packaging segment earnings stream is also seasonal  with peak operational activity during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses chesapeake s liquidity in terms of our overall ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms

guarantees and indemnifications we have entered into agreements for the sale of assets or businesses that contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the sale 
in these sale agreements  we typically agree to indemnify the buyers or other involved third parties against a broadly defined range of potential losses typically including  but not limited to  claims  costs  damages  judgments  liabilities  fines or penalties  and attorneys fees arising from i a breach of our representations or warranties in the sale agreement or ancillary documents  ii our failure to perform any of the covenants or obligations of the sale agreement or ancillary documents  and iii other liabilities expressly retained or assumed by us related to the sale 
most of our indemnity obligations under these sale agreements are i limited to a maximum dollar value significantly less than the final purchase price  ii limited by time within which indemnification claims must be asserted often between one and three years  and iii subject to a deductible or basket 
many of the potential indemnification liabilities under these sale agreements are unknown  remote or highly contingent  and most are unlikely to ever require an indemnity payment 
furthermore  even in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification is subject to determination under the terms of the applicable sale agreement  and any payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of the sale agreements 
however  we accrue for any potentially indemnifiable liability or risk under these sale agreements for which we believe a future payment is probable and a range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
such matters are discussed in note commitments and contingencies of item  incorporated herein by reference 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements for the supply of goods or services to customers that provide warranties to the customer on one or more of the following i the quality of the goods and services supplied by us  ii the performance of the goods supplied by us  and iii our compliance with certain specifications and applicable laws and regulations in supplying the goods and services 
liability under such warranties is often limited to a maximum amount  by the nature of the claim or by the time period within which a claim must be asserted 
as of january   we believe our warranty obligations under such supply agreements were immaterial 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into service agreements with service providers in which we agree to indemnify the service provider against certain losses and liabilities arising from the service provider s performance of the agreement 
generally  such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which the service provider is grossly negligent  engages in willful misconduct or acts in bad faith 
as of january   we believe our liability under such service agreements was immaterial

risk management because we currently conduct a significant amount of our business internationally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets may have a significant impact on our financial statements 
currency fluctuations have much less effect on local operating results  because we mostly sell our products in the same currency used to pay local operating costs 
our currency exposures are cash  debt and foreign currency transactions denominated primarily in the british pound  the euro and the south african rand 
we manage our foreign currency exposures primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and  as such  certain exposures are naturally offset 
the million senior notes issued in december of have been effectively designated as a hedge of our net investment in euro functional currency subsidiaries 
at january   a credit of million related to the revaluation of the debt from euro to us dollars was included as a cumulative translation adjustment 
as part of managing our foreign currency exposures  we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for transactions that are not denominated in the local currency 
the use of these agreements allows us to reduce our overall exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  as the gains and losses on the agreements substantially offset the gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
forward exchange agreements are viewed as risk management tools  involve little complexity and  in accordance with company policy  are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
in  chesapeake entered into a foreign currency forward exchange contract in a notional principal amount of million and having a fair market value liability of million at january  the contract matures in chesapeake is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
from time to time  chesapeake has entered into interest rate swaps to convert variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and vice versa and to obtain an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
amounts currently due to  or from  interest swap counterparties are recorded in interest expense in the period they accrue 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in other accrued liabilities 
at january   there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
at january   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional principal amount of million  and a fair market value liability of approximately million 
in january  chesapeake terminated an interest rate swap and received a cash settlement from the counterparty of million 
of this amount  approximately million will be recognized as an interest rate yield adjustment over the remaining life of the underlying debt 
at january   percent of our debt portfolio consisted of variable rate debt 
a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the interest expense from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed our annual interest expense by million for and million for our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds held by our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from some of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
we examined the potential impact of the american jobs creation act of and determined it did not provide a tax advantage to us 
chesapeake continually evaluates risk retention and insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential exposures to risk 
we devote significant effort to maintaining and improving safety and internal control programs  which are intended to reduce our exposure to certain risks 
management determines the amount of insurance coverage to purchase and the appropriate amount of risk to retain based on the cost and availability of 
table of contents insurance and the likelihood of a loss 
management believes that the current levels of risk retention are consistent with those of comparable companies in the industries in which chesapeake operates 
there can be no assurance that chesapeake will not incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance 
however  our liquidity  financial position and profitability are not expected to be materially affected by the levels of risk retention that we accept 
critical accounting policies we describe the significant accounting policies employed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto within the footnotes 
chesapeake s consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with gaap 
gaap sometimes permits more than one method of accounting to be used 
in addition  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
reported results could have been materially different under a different set of assumptions and estimates 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of chesapeake s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
goodwill and other long lived asset valuations management uses judgment to assess whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
management performs impairment tests that require estimates of factors such as sales volume  pricing  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  asset remaining lives and capital spending 
these projections are necessarily dependent upon assumptions about our performance and the economy in general and could change significantly from period to period 
assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if assumptions and estimates change  it could result in non cash charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  management reviews the recorded value of our goodwill annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  fair value of our reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow model and confirmed using a guideline public companies model  which uses peer group metrics to value a company 
the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is evaluated when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
the fair value is calculated using expected cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  over the remaining life of such assets and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment would be recognized 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for our reporting units as of december  based on our analysis  we concluded that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its estimated fair market value within the reporting units of the paperboard packaging reporting segment 
as a result an after tax non cash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million see note goodwill and intangible assets of item  incorporated herein by reference 
environmental and other contingencies in accordance with gaap  management recognizes a liability for environmental remediation and litigation costs when it believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
due to the wide range of possible outcomes of any environmental obligation  significant management judgment is 
table of contents required to determine the amount of the environmental accrual 
management must make estimates on items such as the remediation and restoration costs based on the estimated contamination levels 
future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted unless the aggregate amount of the obligations  and the amount and timing of the cash payments  are fixed and readily determinable 
the accrual is not reduced for any possible future insurance or indemnification recoveries 
we periodically review the status of all significant existing or potential environmental issues and adjust our accrual as necessary 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed  and increased  our estimate of our reasonably probable environmental costs based on remediation activities to date and other developments 
if any of the estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual outcomes are different than our estimates  we may be required to record material adjustments to the accrual 
see note commitments and contingencies of item  incorporated herein by reference 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits we have significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the actuarial valuations employ key assumptions that are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
payments made by chesapeake related to these benefits will be made over a lengthy period and the projected liability will be affected by assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns and market interest rates  changes in the numbers of plan participants and changes in the benefit obligations and laws and regulations covering the benefit obligation 
during  we took several steps to minimize our exposure to the longer term risks of defined benefit pension arrangements 
specifically  we froze benefits under certain of our us plans and closed our principal uk plan to new entrants 
the uk curtailment cost is not expected to be significant and will be recorded in as the plan closure occurred following the measurement date 
the key assumptions used in developing our fiscal balances are detailed in note employee retirement and postretirement benefits of item  incorporated herein by reference 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of pension expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
pension expense and liabilities would be higher with a higher compensation increase 
management develops assumptions with the assistance of independent actuaries 
discount rates are determined from analyses provided by the actuary of aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under the plans 
if the discount rate used in the valuation were decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at january   and the pension expense would increase by million 
if the discount rate were increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million at january   and the pension expense would decrease by million 
the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses is also a significant element of our net periodic pension expense 
our unrecognized actuarial losses result principally from historical declines in our discount rates as well as the underperformance of plan assets relative to expected returns 
unrecognized actuarial losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service lives of active participants generally years or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans where substantially all participants are inactive 
there were no significant changes to our amortization policies during as a result of permanently freezing benefits available under our principal us defined benefit plans  we expect to change the amortization period for unrecognized actuarial losses for our us plans to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants effective january  to improve the funded status of our pension plans  we increased employer cash contributions by million in over the required contribution  and we anticipate funding to be approximately million above required levels 
we also expect pension expense in to increase by approximately million over levels 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligation abo related to certain of our pension plans exceeded the fair value of those plan assets at january  even taking the additional contributions into account  this deficit was greater than in  and we were required to increase our minimum liability by recording an after tax million adjustment to equity 
market conditions and interest rates significantly impact future assets and liabilities of our pension plans  and could impact funding and charges in the future see note employee retirement and postretirement benefits of item  incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents we annually re evaluate our assumptions used in projecting pension and other postretirement liabilities and associated expense 
had we used different assumptions in calculating the liabilities  the carrying value of the liabilities and the impact on net earnings may have been different 
deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are accrued under gaap 
similarly  certain items of income are not subject to tax when accrued for book purposes 
in addition  certain tax credits and tax loss carryforwards cannot be used until future periods and only if sufficient taxable income is generated 
companies accrue deferred tax assets and liabilities for these temporary differences between income determined under gaap and income determined in accordance with applicable tax law 
when a company has accrued deferred tax assets  gaap requires an assessment based on the judgment of management as to whether  it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in order to realize the benefit of those deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its judgment regarding the likelihood the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  management must consider a variety of factors  including the nature  timing and amount of the expected items of taxable income and expense  current tax statutes with respect to applicable carryforward expiration periods and the company s projected future earnings 
if management determines it is no longer more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be utilized  an offsetting valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce the asset to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to income tax expense in that period 
our accounting for us deferred income taxes is further complicated by our us tax loss position 
our ability to project the recovery of us deferred income tax assets is heavily dependent on the assumptions related to the extent and timing of reversals for taxable temporary differences deferred income tax liabilities 
see note income taxes of item  incorporated herein by reference 
restructuring and other exit costs in connection with our million global cost savings program initiated in  we have accrued liabilities associated with costs of employee terminations and the consolidation of facilities  and have written off assets that will no longer be used in operations 
restructuring related costs have been and will be recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas or sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  as appropriate 
sfas applies to post employment benefits provided to employees under ongoing benefit arrangements  determinable from either the company s postemployment policies or from past practices 
in accordance with sfas  the company records such charges when the termination benefits are probable  capable of estimation  the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
for termination benefits not otherwise provided under ongoing benefit arrangements  sfas requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
the recognition of these charges requires management to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities 
at the end of each reporting period  the company evaluates the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
any change of estimates will be recognized as an adjustment to the accrued liabilities in the period of change 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and it supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized as expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
we currently use the intrinsic value method of accounting for our stock option plans as defined in apb opinion no 
based on this method  no compensation cost has been recognized for our stock options  as the stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we currently provide pro forma disclosures regarding the impact on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation expense  which is based upon a black scholes option pricing model 
sfas r is effective for the first annual period beginning after june  we expect to adopt the new standard as of the beginning of fiscal year using the modified prospective method of transition under which compensation cost for all share based awards granted after the effective date is recognized in accordance with sfas r and compensation cost related to the unvested awards granted prior to the effective 
table of contents date is based on the requirements of sfas similar to the pro forma calculations provided herein 
we do not expect the impact of sfas r to differ materially from the pro forma effects that we have previously disclosed under sfas on march   the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no
