table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality permaclear brand pet polyethylene terephthalate packaging resins  fortrel brand polyester staple fibers  and ecolon engineering resins 
we believe we are the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
at december   we had stated annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of pet resins and billion pounds of polyester staple fiber at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments the packaging products group or ppg and the fibers and recycled products group or frpg 
our permaclear pet resins are produced by the ppg from purified terephtalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg 
these resins are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the frpg produces fortrel polyester staple fiber and other polyester staple fibers that are primarily used in apparel  home furnishing  non woven  and industrial products 
these fibers are produced from pta  meg and recycled raw materials 
in addition  the frpg produces ecolon nylon engineering resins 
north american and global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet  conversions from other packaging materials to pet  and overall growth in beverage and food consumption 
demand for polyester staple fiber is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and textile product imports 
imports of products throughout the textile chain continue to negatively impact the united states and european fiber markets  adversely affecting our operating results 
our financial results are primarily determined by our sales volume and raw material margins  which is the difference between net selling price and raw material cost 
both pet resin and polyester staple fiber volume and raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors  competitive conditions  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on our financial results from changes in raw material margins is significant 
a one cent per pound change in raw material margin on approximately billion pounds of resin and fiber sales volumes results in an annual change of approximately million in pretax earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales to customers are recorded when both title and risk of ownership of the goods transfer to the customer 
provisions for allowances  discounts and rebates to customers are recorded at the time of sale based on our best estimates  which may change 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate amount of allowances  discounts  and rebates 
our estimates could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in adjustments to selling prices 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  especially in light of the difficult economic conditions facing our frpg customers 
these judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts will increase or decrease based on circumstances or specific events impacting customers  including bankruptcy filings and changes in the customers credit ratings 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is recorded based on the purchase price of goods less estimated rebates or credits  and we principally use a first in  first out fifo flow of inventory assumption 
the physical condition ie  quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing the valuation 
our estimates of rebates  credits and the physical condition of the goods are judgments and the actual results could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably 
changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed using the straight line method or the units of production method 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our capital investment strategy  or changes to our business model could result in the actual lives differing from our estimates  in which case our earnings could be affected 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a fixed asset group may not be recoverable  we will test the fixed asset group for impairment 
if any of the impairment indicators are present or if other circumstances indicate that impairment may exist  we then determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the entire facility or site to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate and record the impairment  which is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but we test for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired by this amount 
the estimate of future discounted cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about future operating performance 
our estimates of future discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  our business model  or our operating performance 
deferred tax assets we record deferred tax assets for tax benefits we expect to be recognized in future periods  principally as a result of the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered 
table of contents future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if our businesses do not perform as expected  the valuation allowance may change 
if that occurred  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in an increase or decrease in our tax expense in the period such determination was made 
environmental liability our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different than current accruals  and therefore may have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
pension benefits we have defined benefit plans and defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability asset related to the defined benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  salary and pension increases  mortality tables and discount rates 
we consider the guidance of our professional advisors as well as market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we manage the assets in our defined benefit plans to obtain the highest possible return over the long term commensurate with the appropriate level of assumed risk 
in order to moderate the investment portfolio s volatility  we forecast financial market returns over a wide range of potential future economic trends 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and is reviewed annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments at december and is subject to change each year 
unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized using the corridor method as defined by sfas no 
for our domestic defined benefit plans and the dutch plans 
for the irish plans  we separately identify actuarial gains and losses on the plan s assets and projected benefit obligations and amortize them over a period of five years  subject to the minimum amortization requirements of sfas no 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may be material 
currently  our audit committee of the board of directors is considering a voluntary change in the accounting principle for recognizing net actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations 
if we change our accounting principle  we will be required to restate prior periods financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections

this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we will implement this statement in our first quarter financial statements  however  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  our board of directors voted to vest the  unvested options granted in august with an exercise price of under the wellman  inc amended and restated stock option plan 
one third of these unvested

this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and waste or spoilage 
such abnormal expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
in addition  this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overhead must be recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
it is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation  currently anticipated to be finalized in the first quarter of  is expected to address diverse accounting practices that have developed with regard to recognizing  derecognizing  or measuring benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
as the exposure draft is currently written  we would be required to recognize in our financial statements  the best estimate of the impact of a tax position  if that tax position is probable of being sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the position 
we are currently evaluating the effect this interpretation will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on our current understanding of the exposure draft  we do not expect the impact to be material 
recent developments during  we recorded pre tax charges totaling million arising primarily from the settlement of all the federal lawsuits of direct purchasers including a class action lawsuit alleging that we engaged in price fixing and customer allocation relating to the sales of polyester staple fiber 
the million charge  which is included in other expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations  represents our best estimate of the total costs including all agreed upon settlements as well as the future costs to defend or settle any remaining litigation including state claims by indirect purchasers 
these agreements contain releases of all claims against us or any of our directors and employees arising from alleged price fixing and market allocation through the date of the settlement 
these settlements cover virtually all of the polyester staple fiber sold in north america from april to july for additional information  see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on august   we shut down our pearl river facility in hancock county  mississippi  in anticipation of hurricane katrina 
the damages caused by the hurricane resulted in a complete loss of production from that date until the first production line  with an annual capacity of million pounds  re started production the week of october  the second production line  with the same annual capacity  re started at the end of november  as of december   we have incurred total costs attributable to hurricane katrina of million  which included the following direct damage to plant site costs incurred to repair and or restore all machinery  equipment  foundations  and buildings to their normal operating condition 
fixed costs salaries  wages  property insurance  electricity  and waste water treatment costs incurred during the shutdown period 
incremental freight costs additional freight costs incurred above our normal freight expense primarily due to the disruption in rail service 
infrastructure support costs to maintain an adequate living environment for both our employees and contract workers starting with the initial repair period and continuing in order to maintain proper staffing levels to operate the plant 
inventory spoilage costs representing the difference between the inventory cost at the time of the hurricane less the net realizable value of inventory that was damaged or spoiled as a result of the hurricane 
rail car damage costs of repairing all of our leased rail cars that were damaged during the hurricane 
rail car leases monthly lease cost related to the rail cars that were damaged and thus inoperable 
we expect to incur additional costs in the first quarter of see outlook below 
we have insurance that covers substantially all of the costs described above as well as any lost profits which is based on the expected production of the facility  resulting from hurricane katrina in excess of our million deductible 
results of operations to the following table summarizes reasons for the changes in from for net sales  cost of sales  and gross profit 
ppg frpg total in millions net selling prices sales volumes foreign currency translation increase in net sales volume effect raw material unit costs plant added unit costs foreign currency translation increase in cost of sales increase in gross profit net selling prices in both the ppg and the frpg increased in response to higher raw material costs and an improved supply demand balance 
the decrease in ppg sales volumes occurred as a result of our pearl river facility losing more than months of production due to hurricane katrina  an increase in pet resins 
table of contents imports into the us in the fourth quarter of as a result of the effects of the recent gulf coast hurricanes  and our attempt in the second quarter of to maintain selling prices and inventory destocking by our customers as prices declined 
these price declines were primarily caused by declines in global raw material costs during the second quarter of  which resulted from a decrease in chinese purchases of polyester chemical raw materials 
the decrease in sales volumes for the frpg is due to our strategic decision to reduce the stated annual polyester staple fiber capacity at our johnsonville  sc facility by approximately million pounds  a continued decline in us textile fiber demand  an increase in imports into the us in the fourth quarter of as a result of the recent gulf coast hurricanes  and poor economic conditions in the european fibers market 
the higher raw material unit costs were due to higher purchase prices in both our chemical and recycled based businesses  which more than offset lower sales volumes 
plant added unit costs were higher overall compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher energy rates and the cost of transitioning our johnsonville facility to its reduced annual capacity of million pounds 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in the higher spending was primarily due to our reinstatement of certain salary and benefit programs effective january  we incurred restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively  related to our cost reduction programs see note to the consolidated financial statements

the following table details other expense  net for and in millions legal costs hurricane katrina costs non capitalizable financing costs rebates from anti dumping duties legal costs consisted of fees  settlements  and other expenses in connection with an investigation by the department of justice which it has since abandoned and related civil litigation 
these amounts increased substantially in  when we settled all the federal claims of any direct purchasers of polyester staple fiber

the non capitalizable financing costs consisted of costs associated with our previous financings that were repaid in the first quarter of for additional information on the february financing  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the us congress enacted the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of the cdo 
under the cdo  any anti dumping duties collected are paid to the injured companies who file claims to that effect 
we received million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease 
table of contents in is primarily due to the higher antidumping duties collected in prior years which were released for distribution among injured companies in and a decrease in the volume of imported fiber subject to antidumping duties 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in interest expense  net  was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased interest rates 
our effective tax rate for on our loss from continuing operations was compared to for our tax rate changed due to the relative proportion of us to foreign earnings  our overall earnings level  and nondeductible compensation payments in foreign earnings are taxed at rates lower than us rates 
in addition  during we incurred tax expense of million as a result of our taking advantage of the lower tax rate on our foreign earnings repatriations as specified under the american jobs creation act 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a loss from continuing operations of million for  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for as a result of the june private equity investment  we recorded accretion based on the fair market value of the increase in the liquidation preference of the preferred stock and the amortization of the discount related to the common stock warrants 
this amount was million and million in and  respectively 
the amount included million  of which million was recorded in the first quarter and million was recorded in the second quarter  which was the amount that the fair market value of the accretion exceeded the book value of the accretion based in part on the value of the underlying common stock 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for to the following table summarizes reasons for the changes in from for net sales  cost of sales  and gross profit 
ppg frpg total in millions net selling prices sales volumes foreign currency translation increase in net sales volume effect raw material unit costs plant added unit costs foreign currency translation increase in cost of sales increase decrease in gross profit net selling price increases were initiated in both segments during in response to higher raw material costs 
sales volumes increased during in both our ppg and frpg primarily as a result of improved supply demand fundamentals and an improved trade balance for us polyester staple fiber and nafta pet resin 

table of contents the higher raw material unit costs in the period are the result of a tight supply demand balance for both chemical and recycled based raw materials and higher crude oil prices for our chemical based businesses 
plant added costs were lower overall compared to the previous year as savings from our cost reduction programs more than offset higher depreciation and amortization  other non cash charges  and energy costs for both the ppg and the frpg 
this allowed for significant reductions in our per unit costs 
the additional depreciation and amortization was principally a result of the february financing 
for additional information on the february financing  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information on our cost reduction programs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease was primarily due to our cost reduction efforts 
for additional information on our cost reduction programs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  we abandoned the polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing equipment at our pearl river facility 
this decision was based on the determination that a conversion to pet resin production would be the most profitable use of the related polymerization assets 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we incurred restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively  related to our cost reduction programs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a charge for expected losses on accounts receivable of million and million in and  respectively 
additional bad debt expense was recorded in primarily due to a bankruptcy where we were a sole sourced supplier and not named as a critical vendor

in october  the us congress enacted the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of the cdo 
under the cdo  any anti dumping duties collected are paid to the injured companies who file claims to that effect 
we received million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to antidumping duties collected in prior years which were released for distribution among the injured companies in as a result of the foregoing  we reported an operating loss of million in compared to million in interest expense  net  was million in compared to million in this was the result of increased long term debt  higher credit spreads  and increased amortization of debt issuance costs in interest expense due to the february financing 

table of contents our effective tax rate for on our loss from continuing operations was compared to for our tax rate decreased due to the lower relative proportion of us to foreign earnings 
foreign earnings are taxed at rates lower than us rates 
in addition  we incurred tax expense of million as a result of our taking advantage of the lower tax rate on our foreign earnings repatriations as specified under the american jobs creation act 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a loss from continuing operations of million for  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for as a result of the june private equity investment  we recorded accretion of the preferred stock liquidation preference  including the amortization of the discount related to the valuation of the common stock warrants  of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  we incurred non cash beneficial conversion charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the preferred stock becoming convertible into common stock 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
our financial results are primarily determined by our sales volumes and raw material margins  which are impacted by industry capacity utilization and the differential in raw material costs between the us and asia 
as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  asian raw material costs became significantly less expensive than us raw material costs which resulted in a dramatic increase in pet resin and polyester staple fiber imports in the fourth quarter of in the beginning of  customers were still utilizing these imports and the difference in raw material costs had not returned to pre katrina levels 
therefore  we believe the first quarter of results could be less than the results in the third quarter of before hurricane katrina 
we have announced selling price increases in our us pet resin business of and per pound effective february  and march   respectively 
in addition  we have announced and per pound selling price increases in our domestic fibers business effective january  and march   respectively 
given the competitive nature of our businesses and other market influences  there can be no assurance that these price increases will be fully realized 
in  we expect to benefit from higher pet resin volumes as we recover our lost sales due to hurricane katrina  and from additional sales from our pet resin expansion of approximately million pounds at our pearl river  mississippi facility that is expected to start in the second quarter if the nafta pet resin industry capacity utilization improves  the differences in raw material costs between the us and asia is reduced  and the aforementioned price increases are realized  our operating results for the last three quarters of should improve significantly over the comparable period in however  there are announced pet resins expansions for late and early that  if these expansions occur as expected  could adversely affect our raw material margins during these periods 
we do not expect to record any additional legal expenses relating to allegations that the company engaged in price fixing relating to sales of polyester staple fiber 
we expect to be reimbursed by insurance in the second half of for substantially all of the costs and any lost profits which is based on the expected production of the facility resulting from hurricane katrina in excess of our million deductible 
in the fourth quarter of  we expect to receive a payment  which we expect to be approximately equal to the amount received in  under the cdo 
the cdo was repealed in february  but us customs will continue to distribute anti dumping duties collected through september  to injured companies 

table of contents capital resources and liquidity net cash provided by operations was million for  compared to net cash used in operations of million for improved operations and the effects of the february financing were principally responsible for this change 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in  compared to million in investing activities for and were comprised of capital expenditures in the amounts of million and million  respectively  and in  also included the purchase of sale leaseback assets of million and the million pre payment of a raw material contract  both in conjunction with the february financing 
the higher capital expenditures in are primarily related to the expansion of pet resin capacity at our pearl river facility 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate our levels primarily due to our pet resin expansion at our pearl river facility 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in the net proceeds from the february financing of million plus million in cash million in total were used to pay balance sheet debt  purchase pet resin assets that were leased under a sale and leaseback transaction  pre pay a raw material contract  purchase accounts receivable  and pay certain financing costs  interest and fees 
we incurred million of non capitalizable financing costs including non cash charges as a part of the february financing 
for additional information on the non capitalizable financing costs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had a total of million in interest rate hedging agreements which were entered into to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt  which are as follows a million fixed rate swap which matures june where we receive three month libor and pay quarterly  a million fixed rate swap which matures july where we receive three month libor and pay quarterly  a million fixed rate swap which matures july where we receive three month libor and pay quarterly  and a million cap which matures july where  for quarterly periods when three month libor exceeds on its reset date  we receive the difference between three month libor and

the credit spread over libor and the prime rate borrowings ranges from to basis points and to basis points  respectively 
we have a million first lien term loan which matures on february   which is primarily secured by our domestic real property  plant and equipment 
our annual interest rate is three month libor plus basis points and is paid quarterly 
there is a libor floor of basis points 
we have a million second lien term loan  which matures on february  which is secured by a second priority interest in substantially all of our domestic assets 
our annual interest rate is three month libor plus basis points and is paid quarterly 
there is a libor floor of basis points 
the amount outstanding is net of the unamortized portion of an original issue discount 
effective july  certain of our foreign subsidiaries entered into a five year million multi currency facility  secured by their trade accounts receivable 
while interest rates vary by currency borrowed  we primarily borrow in euros  and the euro borrowing rate is the bank s prime rate plus at december  
the adjustments are a reduction in the amounts available under the revolving credit facility due to outstanding letters of credit and the mark to market value of outstanding swaps 
for additional information on swaps  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to our debt commitments  we have entered into other commitments and contractual obligations that obligate us to make specified payments in the future 
the following table summarizes the total amounts due as of december  under all debt agreements  commitments and other contractual obligations 
the table indicates the years in which payments  including interest  are due under the contractual obligations 
table ii payments due by period greater than less than years years years year contractual years years years obligations total year beyond in millions debt agreements see table i interest payments on debt agreements operating leases total interest payments on debt agreements include the unamortized portion of an original issue discount 
future interest rates are based on a forward rate curve 
these amounts relate primarily to operating leases for our railcars  computer hardware  and executive offices 
we do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
our debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants 
the terms of the revolving credit facility require that we maintain available liquidity as defined in the revolving credit facility of at least million or maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio initially of at least this ratio increases to beginning with the four quarters ending december  and further increases to beginning with the four quarters ending march  the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility  is earnings before interest  taxes  certain other items and non cash charges 
table of contents primarily depreciation and amortization divided by the sum of cash taxes  cash interest expense  capital expenditures and certain payments related to our equity for the same period 
there are other restrictions which include limitations on capital expenditures  asset sales and dispositions  the incurrence or guarantee of additional debt  acquisitions  certain payments and investments  affiliate and subsidiary transactions  payment of dividends  repurchase of stock  and excess cash 
our current financing agreements permit us to pay a common stock dividend of up to per share in each quarter and restricted payments as defined in the first and second lien term loans can not exceed million in aggregate over the life of the financings 
restricted payments include dividend payments when the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the first and second lien term loans  is below to  stock redemption payments  principal payments of subordinated debt prior to its maturity  and certain investments 
the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the first and second lien term loans  is earnings before interest  taxes  non cash charges primarily depreciation and amortization  extraordinary gains or losses and non recurring and non operational charges or gains divided by interest expense exclusive of any amortization or discounts related to the february financing 
as of december   we have used million of the million limitation on restricted payments 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
the financial resources available to us at december  included approximately million available under our us revolving credit facility and our european facility implemented in july  and internally generated funds 
we have increased our borrowings in the first three months of to rebuild our working capital which was depleted as a result of hurricane katrina and for capital expenditures to complete our pearl river expansion 
these borrowings  coupled with a need to build additional working capital during the second quarter relating to our pearl river expansion  will significantly reduce amounts available to us 
we are considering refinancing some or all of our debt  primarily because we believe we can borrow at lower costs and on more favorable terms 
we believe that we have in place or have access to financial resources which will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends 
for additional information on the payment of dividends  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the majority of these are found at our major manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
for additional information  including changes in the accrued undiscounted liabilities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation 
table of contents progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts  including those made in the outlook section above  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  expects  anticipates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are made as of the date of this report based upon current expectations  and we undertake no obligation to update this information 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to reduced raw material margins  availability and cost of raw materials  reduced sales volumes  increase in costs  polyester staple fiber  textile and pet resin imports  the actions of our competitors  the financial condition of our customers  availability of financing  changes in financial markets  interest rates  credit ratings  tax risks  environmental risks and foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory changes  us  european  asian and global economic conditions  prices and volumes of pet resin imports  work stoppages  levels of production capacity and profitable operations of assets  prices of competing products  natural disasters and acts of terrorism  and maintaining the operations of our existing production facilities 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed herein 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties  which may be more significant to us 
risk related to our business reduced raw material margins could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material margin  which is the difference between our net selling price and the cost of our raw materials  is an extremely important factor in determining our operating results 
selling prices are influenced by competition and capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by total industry capacity 
demand for our product is determined principally by growth in end use markets  substitution of our product for other products  economic conditions  imports  and our products competitive cost position 
supply is determined by worldwide capacity  which is expanding for both pet resin and polyester staple fiber 
any reduction of selling prices  failure to achieve announced selling price increases  or any significant expansion in capacity over demand could reduce our operating results 
any increase in raw material costs see our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials below without a corresponding increase in selling price would reduce our raw material margins and operating results 
a material change in demand  supply  general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg  and to a lesser extent our recycled raw materials 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a small number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  a disruption in their businesses or a failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that we would 
table of contents be able to secure an alternative source of supply at a competitive cost in a timely manner if any of these situations were to occur 
the prices of pta and meg  purchased pursuant to long term contracts  have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future 
recycled raw materials are purchased from many different suppliers  including some under long term supply contracts 
the costs of recycled raw materials are variable and determined by regional and worldwide supply and demand 
reduced sales volume could adversely affect our operating results 
sales volume is another important factor in determining our operating results 
our sales volume is influenced by competition and customer demand 
a material change in demand  supply  general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume and negatively impact our unit costs and operating results 
increases in costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our inability to maintain our cost structure and efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities may reduce our operating results 
in addition  increases in certain non controllable costs where the expense we incur may change based on external factors may reduce our operating results 
examples of these costs are energy  insurance  tax and pension costs 
energy costs are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs and  as these increase  our cost of natural gas  electricity  and oil increases and may reduce our operating results by increasing our production costs 
insurance costs change depending on the market and our experience  and pension costs are impacted by the changes in the equity and debt markets 
polyester staple fiber  textile and pet resin imports could adversely impact our margins 
nafta manufacturers of polyester fiber and pet resins could be severely impacted by imports of fiber  textile products and pet resins  principally from asian countries 
imports of polyester staple fiber  textiles and pet resin continue to cause an over supply which decreases our margins 
the price and volume of imports have and could continue to significantly impact our operating results 
the growth in textile and apparel imports  especially from asia  could have a negative impact on our textile customers 
all remaining quotas on textile and apparel imports into the united states were eliminated as of january  pursuant to the gatt now known as the world trade organization agreement uruguay round agreement enacted in in november  the united states and china reached a new agreement on textile and apparel categories which will limit most apparel imports to a annual growth rate and most textile imports to a annual growth rate for this agreement may limit the growth in textile and apparel imports from china during this period  however  growth in textile and apparel imports may accelerate from other asian countries whose quotas are completely eliminated 
producers of polyester staple fiber and pet resin in the united states and the european union benefit from favorable rules and regulations that affect imports of selected products produced from certain countries 
imports of polyester staple fiber into the european union from australia  india  indonesia  korea  belarus  china  saudi arabia  and thailand are subject to anti dumping and countervailing duties 
pet resin products imported into the european union from australia  china  india  indonesia  korea  malaysia  taiwan and thailand currently have anti dumping duties and for india  malaysia and thailand  countervailing duties 
certain polyester staple products imported into the us from south korea and taiwan are subject to anti dumping duties 
adverse changes in any of these rules or anti dumping or countervailing determinations could affect the demand and selling price for our products and adversely affect our operating results 
the actions of our competitors may adversely affect our operating results 
our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price  product quality  performance or specifications  continuity of supply  customer service and breadth of product line 
major competitors include diversified industrial companies  some of which are larger or have greater financial resources 
changes in a competitor s business behavior may adversely affect our financial performance 
the financial condition of our customers impacts our operating results 
our customers include manufacturers of plastic containers  textile mills  yarn spinners  manufacturers of non woven fabrics  and the injection molding industry 
one customer represented approximately of our 
table of contents ppg s total net sales for and of our total net sales for five customers represented of our ppg s total net sales for our frpg does not have any single customer that accounts for or more of its net sales for if our customers have financial difficulties  this could affect our operating results by decreasing our sales and or resulting in the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the availability and costs of our financing could adversely affect our operating results 
certain events relating to us or the financial markets could reduce our access to financing and or increase our financing costs 
if current business conditions deteriorate or other events occur that result in a breach of our covenants  our lenders would have the right to cause all of our debt to become due and payable 
if this occurs  there is no certainty the debt could be refinanced and  if it were refinanced  we would probably incur increased costs 
for additional information  see capital resources and liquidity above 
additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities 
we have entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of our business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs and future estimated costs for identified environmental situations may change 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies  we could have higher future environmental expenditures than we have estimated 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our operating results occurs in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our financial results and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the financial results of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency and a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivatives we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
we use derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
based on our debt level at december   and the assumption that libor is between and  a basis point increase in libor would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are primarily used to hedge certain accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
