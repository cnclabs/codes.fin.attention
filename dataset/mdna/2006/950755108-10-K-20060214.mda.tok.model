overview the company operates in the truckload sector of the trucking industry  with a focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that ship more consistently throughout the year 
the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
operating revenues consist of trucking revenues generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload transportation services segment dedicated  medium long haul van  regional short haul  expedited  flatbed  and temperature controlled and non trucking revenues generated primarily by the company s vas segment 
the company s truckload transportation services segment truckload segment also includes a small amount of non trucking revenues for the portion of shipments delivered to or from mexico where it utilizes a third party carrier  and for a few of its dedicated accounts where the services of third party carriers are used to meet customer capacity requirements 
non trucking revenues reported in the operating statistics table include those revenues generated by the vas segment  as well as the non trucking revenues generated by the truckload segment 
trucking revenues accounted for of total operating revenues in  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for 
trucking services typically generate revenue on a per mile basis 
other sources of trucking revenue include fuel surcharges and accessorial revenue such as stop charges  loading unloading charges  and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the cost of fuel  these revenues are identified separately within the operating statistics table and are excluded from the statistics to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
non trucking revenues generated by a fleet whose operations are part of the truckload segment are included in non trucking revenue in the operating statistics table so that the revenue statistics in the table are calculated using only the revenues generated by the company owned and owner operator trucks 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  are average revenues per tractor per week  the per mile rates charged to customers  the average monthly miles generated per tractor  the percentage of empty miles  the average trip length  and the average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal freight patterns in the trucking industry  and industry capacity are key factors that impact these statistics 
the company s most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers that recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  there is no assurance that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for a significant portion of cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its revenue equipment and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
a common industry measure used to evaluate the profitability of the company and its trucking operating fleets is the operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the trucking operation are driver salaries and benefits  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  supplies and maintenance  and insurance and claims 
generally  these expenses vary based on the number of miles generated 
as such  the company also evaluates these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers  and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues  including high fuel prices and a challenging driver recruiting and retention market  could cause costs to increase in future periods 
the company s main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
depreciation expense has been affected by the new engine emission standards that became effective in october for all newly purchased trucks  which have increased truck purchase costs 
the trucking operations require substantial cash expenditures for tractors and trailers 
the company has accelerated its normal three year replacement cycle for company owned tractors 
these purchases are funded by net cash from operations and financing available under the company s existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
non trucking services provided by the company  primarily through its vas division  include freight brokerage  intermodal  multimodal  freight transportation management  and other services 
unlike the company s trucking operations  the non trucking operations are less asset intensive and are instead dependent upon information systems  qualified employees  and the services of other third party capacity providers 
the most significant expense item related to these non trucking services is the cost of transportation paid by the company to third party capacity providers  which is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
the company evaluates the non trucking operations by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expense expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating margin 
the operating margin for the non trucking business is lower than those of the trucking operations  but the return on assets is substantially higher 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain industry data regarding the freight revenues and operations of the company for the periods indicated

operating ratio is a common measure in the trucking industry used to evaluate profitability 
net of fuel surcharge revenues the following table sets forth the revenues  operating expenses  and operating income for the truckload segment 
revenues for the truckload segment include non trucking revenues of million  million  and million for   and  respectively  as described on page truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues    operating expenses    operating income    higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections have the effect of increasing the company s consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio 
the following table calculates the truckload segment s operating ratio using total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenues  as a percentage of revenues  excluding fuel surcharges 
eliminating this sometimes volatile source of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues    less trucking fuel surcharge revenues    revenues  net of fuel surcharge    operating expenses    less trucking fuel surcharge revenues    operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge    operating income    the following table sets forth the non trucking revenues  operating expenses  and operating income for the vas segment 
other operating expenses for the vas segment primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits expense 
vas also incurs smaller expense amounts in the supplies and maintenance  depreciation  rent and purchased transportation excluding third party transportation costs  communications and utilities  and other operating expense categories 
value added services amounts in s revenues    rent and purchased transportation expense    gross margin    other operating expenses    operating income   compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and a increase in the average number of tractors in service  offset by a decrease in average annual miles per tractor 
average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due to customer rate increases  and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average loaded trip length 
the truckload freight environment was solid during due to ongoing truck capacity constraints 
in comparison to  demand in the months of march to august was not as strong as the strong freight market of  but freight demand for the remaining months of the year was comparable to the demand in the same periods of the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in the increase in the empty mile percentage is partially the result of a higher percentage of dedicated trucks in the fleet and a higher percentage of regional shipments with a shorter length of haul 
over the past few years  werner has grown its dedicated fleets  arrangements in which the company provides trucks and or trailers for the exclusive use of a specific customer 
for almost all the company s dedicated fleet arrangements  dedicated customers pay the company on an all miles basis loaded or empty to obtain guaranteed truck and or trailer capacity 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  werner classifies a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile ie  deadhead mile 
since dedicated fleets generally have a higher percentage of miles without cargo in the trailer and since the company has been growing its dedicated fleet business  this has contributed to an increase in the company s reported average empty mile percentage 
excluding the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be substantially lower for and during third and fourth quarter  the company s sales and marketing team renewed customer contracts and obtained annual base rate increases for a substantial portion of the company s non dedicated fleet business that renewed in the second half of although the company has taken steps to minimize or delay certain controllable cost increases  base rate increases continue to be necessary to recoup several inflationary cost increases including driver pay and benefits  truck engine emissions costs  and tolls and to improve the company s return on assets 
the company met its goals for these base rate increases in the renewal period 
fuel surcharge revenues  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on the company s margins  the company collects fuel surcharge revenues from its customers 
the company s fuel surcharge programs are designed to recoup the higher cost of fuel from customers when fuel prices rise and provide customers with the benefit of lower costs when fuel prices decline 
the truckload industry s fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile increase in rate for every five cent per gallon increase in the department of energy doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices that are used for most fuel surcharge programs 
these programs have historically enabled the company to recover a significant portion of the fuel price increases 
however  the five cent per gallon brackets only recoup about to of the actual increase in the cost of fuel  due to empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time  and the volatility in fuel prices as prices change rapidly in short periods of time 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in  and gross margin increased for the same period 
vas revenues consist primarily of freight brokerage  intermodal  multimodal  freight transportation management  and other services 
most of the revenue growth came from the company s brokerage and intermodal divisions within vas 
the company continues to focus on growing the volume of business in this segment  which provides customers with additional sources of capacity 
operating expenses the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues was in versus in as explained on page  the significant increase in fuel expense and related fuel surcharge revenues had the effect of increasing the operating ratio 
because the company s vas business operates with a lower operating margin and a significantly higher return on assets than the trucking business  the growth in vas business in compared to also increased the company s overall operating ratio 
the tables on page show the operating ratios and operating margins for the company s two reportable segments  truckload transportation services and value added services 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
the company evaluates operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues and rate per mile increases  which provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
because the change in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles was only minimal  there was essentially no shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
over the past year  attracting and retaining owner operator drivers continued to be very difficult due to high fuel prices and other factors 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to to support the growth in the vas segment 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily the result of increased student driver pay  higher driver pay per mile  and an increase in the number of maintenance employees 
because of the challenging driver recruiting and retention market  discussed below  the company is training more student drivers as an alternative source of drivers 
on august   the company s previously announced two cent per mile pay raise became effective for company solo drivers in its medium to long haul van division  representing approximately of total company drivers 
the company recovered this pay raise through its customer rate increase negotiations  which occurred in third and fourth quarter the driver recruiting and retention market remains extremely challenging 
the supply of truck drivers continues to be constrained due to alternative jobs to truck driving that are available in today s economy and inadequate demographic growth for the industry s targeted driver base over the next several years 
the company continues to focus on driver quality of life issues such as developing more driving jobs with more frequent home time  providing drivers with newer trucks  and maximizing mileage productivity within the federal hours of service regulations 
the company has also placed more emphasis on training drivers 
improved driver recruiting has offset higher driver turnover  however  the company expects the tight driver market will make it very difficult to add meaningful truck capacity in the near future 
the company instituted an optional per diem reimbursement program for eligible company drivers beginning in april this program increases a company driver s net pay per mile  after taxes 
as a result of more drivers electing to participate in the per diem program  driver pay per mile was slightly lower before considering the factors above that increased driver pay per mile  and the company s effective income tax rate was higher in compared to the company expects the cost of the per diem program to be neutral  because the combined driver pay rate per mile and per diem reimbursement under the per diem program is about one cent per mile lower than mileage pay without per diem reimbursement  which offsets the company s increased income taxes caused by the nondeductible portion of the per diem 
the per diem program increases driver satisfaction through higher net pay per mile 
the company anticipates that the competition for drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage were to occur and additional increases in driver pay rates were necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  and it will now report in its financial statements the share based compensation expense for reporting periods beginning in as of the date of this filing  management believes that adopting the new statement will have a negative impact of approximately two cents per share for the year ending december   representing the expense to be recognized for the unvested portion of awards granted to date  and cannot predict the earnings impact of awards that may be granted in the future 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents a gallon  or  higher than in higher fuel costs  after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs and the cost impact of owner operator fuel reimbursements which is included in rent and purchased transportation expense and lower fuel mile per gallon mpg due to truck engine emissions changes  had a ten cent negative impact on earnings per share in compared to company data continues to indicate an approximate fuel mpg degradation for trucks with post october engines of the company owned truck fleet as of december  compared to as of december  
as the company replaces the remaining of the trucks in its fleet that have the pre october engines with trucks with the post october engines  fuel cost per mile is expected to increase further due to the lower mpg 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel price levels will continue to increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
diesel fuel prices for the first six weeks of averaged cents a gallon  or  higher than average fuel prices for first quarter if diesel fuel prices remain at the average price for the first six weeks of  the company estimates that fuel will have a negative impact on first quarter earnings compared to first quarter earnings of three cents to four cents per share 
the company includes the following items in the calculation of the estimated impact of higher fuel costs on earnings fuel pricing  fuel reimbursement to owner operator drivers  lower fuel mpg due to the increasing percentage of company owned trucks with post october engines  and anticipated fuel surcharge reimbursement 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of higher fuel costs on earnings because of changing fuel pricing trends  the temporary lag effect of rapidly changing fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenues  and other factors 
the actual impact of fuel costs on earnings could be higher or lower than estimated due to these factors 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to increases in repair expenses for an increased number of trucks sold by the company s fleet truck sales subsidiary and higher costs to maintain the company s trailer fleet 
higher driver recruiting costs including driver advertising  transportation and lodging and higher toll expense related to state toll rate increases also contributed to a smaller portion of the increase 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile due primarily to the effect of the fuel mpg degradation for company owned trucks with post october engines on the per mile cost of federal and state diesel fuel taxes  as well as increases in some state tax rates 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis  primarily related to higher negative development on existing liability insurance claims 
cargo claims expense was essentially flat on a per mile basis compared to the company renewed its liability insurance policies on august  see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  were approximately the same as the previous policy year 
the company is unable to predict whether the trend of increasing insurance and claims expense will continue in the future 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to higher costs of new tractors with the post october engines 
as of december   approximately of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks with the post october engines  compared to at december  as the company replaces the remaining of the trucks in its fleet that have the pre october engines with trucks with the post october engines  depreciation expense is expected to increase 
rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page  rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in  resulting in a higher gross margin in as the truck capacity market tightened during  it became more difficult to find qualified truckload capacity to meet vas customer freight needs  especially in the latter part of the year 
however  the company s marketing efforts continued to successfully expand its vas qualified carrier base in a constrained capacity market  ending the year with  qualified broker carriers 
the company expects a tight truckload capacity market in with the extremely challenging driver market and historically high fuel prices 
during fourth quarter  vas expanded its small  but growing  intermodal presence by agreeing to manage a fleet of union pacific owned containers for intermodal freight shipments 
the company pays a daily fee per container to union pacific up for any days that the containers are not in transit in the up network 
as of december  vas intermodal was managing up containers 
vas intermodal has the option to  and expects to  increase the number of the up containers in as it further develops its intermodal freight program 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel  which resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
the company s customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned trucks and miles generated by owner operator trucks  thus  the increase in owner operator fuel reimbursements is included with company fuel expenses in calculating the per share impact of higher fuel costs on earnings 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators for over three years because of challenging operating conditions 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors to as of december  from as of december  however  the company has historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decreases in owner operators 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers were to occur and increases in per mile settlement rates became necessary to attract and retain owner operators  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
payments to third party capacity providers used for portions of shipments delivered to or from mexico and by a few dedicated fleets in the truckload segment decreased by cents per mile  partially offsetting the overall increase for the truckload segment 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets  primarily trucks  are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses  including costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in  due to increased unit sales  partially offset by an increased ratio of traded trucks to sold trucks 
the company s wholly owned used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states  with locations  and has been in operation since fleet truck sales continues to be a resource for the company to remarket its used trucks 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
the remaining decrease in other operating expenses in is due primarily to a reduction in computer consulting fees as consultants were hired by the company  resulting in a reduction in other operating expense  but an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
the company recorded million of interest expense in versus virtually no interest expense in the company incurred debt of million during the fourth quarter of and had no debt outstanding throughout the company repaid million of its debt in january and expects to pay down the remaining debt during the first half of  due to expected lower net capital expenditures 
interest income for the company increased to million in from million in due to improved interest rates  partially offset by a declining cash balance throughout the company s effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes increased to in from in  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the income tax rate increased in because of higher non deductible expenses for tax purposes related to the implementation of a per diem pay program for student drivers in fourth quarter and a per diem pay program for eligible company drivers in april the company does not expect its effective income tax rate to increase in compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due to customer rate increases  an improvement in freight selection  and a decrease in the average loaded trip length due to growth in the company s dedicated fleet 
part of the growth in the dedicated fleet was offset by a decrease in the company s medium to long haul van fleet 
dedicated fleet business tends to have lower miles per trip  a higher empty mile percentage  a higher rate per loaded mile  and lower miles per truck 
the growth in dedicated business had a corresponding effect on these same operating statistics  as reported above  for the entire company 
during  the truckload freight environment strengthened due to ongoing truck capacity constraints and a steadily improving economy 
beginning in august  the company s sales and marketing team met with customers to negotiate annual rate increases to recoup the significant cost increases in fuel  driver pay  equipment  and insurance and to improve margins 
much of the company s non dedicated contractual business renewed in the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter 
as a result of these efforts  average revenues per total mile  net of fuel surcharges  rose seven cents a mile  or  sequentially from second quarter to fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in due to higher average fuel prices in these surcharge programs  which automatically adjust depending on the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices  continued in effect throughout typical programs specify a base price per gallon when surcharges can begin to be billed 
above this price  the company bills a surcharge rate per mile when the price per gallon falls in a bracketed range of fuel prices 
when fuel prices increase  fuel surcharges recoup a lower percentage of the incrementally higher costs due to the impact of inadequate recovery for empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time  and bracket creep 
bracket creep occurs when fuel prices approach the upper limit of the bracketed range  but a higher surcharge rate per mile cannot be billed until the fuel price per gallon reaches the next bracket 
also  the doe survey price used for surcharge contracts changes once a week while fuel prices change more frequently 
because collections of fuel surcharges typically trail fuel price changes  rapid fuel price increases cause a temporarily unfavorable effect of fuel prices increasing more rapidly than fuel surcharge revenues 
this effect typically reverses when fuel prices fall 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in  or  and gross margin increased for the same period 
most of this revenue growth came from the company s brokerage group within vas 
during  the expansion of the company s vas services assisted customers by providing needed capacity while driving cost out of their freight network 
operating expenses the company s operating ratio was in versus in because the company s vas business operates with a lower operating margin and a higher return on assets than the trucking business  the substantial growth in vas business in compared to affected the company s overall operating ratio 
as explained on page  the significant increase in fuel expense and related fuel surcharge revenues also affected the operating ratio 
the tables on page show the operating ratios and operating margins for the company s two reportable segments  truckload transportation services and value added services 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
the company evaluates operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues and rate per mile increases  which provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in because the change in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles was only minimal  there was essentially no shift in costs to the rent and purchased transportation category from other expense categories 
during  attracting and retaining owner operator drivers was difficult due to the challenging operating conditions 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to to support the growth in the vas segment 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily the result of higher driver pay per mile 
on august   the company s previously announced two cent per mile pay raise became effective for company solo drivers in its medium to long haul van division  representing approximately of total drivers 
the company recovered a substantial portion of this pay raise through its customer rate increase negotiations 
as a result of the new hours of service regulations effective at the beginning of  the company increased driver pay in the non dedicated fleets for multiple stop shipments 
additional revenue from increased rates per stop offset most of the increased driver pay 
the increase in dedicated business as a percentage of total trucking business also contributed to the increase in driver pay per mile as dedicated drivers are usually compensated at a higher rate per mile due to the lower average miles per truck 
the company s dedicated fleets also typically have higher amounts of loading unloading pay and minimum pay 
during the last quarter of  the market for recruiting experienced drivers tightened 
the company experienced initial improvement in driver turnover after announcing the two cent per mile pay raise that became effective in august  however  that improvement has been difficult to sustain 
alternative jobs with an improving economy  weak population demographics  and competitor pay raises are expected to keep the driver market challenging 
in  the company expanded its student driver training program to attract more drivers to the company and the industry 
the company also offered an increasing percentage of driving jobs with more frequent home time in its dedicated  regional  and network optimization fleets 
the company instituted an optional per diem reimbursement program for eligible company drivers approximately half of total non student company drivers beginning in april this program increases a company driver s net pay per mile  after taxes 
as a result  driver pay per mile was slightly lower before considering the factors above that increased driver pay per mile  and the company s effective income tax rate was higher in compared to fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents a gallon  or  higher than in fuel expense  after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of reimbursement to owner operators  had an eight cent negative impact on earnings per share compared to earnings per share 
in addition to the increase in fuel prices  company data indicated that the fuel mpg degradation for trucks with post october engines of the company owned truck fleet as of december  was a reduction of approximately 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to increases in the cost of over the road repairs and an increase in maintenance on equipment sales related to a larger number of tractors sold through the company s fleet truck sales subsidiary in versus over the road otr repairs increased as a result of the increase in dedicated fleet trucks  which typically do not have as much maintenance performed at company terminals 
the company includes the higher cost of otr maintenance in its dedicated pricing models 
higher driver recruiting costs including driver advertising and driver travel and lodging also contributed to a small portion of the increase 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis  primarily related to liability claims 
cargo claims expense was essentially flat on a per mile basis compared to the company renewed its liability insurance policies on august  effective august   the company became responsible for the first million per claim previously  per claim 
see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  the increased company retention from  to million was due to changes in the trucking insurance market and was similar to increased claim retention levels experienced by other truckload carriers 
liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  decreased approximately million due to the higher retention level 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to higher costs of new tractors with the post october engines 
rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile as higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators for over two years because of challenging operating conditions 
payments to third party capacity providers used for portions of shipments delivered to or from mexico and by a few dedicated fleets in the truckload segment contributed cents of the total per mile increase for the truckload segment 
as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page  rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in  resulting in a higher gross margin in an improving truckload freight environment in resulted in improved customer rates for the vas segment 
additionally  to support the ongoing growth within vas  the group has increased its number of approved third party providers 
this larger carrier base allows vas to more competitively match customer freight with available capacity  resulting in improved margins 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets  primarily trucks  were million in compared to million in in  the company sold about three fourths of its used trucks to third parties and traded about one fourth 
in  the company sold about two thirds of its used trucks and traded about one third 
gains increased due to a larger number of trucks sold in  with a lower average gain per truck 
in july  the company also began recording gains on certain tractor trades in accordance with eitf in   and the first six months of  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks exchanged reduced the cost basis of new trucks 
this change did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees

the remaining million of credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the million in letters of credit the company maintains 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies

with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the other commercial commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for a significant portion of its cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
although the company s normal replacement cycle for tractors is three years  the company calculates depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes using a five year life and salvage value 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner continues at the same straight line rate  which approximates the continuing declining market value of the tractors  in those instances in which a tractor is held beyond the normal three year age 
calculating depreciation expense using a five year life and salvage value results in the same annual depreciation rate of cost per year and the same net book value at the normal three year replacement date of cost as using a three year life and salvage value 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjusts these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable  and it exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows  it is not recoverable 
the company does not separately identify assets by operating segment  as tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of the company s long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all assets of the company 
long lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
the company s self insurance reserves are reviewed by an actuary every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider is utilized to provide some or all of the service and the company is the primary obligor in regards to the delivery of the shipment  establishes customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  generally has discretion in carrier selection  and or has credit risk on the shipment  the company records both revenues for the dollar value of services billed by the company to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for the costs of transportation paid by the company to the third party provider upon delivery of the shipment 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  the company records revenues net of expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial circumstances were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  judgment would need to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the interest rates on the variable rate debt are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
assuming this level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the libor interest rate would increase the company s annual interest expense by  the company has no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in mexico and canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows 
to date  virtually all foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and the company receives payment for freight services performed in mexico and canada primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk
