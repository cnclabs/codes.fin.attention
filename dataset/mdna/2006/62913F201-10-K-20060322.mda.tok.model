risk factors for risks and uncertainties that may impact our future performance 
a 
executive overview our principal objective is to grow our business in selected markets in latin america by providing differentiated  high value wireless communications services to business customers  while improving profitability and cash flow 
we intend to continue growing our business in a balanced manner  with a primary focus on generating earnings growth and free cash flow and maintaining appropriate controls on costs and capital expenditures 
we will seek to add subscribers at rates which do not negatively impact our operating metrics 
we may also explore financially attractive opportunities to expand our network coverage in areas where we currently do not provide wireless service 
based on the relatively low wireless penetration in our markets and our current market share in our target customer segment  we believe that we can continue our current subscriber and revenue growth trends while improving our profitability and cash flow generation 
although certain latin american markets have been historically volatile  the latin american markets that we serve have recently experienced improving economies that have been relatively more stable compared to historical periods 
we believe we will be successful in meeting our objectives by focusing on major business centers in key latin american markets 
we operate primarily in large urban markets in latin america that have a concentration of high usage business customers  including the five largest cities in latin america 
we target these markets because we believe they offer favorable long term growth prospects for our wireless communications services 
in addition  the cities in which we operate account for a high proportion of total economic activity in each of their respective countries and provide us with a large potential market without the need to build out nationwide wireless coverage 
we believe that there are significant opportunities for growth in these markets due to relatively low overall wireless penetration rates and the large number of target business customers 
we have licenses in markets that cover about million people  of which our network coverage extends to about million people 
targeting high value business customers 
our main focus is on high end  post paid customers with medium to high usage  targeting primarily businesses because they value our multi function handsets and our high level of customer service 
our typical customers have between and handsets  while some of our largest customers have over handsets under contract 
we believe that our focus on these business customers is a key reason why we have a significantly higher monthly average revenue per unit than that reported by our competitors 
providing differentiated services 
we have traditionally been the only wireless service provider in mexico  peru and brazil that offers digital mobile telephone service and push to talk digital radio communication  fully integrated in a single wireless device in  among and throughout our service areas in each of these countries 
our unique direct connect push to talk service provides significant value to our customers by eliminating the long distance and domestic roaming fees charged by other wireless service providers  while also providing added functionality due to the near instantaneous nature of the communication and the ability to communicate on a one to many basis 
our competitors have begun to introduce competitive push to talk over cellular products  but we believe that the quality of our direct connect service is superior at this time 
we add further value by customizing data applications that enhance the productivity of our business customers  such as vehicle and delivery tracking  order entry processing and workforce monitoring applications 
we also provide international direct connect service  in conjunction with nextel communications  nextel partners and telus  which allows subscribers to communicate instantly across national borders with our subscribers in mexico  brazil  argentina and peru and with nextel communications and nextel partners subscribers in the united states and telus subscribers in canada 
delivering superior customer service 
in addition to our unique service offerings  we seek to further differentiate ourselves by providing a higher level of customer service generally than our competitors 
we work proactively with our customers to match them with service plans offering greater value 
after analyzing customer usage and expense data  we strive to minimize a customer s per minute costs while increasing overall usage of our array of services  thereby providing higher value to our customers while increasing our monthly revenues 
this goal is also furthered by our efforts during and after the sales process to educate customers about our services  multi function handsets and rate plans 
in addition  we have implemented proactive customer retention and customer for life programs to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
we believe that many of our competitors  who have primarily lower revenue generating prepaid customer bases  do not generally offer the same level of service to customers 
selectively expanding our service areas 
we believe that we have significant opportunities to grow through selective expansion of our service into additional areas within the countries in which we currently operate 
such expansion may involve building out certain areas in which we already have spectrum  obtaining additional mhz spectrum in new areas which would enable us to expand our network service areas  and further developing our business in key urban areas along the us mexico border 
in addition  we may consider selectively expanding into other latin american countries where we do not currently operate 
as a result of the spectrum that we won in the march spectrum auctions in mexico  we plan to significantly expand our service areas in mexico over the next several years and increase our covered population from about million to about million 
similarly  we plan to expand our service area in brazil and increase our covered population from about million at the beginning of to at least million over the next several years 
see capital expenditures for a discussion of the factors that drive our capital spending 
we refer to our operating companies by the countries in which they operate  such as nextel mexico  nextel brazil  nextel argentina  nextel peru and nextel chile 
see item a 
risk factors for information on risks and uncertainties that could affect the above objectives 
foreign currency exposure nearly all of our revenues are denominated in non us currencies  although a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures  including imported network equipment and handsets  and a substantial portion of our outstanding debt  are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and assets 
for example  the economic upheaval in argentina in led to the unpegging of the argentine peso to the us dollar exchange rate and the subsequent significant devaluation of the argentine peso 
as a result  we recognized significant foreign currency transaction losses in argentina in and our revenues and earnings were significantly adversely affected 
any depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which our operating companies conduct business may also result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may  at the same time  decrease demand for our products and services in the affected markets 
additional information regarding the impact of currency rates is included in the discussion of our segments under results of operation 
recent developments financing and hedging activities mexico syndicated loan facility 
in october  nextel mexico closed on a million  five year syndicated loan facility 
of the total amount of the facility  million is denominated in us dollars with a floating interest rate based on libor as of december   million is denominated in mexican pesos with a floating interest rate based on the mexican reference rate  the interbank equilibrium interest rate  or tiie as of december   and million is denominated in mexican pesos at an interest rate fixed at the time of funding 
in april  nextel mexico amended the credit agreement for the syndicated loan facility to extend the availability period until may   and in may  nextel mexico drew down on the loan facility for the entire million 
conversion of convertible notes 
on june  and june   certain noteholders converted million and million  respectively  principal face amount of our convertible notes into  shares and  shares shares issued per  of debt principal multiplied by the debt principal in accordance with the original terms of the debt securities 
in connection with these conversions  we paid in the aggregate million in cash as additional consideration for conversion  as well as million of accrued and unpaid interest 
we recorded the million that we paid as debt conversion expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we reclassified to paid in capital the original remaining deferred financing costs related to the notes that were converted 
interest rate swap 
in july  nextel mexico entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability of future cash flows associated with the million mexican peso denominated variable rate portion of its million syndicated loan facility 
under the interest rate swap  nextel mexico agreed to exchange the difference between the variable mexican reference rate  tiie  and a fixed rate  based on a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap fixed the amount of interest expense associated with this portion of the syndicated loan facility commencing on august  and will continue over the life of the facility based on a fixed rate of about per year in local mexican currency 
convertible notes 
in august  we privately placed million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due  which we refer to as our notes 
in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which the initial purchaser exercised in full 
as a result  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of notes  resulting in total gross proceeds of million 
we also incurred direct issuance costs of million  which we recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortizing over five years 
the notes were publicly registered  effective february  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year  beginning february   and will mature on august   when the entire principal balance of million will be due 
in addition  the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes on august of   and at a repurchase price equal to of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest including additional amounts  if any up to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
the notes are convertible into  shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date under certain circumstances we have the option to satisfy the conversion of the notes in shares of our common stock  in cash or a combination of both 
prior to august   the notes are not redeemable 
on or after august   we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes  at any time and from time to time  upon at least days notice for a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest including additional amounts  if any up to  but excluding  the redemption date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our notes 
foreign currency hedge 
in september  nextel mexico entered into a derivative agreement to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with million of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk is hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases for a month period beginning in january under this agreement  nextel mexico purchased a us dollar call option for million and sold a call option on the mexican peso for million for a net cost of million 
in october  nextel mexico entered into another derivative agreement to further reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with million of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk is similarly hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases for a month period beginning in january under this agreement  nextel mexico purchased a us dollar call option for million and sold a call option on the mexican peso for million for a net cost of million 
acquisitions mexico spectrum auction 
on january   the mexican government began an auction for wireless spectrum licenses in the mhz to mhz frequency band 
inversiones nextel de mexico  a subsidiary of nextel mexico  participated in this auction 
the spectrum auction was divided into three separate auctions auction for northern mexico zone  auction for northern mexico zone and auction for central and southern mexico 
the auctions were completed between february and february nextel mexico won an average of mhz of nationwide spectrum  except for mexico city  where no spectrum was auctioned and where nextel mexico already has approximately mhz of spectrum licenses 
the corresponding licenses and immediate use of the spectrum were granted to inversiones nextel de mexico on march  these new licenses have an initial term of years  which we have estimated to be the amortization period of the licenses  and are renewable thereafter for years 
nextel mexico paid an up front fee of million for these licenses  excluding certain annual fees  and million in other capitalizable costs 
the spectrum licenses that nextel mexico acquired will allow it to significantly expand its digital mobile network over the next two years  thereby allowing it to cover a substantial portion of the mexican national geography and population 
purchase of aol mexico 
in april  nextel mexico purchased the entire equity interest of aol mexico  s 
de rl de rl for approximately million in cash 
as a result of this transaction  nextel mexico obtained aol mexico s call center assets  certain accounts receivable and access to aol mexico s customer list  as well as tax loss carryforwards  which we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
we accounted for this transaction as a purchase of assets 
this acquisition is a related party transaction as one of our board members is also the president and chief executive officer of aol latin america 
due to this board member s involvement with our company  he recused himself from our decision to make this acquisition 
brazil spectrum purchases 
during the second quarter of  nextel brazil acquired spectrum licenses for million  of which it paid million 
the remaining million is due in six annual installments beginning in  and we are amortizing these licenses over years 
other servico movel especializado sme regulations in brazil 
on may   the brazilian national communications agency  or anatel  enacted certain substantive modifications to the sme regulations that  among other things  have the effect of treating nextel brazil equal to all other brazilian smr and sme carriers with respect to billing for use of other mobile networks 
these modifications to the sme regulations became immediately effective and resulted in savings for nextel brazil in relation to interconnect charges made by other carriers 
stock split 
on october   we announced a for common stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend  which was paid on november  to holders of record on november  all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k related to nii holdings  inc reflect the common stock split 
amendments to infrastructure supply and installation services agreements 
in december  we and each of our operating companies entered into various amendments to our existing infrastructure supply and installation services agreements with motorola  inc to extend the terms of these agreements to december  out of period adjustments during the year ended december   we identified errors in our financial statements for the year ended december  these errors primarily related to accounting for income taxes  a corporate aircraft lease  bookkeeping errors in our operating company in mexico and other miscellaneous items 
for the year ended december   we reduced operating income by million and increased net income by million  respectively  related to the correction of these errors 
in connection with certain balance sheet errors  during the year ended december   we increased total assets by approximately million  total liabilities by approximately million and stockholders equity by approximately million 
we do not believe that these adjustments are material to the financial statements for the year ended december  or to any prior periods 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for additional disclosures related to the aircraft lease and income tax adjustments  respectively 
corporate aircraft leases in april  we entered into an agreement to lease a corporate aircraft for eight years for the purpose of enabling company employees to visit and conduct business at our various operating companies in latin america 
we originally accounted for this agreement as an operating lease 
however  upon further analysis and review  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that because of certain cross default provisions in the lease  we should account for the agreement as a capital lease under eitf  implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities 
as a result of this and due to a lease modification of the existing aircraft lease  in the fourth quarter of  we revised the accounting for this agreement to a capital lease and recorded a capital lease asset and capital lease liability for the present value of the future minimum lease payments 
we also adjusted our general and administrative expenses  depreciation and interest expense to reflect the change from an operating lease to a capital lease 
in november  we entered into an agreement to lease a new corporate aircraft beginning in for ten years 
we refer to this aircraft lease as the aircraft lease 
this new aircraft  which is scheduled to be delivered in may  will replace the existing corporate aircraft that we are currently leasing 
we determined that in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  we are the owner of this new corporate aircraft during its construction because we have substantially all of the construction period risks 
as a result  we will record an asset for construction in progress and a corresponding long term liability for the new aircraft as construction occurs 
when construction of the new corporate aircraft is complete and the lease term begins  we will record the aircraft lease as a sale and a leaseback and evaluate the classification of the lease as capital versus operating at that time 
upon taking delivery of the new aircraft in may  we are required to immediately exercise our early purchase option on the existing aircraft and pay all amounts due under the aircraft lease 
if we fail to take delivery of the new aircraft and acquire the existing aircraft  we will be subject to certain penalties under the aircraft lease and the aircraft lease 
if we take delivery of the new aircraft and acquire the existing aircraft  we intend to immediately sell the existing aircraft 
in addition  we signed a demand promissory note to guarantee the total advance payments for the construction of the new aircraft to be financed by the lessor under the aircraft lease 
the first scheduled advance payment occurred in november the lessor committed to make advance payments of up to million during the construction of the new aircraft 
we also provided a million letter of credit to the lessor as security for the first advance payment  which we paid in the fourth quarter of to secure our obligations under the letter of credit agreement  we deposited approximately million in a restricted cash account with the bank issuing the letter of credit 
we have classified this amount as a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  under the aircraft lease  we are obligated to increase the amount of the letter of credit up to a maximum of million as the lessor makes advance payments 
under the terms of this promissory note  we are required to maintain unencumbered cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and highly liquid investments of no less than million at all times 
interest accrues on the portion of the outstanding principal amount of the promissory note that is equal to or less than million  at a variable rate of interest  adjusted monthly  equal to the monthly libor rate plus per year and the portion of the outstanding principal amount of the note in excess of million  at a variable rate of interest  adjusted monthly  equal to the monthly libor rate plus per year 
as of december   we recorded an asset and a corresponding liability of million for the amount outstanding under this promissory note 
in addition  for the year ended december   we have accrued for interest on the million outstanding balance 
brazilian contingencies nextel brazil has received various assessment notices from state and federal brazilian authorities asserting deficiencies in payments related primarily to value added taxes and import duties based on the classification of equipment and services 
nextel brazil has filed various administrative and legal petitions disputing these assessments 
in some cases  nextel brazil has received favorable decisions  which are currently being appealed by the respective governmental authority 
in other cases  nextel brazil s petitions have been denied  and nextel brazil is currently appealing those decisions 
nextel brazil is also disputing various other claims 
as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain contingencies  during the year ended december   nextel brazil reversed million in accrued liabilities  of which we recorded million as a reduction to operating expenses and the remainder to other income  which represented monetary corrections 
during the year ended december   nextel brazil reduced its liabilities by million  of which we recorded million as a reduction to operating expenses  reclassified million of a settled claim to current liabilities for payment  and recorded the remainder  which primarily included monetary corrections on these contingencies  in other income 
during  we reversed million in liabilities 
of this total  we recorded million as a reduction to operating expenses and the remainder to other income 
as of december   nextel brazil had accrued liabilities of million related to contingencies  all of which were classified in tax and non tax accrued contingencies reported as a component of other long term liabilities 
as of december   nextel brazil had accrued liabilities of million related to contingencies  of which million were classified as other long term liabilities and million were classified as accrued expenses 
the balance related to accrued contingencies increased from primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
of the total accrued liabilities as of december  and  nextel brazil had million and million in unasserted claims  respectively 
we currently estimate the range of possible losses related to matters for which nextel brazil has not accrued liabilities  as they are not deemed probable  to be between million and million as of december  we are continuing to evaluate the likelihood of probable and reasonably possible losses  if any  related to all known contingencies 
as a result  future increases or decreases to our accrued liabilities may be necessary and will be recorded in the period when such amounts are probable and estimable 
argentine contingencies turnover tax 
in one of the markets in which we operate in argentina  the city government had previously increased the turnover tax rate from to of revenues for cellular companies 
from a regulatory standpoint  we are not considered a cellular company 
as a result  we continue to pay the turnover tax at the existing rate and record a liability for the differential between the old rate and the new rate 
similarly  one of the provincial governments in one of the markets where we operate also increased their turnover tax rate from to of revenues for cellular companies 
consistent with our earlier position  we continue to pay the turnover tax at the existing rate and accrue a liability for the incremental difference in the rate 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  as increases in liabilities for local turnover taxes 
universal service tax 
during the year ended december   the argentine government enacted the universal service regulation  which established a tax on telecommunications licensees effective january   equal to of telecommunications service revenue  net of applicable taxes and specified related costs 
the license holder can choose either to pay the tax into a fund for universal service development or to participate directly in offering services to specific geographical areas under an annual plan designed by the federal government 
although the regulations state that this tax would be applicable beginning january   the authorities have not  until recently  taken the necessary actions to implement this tax  such as creating policies relating to collection or opening accounts into which the funds would be deposited 
as of december   the accrual for this liability to the government was million  which is included as a component of total accrued liabilities of million as of december  nextel argentina billed this tax as universal tax on customer invoices during the period from january to august for a total amount of million 
subsequent to august  nextel argentina did not segregate a specific charge or identify any portion of its customer billings as relating to the universal tax and  in fact  raised its rates and service fees to customers several times after this period unrelated to the universal tax 
as of december  and  we had accrued million from january to august for the refund 
in may  the secretariat of communications  or the sc  passed legislation stating that the fee was an obligation of the service provider and could not be assessed to its clients 
the sc also instructed the national communication commission  or the cnc  to request operators to reimburse all amounts collected 
in july  the cnc issued a resolution which required operators to reimburse amounts collected  plus interest  within days 
in october  nextel argentina sought a judicial injunction against the resolution passed in july shortly thereafter  the sc rejected nextel argentina s administrative claim and separately repealed the legislation passed in july that required operators to reimburse amounts collected  plus interest 
the sc also instructed the cnc to issue new resolutions on a case by case basis 
as a result  the cnc ordered nextel argentina to reimburse amounts collected as universal service  plus interest  using the same methodology and rate that nextel argentina utilizes to calculate interest charged to late paying customers 
in november  nextel argentina filed an administrative claim and sought a judicial injunction against the legislation passed in may the administrative claim and the judicial injunction that nextel argentina filed in november are still pending 
also  in the fourth quarter of  consumer advocate organizations started taking a more active role in this matter by filing administrative pleadings and judicial claims against other telecommunications operators 
in december  nextel argentina was notified that a consumer group filed a claim against nextel argentina to reimburse all amounts collected as universal tax 
as a result of the events described above and an opinion of counsel  during the fourth quarter of  nextel argentina accrued million for the amount due to its clients for the period from september to december as a reduction of operating revenues 
in addition  nextel argentina accrued million for interest related to these charges  which we classified as interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
the total amount of million is included as a component of total accrued liabilities of million as of december  as of december  and  nextel argentina had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  related primarily to local turnover taxes and local government claims  all of which were classified in tax and non tax accrued contingencies reported as a component of accrued expenses and other 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
while our revenue recognition policy does not require the exercise of significant judgment or the use of significant estimates  we believe that our policy is significant as revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
operating revenues primarily consist of service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of digital handsets and accessories 
in addition  operating revenues are presented net of valued added taxes and gross of certain revenue based taxes 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio and other services including revenues from calling party pays programs where applicable and variable charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges and international roaming revenues derived from calls placed by our customers on other carriers networks 
we also have other sources of revenues 
other revenues primarily include amounts generated from our handset maintenance programs  roaming revenues generated from other companies customers that roam on our networks and co location rental revenues from third party tenants that rent space on our towers 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the following are the policies applicable to our major categories of revenue transactions 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts 
we recognize excess usage  local  long distance and calling party pays revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we record cash received in excess of revenues earned as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue generated from our handset maintenance programs on a monthly basis at fixed amounts over the service period 
we recognize roaming revenues at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we recognize co location revenues from third party tenants on a monthly basis based on the terms set by the underlying agreements 
we bill excess usage to our customers in arrears 
in order to recognize the revenues originated from excess usage subsequent to customer invoicing through the end of the reporting period  we estimate the unbilled portion based on the usage that the handset had during the part of the month already billed  and we use this actual usage to estimate the unbilled usage for the rest of the month taking into consideration working days and seasonality 
our estimates are based on our experience in each market 
we periodically evaluate our estimation process by comparing our estimates to actual excess usage revenue billed the following month 
as a result  actual usage could differ from our estimates 
we recognize revenue from handset and accessory sales when title and risk of loss passes upon delivery of the handset or accessory to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses 
our methodology for determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
since we have several hundred thousand accounts  it is impracticable to review the collectibility of all individual accounts when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable each period 
therefore  we consider a number of factors in establishing the allowance on a market by market basis  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  agings of the accounts receivable portfolio and other factors 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment 
our business is capital intensive because of our digital mobile networks 
we record at cost our digital network assets and other improvements that in our opinion  extend the useful lives of the underlying assets  and depreciate the assets over their estimated useful lives 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of to years for digital mobile network equipment and software and to years for office equipment  furniture and fixtures  and other 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the improvements 
our digital mobile networks are highly complex and  due to constant innovation and enhancements  certain components of the networks may lose their utility faster than anticipated 
we periodically reassess the economic life of these components and make adjustments to their expected lives after considering historical experience and capacity requirements  consulting with the vendor and assessing new product and market demands and other factors 
when these factors indicate network components may not be useful for as long as originally anticipated  we depreciate the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives 
further  the timing and deployment of any new technologies could affect the estimated remaining useful lives of our digital network assets  which could significantly impact future results of operations 
amortization of intangible assets 
we record our licenses at historical cost and amortize them using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of to years 
the terms of our licenses  including renewals  range from to years 
however  the wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change 
future technological advancements may render iden technology obsolete 
additionally  the political and regulatory environments in the markets we serve are continuously changing and  in many cases  the renewal fees could be significant 
therefore  we do not view the renewal of our licenses to be perfunctory 
as a result  we classify our licenses as finite lived assets 
our licenses and the requirements to maintain the licenses are subject to renewal after the initial term  provided that we have complied with applicable rules and policies in each of our markets 
we intend to comply  and believe we have complied  with these rules and policies in all material respects 
however  because governmental authorities have discretion as to the grant or renewal of licenses  our licenses may not be renewed  which could have a significant impact on our estimated useful lives 
this would affect our results of operations in the future 
foreign currency 
we translate the results of operations for our non us subsidiaries and affiliates from the designated functional currency to the us dollar using average exchange rates during the period  while we translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect at the reporting date 
we report the resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements as other comprehensive income or loss 
because average exchange rates are used to translate the operations of our non us subsidiaries  our operating companies trends may be impacted by the translation 
for example  in country us dollar based trends may be accentuated or attenuated by changes in translation rates 
we report the effects of changes in exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated assets and liabilities as foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
with regard to intercompany loans and advances to our foreign subsidiaries that are of a long term investment nature and that are not expected to be settled in the forseeable future  we report the effects of changes in exchange rates as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in our consolidated financial statements 
we view the intercompany loans and advances from our us subsidiaries to nextel brazil and nextel chile and an intercompany payable due to nextel mexico as of a long term investment nature 
in contrast  we report the effects of exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated intercompany loans and advances to our foreign subsidiaries that are due  or for which repayment is anticipated  in the foreseeable future  as foreign currency transaction gains  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  our determination of whether intercompany loans and advances are of a long term investment nature can have a significant impact on the calculation of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and the foreign currency translation adjustment 
loss contingencies 
we account for and disclose loss contingencies such as pending litigation and actual or possible claims and assessments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we accrue for loss contingencies if it is probable that a loss will occur and if the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose loss contingencies if it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur and if the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not accrue for or disclose loss contingencies if there is only a remote possibility that the loss will occur 
sfas no 
requires us to make judgments regarding future events  including an assessment relating to the likelihood that a loss may occur and an estimate of the amount of such loss 
in assessing loss contingencies  we often seek the assistance of our legal counsel and in some instances  of third party legal counsel 
as a result of the significant judgment required in assessing and estimating loss contingencies  actual losses realized in future periods could differ significantly from our estimates 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we have chosen to continue to apply apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our employee related stock plans 
accordingly  in each period  we used the intrinsic value method to record stock based employee compensation 
we do not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the trading price per share of our common stock on the grant date 
we account for stock based compensation to non employees at fair value using a black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and other applicable accounting principles 
since compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of options rather than the intrinsic value  if we had applied sfas no 
to all stock based compensation  our results of operations would have been different 
effective january   we will apply the provisions in statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which will require that we expense the cost of stock options and other forms of shared based payments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for further information surrounding the effect of applying sfas no

income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  as well as for tax loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based upon the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we report remeasurement gains and losses related to deferred tax assets and liabilities in our income tax provision 
a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets that  if realized  will not result in a benefit to our income tax provision 
in accordance with sop  we recognize decreases in the valuation allowance existing at the reorganization date first as a reduction in the carrying value of intangible assets existing at the reorganization date and then as an increase to paid in capital 
as of december   we reduced to zero the carrying value of our intangible assets existing at the reorganization date 
we will record the future decreases  if any  of the valuation allowance existing on the reorganization date as an increase to paid in capital 
we will record decreases  if any  of the post reorganization valuation allowance as a benefit to our income tax provision 
in accordance with apb  we recognize decreases in the valuation allowance attributable to the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options as an increase to paid in capital 
in each market  we recognize decreases in the valuation allowance first as a decrease in the remaining valuation allowance that existed as of the reorganization date  then as a decrease in any post reorganization valuation allowance  and finally as a decrease of the valuation allowance associated with stock option deductions 
realization of deferred tax assets in any of our markets depends on continued future profitability in these markets 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  technology trends  political uncertainties  competitive pressures and other factors beyond management s control 
if our operations continue to demonstrate profitability  we may further reverse additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances during we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances in all of our foreign operating companies and in our us companies throughout to determine the appropriate level of valuation allowances

results of operation operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of digital handsets and accessories 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio and other services  including revenues from calling party pays programs and variable charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges and international roaming revenues derived from calls placed by our customers 
digital handset and accessory revenues represent revenues we earn on the sale of digital handsets and accessories to our customers 
in addition  we also have other less significant sources of revenues 
these revenues primarily include revenues generated from our handset maintenance programs  roaming revenues generated from other companies customers that roam on our networks and co location rental revenues from third party tenants that rent space on our towers 
see revenue recognition above and note to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for a description of our revenue recognition methodology 
cost of revenues primarily includes the cost of providing wireless service and the cost of digital handset and accessory sales 
cost of providing service consists largely of costs of interconnection with local exchange carrier facilities and direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  including property taxes  expenses related to our handset maintenance programs  insurance costs  utility costs  maintenance costs and rent for the network switches and sites used to operate our digital mobile networks 
interconnection costs have fixed and variable components 
the fixed component of interconnection costs consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers 
the variable component of interconnection costs  which fluctuates in relation to the volume and duration of wireless calls  generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for wireless calls from our digital handsets terminating on their networks 
cost of digital handset and accessory sales consists largely of the cost of the handset and accessories  order fulfillment and installation related expenses  as well as write downs of digital handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage or obsolescence 
our service and other revenues and the variable component of our cost of service are primarily driven by the number of digital handsets in service and not necessarily by the number of customers  as one customer may purchase one or many digital handsets 
our digital handset and accessory revenues and cost of digital handset and accessory sales are primarily driven by the number of new handsets placed into service as well as handset upgrades provided to existing customers during the year 
selling and marketing expenses includes all of the expenses related to acquiring customers 
general and administrative expenses include expenses related to revenue based taxes  billing  customer care  collections including bad debt  management information systems  spectrum license fees and corporate overhead

the million  or  increase in consolidated digital handset and accessory revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in handset sales  as well as a increase in handset upgrades 
cost of revenues the million  or  increase in consolidated cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is principally a result of the following a million  or  increase in consolidated interconnect costs resulting from a increase in consolidated interconnect minutes of use  a million  or  increase in consolidated direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs resulting from a increase in the number of consolidated transmitter and receiver sites in service from december  to december   and a million  or  increase in consolidated service and repair costs mainly resulting from an increase in subscribers participating under our handset maintenance programs  primarily in mexico and brazil 
the million  or  increase in consolidated cost of digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in handset sales and a increase in handset upgrades 
selling and marketing expenses the million  or  increase in consolidated selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is principally a result of the following a million  or  increase in consolidated indirect commissions resulting from a increase in handset sales earned by outside dealers  a million  or  increase in consolidated direct commissions and payroll expenses largely due to an increase in commissions incurred as a result of a increase in handset sales across all markets by internal sales personnel  and a million  or  increase in consolidated advertising expenses  primarily in mexico and brazil  mainly related to the launch of new markets and increased advertising initiatives related to overall subscriber growth 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a million  or  increase in consolidated other general and administrative expenses largely due to million related to the gross up of revenue based taxes in brazil  an increase in headcount and facilities related expenses due to continued subscriber growth and an increase in corporate professional fees related to the annual financial and sarbanes oxley audit and legal services  a million  or  increase in consolidated customer care expenses resulting from an increase in payroll and related expenses necessary to support a larger consolidated customer base  a million  or  increase from million to million in spectrum license fees  and a million  or  increase in consolidated bad debt expense  which increased slightly as a percentage of revenues from in to in  primarily in brazil and mexico 
we do not expect bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues to increase significantly in future periods 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is also due to a million reversal of contingent liabilities in brazil that we recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   partially offset by million of net reversals of contingent liabilities in brazil related to the expiration of the statute of limitations that we recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of we are continuing to evaluate the likelihood of probable and reasonably possible losses  if any  related to all known contingencies 
as a result  future increases or decreases to our accrued liabilities may be necessary and will be recorded in the period when such charge is probable and estimable 
depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased deprecation on a larger base of consolidated property  plant and equipment resulting from continued expansion of our digital mobile networks  partially offset by a decrease in amortization 
the decrease in amortization resulted from reversals that we recorded primarily in the fourth quarter of of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
we recorded the reversals of valuation allowances as reductions to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting 
interest expense  net the million  or  increase in consolidated net interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a million increase in interest incurred related to our syndicated loan facility in mexico that we drew down in may and an million increase in interest related to our tower financing obligations in mexico and brazil  partially offset by a million decrease in interest resulting from the principal pay downs of our international equipment facility in february and july and a million decrease in interest resulting from the retirement of our senior secured discount notes during the first quarter of interest income the million  or  increase in interest income from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely the result of increases in nextel mexico s average consolidated cash balances due to the draw down of nextel mexico s million syndicated loan facility in may and cash generated from operations  as well as interest earned in the us on the million proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible notes in august foreign currency transaction gains  net foreign currency transaction gains  net  during the years ended december  and are primarily related to gains in mexico due to the impact of increases in the average values of the mexican peso on nextel mexico s us dollar denominated liabilities 
debt conversion expense the million debt conversion expense represents consideration that we paid in connection with the conversion of million of our convertible notes during the second quarter of loss on early extinguishment of debt the million loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  represents the loss that we incurred in connection with the retirement of substantially all of our senior secured discount notes through a cash tender offer in the first quarter of other expense  net the million  or  increase in other expense  net  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely due to million in realized losses related to nextel mexico s hedge of capital expenditures and handset purchases that we reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during income tax provision the million  or  increase in the income tax provision from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a million increase in income before tax  partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate attributable to a large addition to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in that did not recur in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net the million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december  represents net income for our foreign operating companies for the one month ended december  we accounted for the elimination of the one month lag reporting policy as a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no

segment results we evaluate performance of our segments and provide resources to them based on operating income before depreciation and amortization and impairment  restructuring and other charges  which we refer to as segment earnings 
we allocated million  million and million in corporate overhead costs to nextel mexico during the years ended december   and  respectively  and we treat a portion of these allocated amounts as tax deductions  where relevant

nextel mexico s profitability is a result of subscriber growth with increasing average revenues per subscriber and operating costs maintained relatively in line with revenues 
additional subscriber growth was the result of selectively expanding coverage in new markets and improving network quality and capacity 
coverage expansion and network improvements were attributable to capital expenditures totaling million for the year ended december  and a share of all capital expenditure investments that we made during  a trend that we expect will likely continue in the near future 
average revenues per subscriber improved due to the implementation of new rate plans  increased minutes of use in interconnect and dispatch traffic and favorable exchange rates 
nextel mexico also decreased its customer turnover by making concentrated investments in customer retention programs 
we expect subscriber growth in mexico to continue as we build out new markets over the next one to two years using spectrum licenses that we acquired in march in the mhz auctions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we translated nextel mexico s results of operations using the average exchange rate for the year ended december  the average exchange rate of the mexican peso for the year ended december  appreciated in value against the us dollar by from the year ended december  as a result  compared to  the components of nextel mexico s results of operations for after translation into us dollars reflect higher increases than would have occurred if it were not for the impact of the appreciation in the average value of the peso

consistent with this improved economic environment  nextel argentina has continued growing its subscriber base  significantly lowering its customer turnover and reducing its bad debt expense while substantially increasing its operating revenues 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding economic conditions in argentina  we cannot predict whether this trend will continue

nextel mexico s profitability is a result of subscriber growth with increasing average revenues per subscriber and operating costs maintained in line with revenues 
additional subscriber growth was the result of selectively expanding coverage in new markets and improving network quality and capacity  including launching service in baja california and providing voice and data coverage to a busy cross border area between tijuana and san diego 
coverage expansion and network improvements were attributable to capital expenditures totaling million for the year ended december  and a share of all capital expenditure investments that we made during  a trend that we expect will likely continue in the near future 
average revenues per subscriber improved due to the implementation of new rate plans and increased minutes of use in interconnect and dispatch traffic

depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is partially due to an increase in gross property  plant and equipment additions during principally due to the build out of new service areas in peru 
interest expense the million  or  decrease in interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the elimination of interest on nextel peru s portion of the international equipment facility  which it repaid during the third quarter of f

operating revenues and cost of revenues did not significantly change from the year ended december  to the year ended december  because nextel chile s subscriber base remained stable 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a million increase in general corporate costs  which increased due to the following a million increase in outside services specifically for audit  tax and consulting activities during  a million increase in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in corporate personnel  a million increase in stock compensation expense  and a million increase in business insurance expense caused by increased insurance premiums and new business insurance coverage 
interest expense the million  or  decrease in interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily related to the elimination of interest on our senior secured discount notes in connection with the retirement of substantially all of these notes during the first quarter of  as well as a decrease in our interest expense related to our international equipment facility and our brazil equipment facility in connection with the extinguishment of these facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by interest incurred on our convertible notes and our convertible notes during interest income the million  or  decrease in interest income from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower rates on outstanding corporate cash balances compared to loss on early extinguishment of debt the million loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  represents the loss we incurred in connection with the retirement of substantially all of our senior secured discount notes through a cash tender offer in march other expense  net other expense  net  of million for the year ended december  consists primarily of a loss related to accrued interest that we forgave on nextel argentina s credit facilities that the corporate entity repurchased in the fourth quarter of since this accrued interest was due between a corporate entity and a consolidated subsidiary  the forgiveness of accrued interest did not impact our consolidated results of operations 
c 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital surplus of million as of december   a million increase compared to december  the increase in our working capital  which is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities  is primarily attributable to higher consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from the draw down of our million mexico syndicated loan facility in may and million in gross proceeds that we received from the issuance of our convertible notes in august we recognized net income of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during  and  our operating revenues more than offset our operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  and cash capital expenditures 
however  we cannot be sure that this trend will continue in the future as we intend to continue the current expansion of our networks  primarily in mexico and brazil 
see d 
future capital needs and resources for a discussion of our future outlook and anticipated sources and uses of funds for cash flows our operating activities provided us with million of net cash and cash equivalents during  a million increase from our operating activities provided us with million of net cash during  a million increase from both increases were due to the generation of higher operating income resulting from our profitable growth strategy  partially offset by increases in cash used for working capital 
we used million of net cash in our investing activities during  a million increase from cash capital expenditures increased million from million in to million in due to the accelerated build out of our digital mobile networks during we paid million and million in cash for acquisitions and purchases of spectrum licenses in and  respectively 
during  we purchased million of short term investments and received million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments 
we also purchased foreign currency derivative instruments at a net cost of million 
we used million of net cash in our investing activities during  a million increase from cash capital expenditures increased million from million in to million in due to investments made in advance of our planned expansion activities in we paid million and million in cash for acquisitions and purchases of licenses in and  respectively 
during  we purchased million in short term investments of which we received million in proceeds from maturities and sales of these short term investments 
we also purchased a foreign currency derivative instrument at a net cost of million 
we did not make similar purchases of short term investments or foreign currency derivative instruments during our financing activities provided us with million of net cash during  primarily due to the following million in gross proceeds that we raised in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes  million in gross proceeds that we received in connection with the draw down of our mexico syndicated loan facility  and million in proceeds received from stock option exercises by our employees 
these increases were partially offset by million in cash we used to pay debt financing costs in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes 
we used million of net cash in our financing activities during  primarily due to the following million in cash we used to retire substantially all of our senior secured discount notes in connection with our tender offer  million in cash we used to repay our international equipment facility with motorola  and million in cash we used to pay debt financing costs in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes 
these decreases were partially offset by million in gross proceeds that we raised in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes 
our financing activities provided us with million of net cash during  primarily due to million in net proceeds that we received from the sale of common stock  million in proceeds  net of debt financing costs  that we received from our convertible note issuance and million in proceeds that we received from our telecommunication tower sale leaseback financing transactions that closed during  partially offset by million that we used to repay our long term credit facilities with motorola  inc d 
future capital needs and resources capital resources 
our ongoing capital resources depend on a variety of factors  including our existing cash and cash equivalents balances  cash flows generated by our operating companies and external financial sources that may be available 
as of december   our capital resources included million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available short term investments 
our ability to generate sufficient net cash from our operating activities is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate and collect from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  our ability to continue to grow our customer base  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in october  nextel mexico closed on a million  five year syndicated loan facility 
of the total amount of the facility  million is denominated in us dollars  with a floating interest rate based on libor  million is denominated in mexican pesos  with a floating interest rate based on the mexican reference interest rate  tiie  and million is denominated in mexican pesos  at an interest rate fixed at the time of funding 
in april  nextel mexico amended the credit agreement for the syndicated loan facility to extend the availability period until may   and in may  nextel mexico drew down on the loan facility for the entire million 
on june  and june   certain noteholders converted million and million  respectively  principal face amount of our convertible notes into  shares and  shares shares issued per  of debt principal multiplied by the debt principal in accordance with the original terms of the debt agreement 
in connection with these conversions  we paid in the aggregate million in cash as additional consideration  as well as million of accrued interest 
in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which the initial purchaser exercised in full 
as a result  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  resulting in total net proceeds of about million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year  beginning february  the notes will mature on august  unless earlier converted or redeemed by the holders or repurchased by us 
under an existing agreement with american tower corporation  during we received million in gross proceeds from tower sale leaseback transactions in mexico and brazil 
capital needs 
we currently anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for operating expenses relating to our digital mobile networks  capital expenditures to expand and enhance our digital mobile networks  as discussed below under capital expenditures  future spectrum or other related purchases  debt service requirements  including tower financing and capital lease obligations  cash taxes  and other general corporate expenditures 
the following table sets forth the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations determined as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the current terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see item a 
risk factors our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to modify or update the information contained in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total in thousands convertible notes tower financing obligations mexico syndicated loan facility capital lease obligations spectrum fees spectrum acquisition obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual commitments these amounts include estimated principal and interest payments over the full term of the obligation based on our expectations as to future interest rates  assuming the current payment schedule 
these amounts represent principal and interest payments due under our co location agreements to american tower and our existing corporate aircraft lease 
the amounts related to our existing aircraft lease exclude amounts that are contingently due in the event of our default under the lease  but do include remaining amounts due under the letter of credit provided for our new corporate aircraft 
these amounts do not include variable fees based on certain operating revenues and are subject to increases in the mexican consumer pricing index 
these amounts primarily relate to spectrum obligations related to sme licenses in brazil 
these amounts principally include future lease costs related to our transmitter and receiver sites and switches and office facilities as of december  these amounts represent maximum contractual purchase obligations under various agreements with our vendors 
the amounts due in more than five years include our current estimates of asset retirement obligations based on our expectations as to future retirement costs  inflation rates and timing of retirements 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in the future  we expect to finance our capital spending using the most effective combination of cash from operations  cash on hand and any other external financing that becomes available 
our capital spending is driven by several factors  including the expansion of our digital mobile networks to new market areas  the construction of additional transmitter and receiver sites to increase system capacity and maintain system quality and the installation of related switching equipment in some of our existing market coverage areas  the enhancement of our digital mobile network coverage around some major market areas  enhancements to our existing iden technology to increase voice capacity  and non network related information technology projects 
our future capital expenditures will be significantly affected by future technology improvements and technology choices 
in october  motorola and nextel communications announced an anticipated significant technology upgrade to the iden digital mobile network  the voice coder software upgrade 
beginning in  we started selling handsets that can operate on the new voice coder 
we expect that this software upgrade will increase our voice capacity for interconnect calls and leverage our existing investment in infrastructure 
with the exception of mexico  we do not expect to realize the benefits from the operation of the voice coder until after if there are substantial delays in realizing the benefits of the voice coder  we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs 
see item a 
risk factors future outlook 
we believe that our current business plan  which contemplates significant expansions in mexico and brazil  will not require any additional external funding  and we will be able to operate and grow our business while servicing our debt obligations 
our revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that if current foreign currency exchange rates do not significantly adversely change  we will continue to generate net income for the foreseeable future 
see item a 
risk factors in making our assessments of a fully funded business plan and net income  we have considered cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand and available to fund our operations  expected cash flows from operations  the anticipated level of capital expenditures  the anticipated level of spectrum acquisitions  our scheduled debt service  and cash taxes 
if our business plans change  including as a result of changes in technology  or if we decide to expand into new markets or further in our existing markets  as a result of the construction of additional portions of our network or the acquisition of competitors or others  or if economic conditions in any of our markets generally  or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry change materially from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our mobile wireless business  then the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as the conclusions presented herein as to the adequacy of the available sources of cash and timing on our ability to generate net income could change significantly 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources  and could require us to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
in addition  we continue to assess the opportunities to raise additional funding on attractive terms and conditions and at times that do not involve any of these events or circumstances and may do so if the opportunity presents itself 
however  our ability to seek additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that we cannot presently predict with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  and the future market prices of our securities 
e 
effect of inflation and foreign currency exchange our net assets are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in local currencies 
additionally  a substantial portion of our long term debt is denominated entirely in us dollars  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risks 
nextel argentina  nextel brazil and nextel mexico conduct business in countries in which the rate of inflation has historically been significantly higher than that of the united states 
we seek to protect our earnings from inflation and possible currency depreciation by periodically adjusting the local currency prices charged by each operating company for sales of handsets and services to its customers 
we routinely monitor our foreign currency exposure and the cost effectiveness of hedging instruments 
in november  nextel mexico entered into a derivative agreement to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with a portion of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk was hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases for a month period that began in january and ended in december in september and october  nextel mexico entered into derivative agreements to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with a significant portion of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk was hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases for a month period beginning in january inflation is not currently a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
from time to time  we may experience price changes in connection with the purchase of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  but we do not currently believe that any of these price changes will be material to our business 
f 
effect of new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 or sfas  to produce financial reporting that more accurately represents the economics of nonmonetary exchange transactions 
apb opinion no 
 or apb  provided an exception to the basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets 
that exception required that some nonmonetary exchanges  although commercially substantive  be recorded on a carryover basis 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  that requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
previously  as permitted under statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  we recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options  other than certain accelerated vesting options 
however  in accordance with sfas r  pro forma disclosure of share based payment awards as implemented under sfas  is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a for all share based payments granted on or after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the effective adoption date for sfas r is the first annual reporting period for public companies that begins after june  and applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at the company s adoption date 
we adopted sfas r effective january   as required  under the modified prospective method of application 
using the guidance of the modified prospective method we do not expect to adjust our prior period financial statements 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas r in will result in a pre tax charge in the statement of operations to compensation expense of approximately million 
sfas r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
the effect of this change is conditioned on the number and timing of future stock option exercises  and as such  cannot be reasonably estimated 
in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  or fsp r  which provides that companies may elect to use a specified short cut method to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting the accounting requirements of sfas r  which is referred to as the apic pool  assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by sfas the short cut method is available to any company regardless of whether the company adopts sfas r using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application transition method or whether the company has the ability to calculate the apic pool in accordance with the guidance in paragraph of sfas r 
fsp r is effective immediately when a company transitions to the accounting requirements of sfas r 
in accordance with fsp r  we will not determine whether we will elect to use the short cut method to calculate the apic pool until such time that it becomes required 
in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
r  classification of options and similar instruments as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event  or fsp r  to address the classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that are required under sfas r to be classified as liabilities if the entity can be required under any circumstances to settle the option or similar instrument by transferring cash or other assets 
fsp r amends sfas r to allow companies to classify such options as equity if the cash settlement feature can only be exercised upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee s control and is not probable of occurring 
on the date the contingent award becomes probable of occurring  the option or similar instrument should be accounted for as a modification from an equity award to a liability award in accordance with the guidance of sfas r 
the guidance in fsp r should be applied upon the initial adoption of fas r 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  or fin fin clarifies that a conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the time and or method of the settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the statement is effective for companies no later than their first fiscal year ending after december  the adoption of fin resulted in additional asset retirement cost and asset retirement obligations of million and million  respectively  as of december  the cumulative effect of adopting fin was not material  and as such  we recorded million of additional operating expense for accretion and million of additional depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retroactive application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impractical to do so 
sfas will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements except to the extent that it requires retroactive application in circumstances that would previously have been effected in the period of change under apb opinion no 
at the june  emerging issues task force  or eitf  meeting  the eitf discussed issue no 
 the effect of a liquidated damages clause on a freestanding financial instrument subject to eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  or eitf which addresses how a liquidated damages clause payable in cash affects the accounting for a freestanding financial instrument subject to the provisions of eitf issue the eitf discussed a whether a registration rights penalty meets the definition of a derivative and b whether the registration rights agreement and the financial instrument to which it pertains should be considered as a combined instrument or as separate freestanding instruments 
at the september  eitf meeting  the eitf postponed further deliberations on eitf  and the fasb staff requested that the fasb consider a separate derivatives issue guide  or dig  issue that addresses whether a registration rights agreement is a derivative in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
following the resolution of that dig issue  the fasb staff will request that the eitf reconvene deliberations on eitf while eitf remains unresolved  we have determined that the liquidated damage clauses contained in our convertible note agreements have been properly considered and accounted for in accordance with the prevailing guidance 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  or fsp no 
 to address accounting for rental costs associated with building and ground operating leases 
fsp no 
requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
fsp no 
is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  and requires that public companies that are currently capitalizing these rental costs for operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date to cease capitalizing such costs 
retroactive application in accordance with sfas is permitted but not required 
we intend to implement fsp no 
effective january  accordingly  we will begin expensing rental costs incurred under the construction period on january  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas sfas a permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  b clarifies that certain instruments are not subject to the requirements of sfas  c establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that may contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  d clarifies what may be an embedded derivative for certain concentrations of credit risk and e amends sfas to eliminate certain prohibitions related to derivatives on a qualifying special purpose entity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  while a significant portion of our operations are financed in us dollars through our convertible notes and a portion of our syndicated loan facility in mexico 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar expose us to foreign currency exchange risks 
these risks include the impact of translating our local currency reported earnings into us dollars when the us dollar strengthens against the local currencies of our foreign operations 
in addition  nextel mexico  nextel brazil and nextel argentina purchase some capital assets and all handsets in us dollars but record the related revenue generated from these purchases in local currency

we enter into derivative transactions only for hedging or risk management purposes 
we have not and will not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or profit generating purposes 
in november  nextel mexico entered into a hedge agreement to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with a portion of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk was hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases for a month period from january to december under this agreement  nextel mexico purchased us dollar call options and sold call options on the mexican peso

interest rate changes expose our fixed rate long term borrowings to changes in fair value and expose our variable rate long term borrowings to changes in future cash flows 
in july  nextel mexico entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability of future cash flows associated with the million mexican peso denominated variable interest rate portion of its million syndicated loan facility 
under the interest rate swap  nextel mexico agreed to exchange the difference between the variable mexican reference rate  tiie  and a fixed interest rate  based on a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap fixed the amount of interest expense associated with this portion of the mexico syndicated loan facility effective august  and continues over the life of the facility based on a fixed interest rate of about per year 
as of december   a significant portion of our borrowings were fixed rate long term debt obligations
