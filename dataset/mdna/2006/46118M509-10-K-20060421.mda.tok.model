item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a with our overall objective of giving the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business is moving 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for our fiscal year  compared to our and fiscal years 
we then analyze our liquidity and capital resources and discuss relevant recent accounting pronouncements 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
the various sections of this md a contain a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing  and particularly in the risk factors section 
our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations 
overview intraware was founded in and went public in february our goal is to become the de facto standard among digital delivery solution providers 
we are pursuing various strategy objectives to achieve this goal 
first  we are working to become a profitable  cash generating company by growing our subscribenet business and practicing stringent fiscal responsibility 
second  we are seeking to strengthen our technological advantage and extend the breadth of our functionality in the electronic software delivery and management esdm area by further improving our esdm solutions through internal research and development  and through alliances with adjacent technology providers 
third  we are increasing our efforts to reach additional markets outside our existing enterprise software developer customer base 
we intend to leverage our digital delivery expertise and expanded service offering to penetrate new markets and new market segments 
fourth  we seek to continue extending and strengthening our customer base by executing on our sales and marketing plan and by providing exceptional customer service 
we currently see a number of trends in the marketplace that are potentially important for our business 
first  growth in the technology sector has improved over the past two years 
we have benefited from this trend as technology companies experiencing growth have been more willing to invest in technologies that support their own businesses 
however  with this growth have come inflationary pressures on our personnel costs  which is the most significant component of our cost structure 
second  the pace of mergers and acquisitions in the enterprise software sector remains brisk 
these consolidations pose both opportunities and risks for us  potentially leading either to growth in our contracts with those customers if they grow larger  or to cancellation of customer contracts if our customers merge or are acquired by companies that do not use our esdm service 
third  technology companies continue the trend of outsourcing operational functions to reduce costs 
our services enable enterprise software companies to outsource key operational functions in a manner we believe is financially compelling 
therefore  we may benefit from this outsourcing trend 
fourth  the use of hosted web based applications  which in the past has been limited by concerns about speed  reliability and security  continues to gain acceptance among mainstream businesses  largely because of a desire for cost savings 
this trend may benefit us because our subscribenet service is a hosted web based application 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
we also made a number of long term strategic decisions during the past fiscal year 
on january   we terminated our sales alliances agreement with software spectrum  under which intraware provided sales and marketing services of sunone products in conjunction with its subscribenet esdm service 
the sales alliances agreement with software spectrum accounted for all of our alliance and reimbursement revenues  a significant portion of our online services and technology revenues  and more than of our total revenues in our fiscal year 
we have signed a two year subscribenet service agreement with fusionstorm to provide esdm services for their sunone product sales  which we expect will partially offset the decline in our online services and technology revenues 
the company does not expect to offer similar sales and marketing services in the future to other customers as part of the subscribenet service  and therefore sold its rights to the underlying sunone customer list to fusionstorm for  fusionstorm will be required to pay us an additional  if gross profit from sales of certain sun microsystems software exceeds pre established targets during the months following completion of the asset sale 
effective january   we will no longer recognize any alliance and reimbursement revenues 
in addition  on november  we entered into a series b preferred stock purchase agreement with digital river  inc  under which digital river purchased  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into one million shares of common stock 
proceeds from the transaction were approximately million  net of investment banking and legal fees 
our agreement with digital river also provides that  after the execution of a strategic alliance agreement between us and digital river and until digital river owns less than of our outstanding voting stock  digital river will be entitled to designate a member of our board of directors 
our sale of preferred shares to digital river significantly bolstered our cash balances  but we also believe our relationship with digital river offers strategic opportunities for both companies 
digital river is a well respected provider of online e commerce services  or store fronts  for vendors who sell their products on the internet  particularly vendors of consumer software 
intraware  by contrast  has particular strength in delivering software electronically to the enterprise software market 
we are in negotiations with digital river to implement an alliance agreement under which we would offer digital river s e commerce services with our subscribnet service  and digital river would offer our subscribenet service with its e commerce product 
we believe this alliance agreement could help further expand our electronic delivery service into the consumer software market  where digital river has a much larger presence than we do  while at the same time enabling us to offer e commerce services to our existing installed base and to other prospective customers in the enterprise software market 
it is important to note  however  that we have not concluded our negotiations with digital river regarding the alliance agreement  and that our negotiations could prove unsuccessful 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
we earn revenues and generate cash principally through recurring service fees charged for our subscribenet service  and professional services fees charged for customization of our subscribenet service 
principal sources of revenue and cash also included  until august   cost reimbursement received for our sales and marketing services provided to software spectrum and  until january   our profit sharing with software spectrum 
historically  we also have raised substantial amounts of cash through private stock placements 
we have incurred losses and negative cash flow from operations during each fiscal year since our inception 
for fiscal  we narrowed our net losses to approximately million  and reduced our negative cash flows from operations from the prior year to million 
despite our improvements  we continued to experience recurring losses and negative cash flows 
we believe that the effects of our capital financings to date  our past and current strategic actions to improve revenue  and our ongoing cost controls  will generate sufficient cash resources to fund our future operations 
however  if we fail to adequately increase our revenues or control spending  our business could suffer material adverse effects 
the preceding paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
at our annual meeting of stockholders on september   our stockholders authorized our board of directors to effect a one for ten reverse split of our common stock 
on september   we filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the delaware secretary of state to effect the reverse stock split 
the reverse stock split became effective at the close of business on september  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity  we will need to add significant numbers of customers and end users to our service 
as a result of this anticipated growth we will incur increased personnel costs and costs associated with upgrading and expanding our infrastructure at various stages to meet the needs of our customers 
the timing of these expenses could place negative pressure on our gross profit margins and earnings 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future revenues 
to the extent that our competitors successfully introduce products or services with higher market acceptance  our revenues would be negatively affected 
if revenues are lower than expected due to lower customer growth or losses in key customers  we may experience difficulty in adjusting expense levels in a timely manner 
to meet emerging market needs we may also acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies to further strengthen our technology 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
we also face a number of key risks that are not discussed in this md a  which are described in more detail in the risk factors section in item a 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  costs of deferred revenue  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  and income taxes to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we have provided the service to the customer  made the software available for customer download through our website  or shipped the software to the customer  we believe that collection of these fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our online services and technology revenue results primarily from three types of arrangements 
first  it results from sales of our subscribenet digital delivery service to software vendors and other companies distributing software as part of their business 
second  it results from professional services that we provide to customize our subscribenet service for customers  to convert data for customers  and to integrate our proprietary software 
third  it results from our resale of third party services or licenses complementary to our subscribenet service  one of which is e commerce 
in addition  if appropriate opportunities present themselves in the future  we may generate online services and technology revenue from the sale of our proprietary software licenses and related maintenance to companies using those products internally or using those products to provide web based services to their customers 
as a result of the sale of our asset management software business in may  we are not currently deriving revenue from licenses  maintenance or integration services for our proprietary software 
alliance and reimbursement revenue primarily relates to our recently terminated alliance agreement with software spectrum  under which we earned fees for providing sales and marketing services of sunone products  in addition to fees for our subscribenet esdm services the sales fees we earned under the agreement consisted of a percentage of the gross profit derived from software spectrum s sales of the third party software and maintenance for which we provided sales and marketing services  and  prior to august   reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to providing sales and marketing services to software spectrum for that third party software and maintenance 
this revenue was recognized as we provided the services to software spectrum 
on august   we signed an updated agreement with software spectrum 
under the updated agreement  software spectrum paid us a higher percentage of the gross profit derived from its sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
however  software spectrum stopped reimbursing us for our direct costs in maintaining a team dedicated to sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
we terminated our alliance agreement with software spectrum effective january  and ceased recognizing alliance and reimbursement revenue on that date 
we defer online services and technology revenues related to our subscribenet digital delivery service and generally recognize them ratably over the term of the service arrangement 
the typical subscription term is one year  although some may be shorter or extend up to approximately years 
our customer contracts are generally noncancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
a majority of our subscribenet service implementations for new customers involve customization essential to the functionality of the service 
in those cases  we defer revenue recognition until the service go live date is reached  and then recognize the revenue on a ratable basis over the remaining contract term 
the go live date is the later of the date on which the essential functionality is delivered or the point at which no additional customization is required as part of the implementation 
our subscribenet contracts with customers typically give the customer a period of time generally five days to evaluate a subscribenet implementation after we have completed it  and provide that the customer is deemed to have accepted the implementation if it has not affirmatively rejected it within that period 
we typically rely on such non rejections by customers to indicate their acceptance of implementations 
any subsequent indications by our customers that their implementations have not been properly completed could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we also sell additional professional services related to subscribenet agreements 
generally  these services do not provide stand alone value to a customer  and accordingly  we defer recognition of that revenue until the go live date for the professional services  similar to the manner in which we treat subscribenet service revenues as discussed above 
such professional services revenues are recognized ratably over the longer of the remaining estimated customer life or the remaining contract term  commencing with the completion of the professional services 
estimated customer life requires that we periodically estimate the projected life of our existing customers  based on historical information  such as customer renewal and termination rates 
our estimated customer life has increased over time due to relatively high customer retention rates 
we expect the projected customer life to continue to increase as customers lengthen and renew their service agreements 
a increase in our estimated customer life during our fiscal year ended february   would have caused a net increase in our net loss of approximately  online services and technology revenues related to our resale of third party services or software licenses complementary to our subscribenet service were generally recognized as the service was provided 
if the service or license resold involved customization essential to the functionality of the underlying subscribenet service  the fees charged for the customization were recognized as revenue in the same manner in which we treat the professional services discussed above 
resold services or licenses were recognized as revenue based on the gross fee charged to the customer  since we bore the credit risk for resold services or licenses  had the latitude to establish pricing at our discretion  and were primarily responsible for acceptability of the services or licenses delivered 
in addition  costs paid to the third party providers were recorded as cost of revenues and recognized in the same manner as the related revenue 
as mentioned above  a determination that the collection of fees is reasonably assured is a precursor to recognizing revenue 
determination of collectability of payments requires judgment on the part of management and includes periodically evaluating customers credit worthiness see allowance for doubtful accounts below 
deferred costs we capitalize direct costs of revenues related to significant subscribenet service implementations and established professional services contracts associated with our subscribenet services 
direct costs include compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to the time spent on significant implementation and professional services activities 
these costs are recognized over the longer of the remaining estimated customer life or the remaining contract term see revenue recognition above 
costs associated with professional services involving significant new functionality for the subscribenet service that are partially or fully funded by customers but do not qualify as funded research and development activities are expensed as cost of revenues as incurred until a working model is delivered to the customer 
once a working model has been delivered  all additional direct costs are capitalized in the same manner discussed above 
any change in our revenue recognition estimates could result in corresponding changes to our recognition of costs of deferred revenues 
a increase in our estimated customer life during our fiscal year ended february   would have caused a net increase in our net loss of approximately  at february   we had approximately million in capitalized costs relating to deferred revenues 
we expense customer acquisition costs  including sales commissions  as incurred 
we also deferred legal costs incurred in connection with patent applications 
as of february  we had million in deferred legal costs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation for our employees using the intrinsic value method presented in accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure amendment of sfas no 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  as of the date of the grant  between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price 
for our fiscal year ended february   no stock based compensation was recorded for stock options granted to our employees because the exercise price of all stock options granted to our employees was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
the standard requires companies to value employee stock options and stock issued under employee stock purchase plans using the fair value based method on the grant date and record stock based compensation expense 
the fair value based models that companies are allowed to use can be different from the black scholes option pricing model  which we currently use to calculate the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied sfas no 
to employee option grants 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements shows what the pro forma net loss and loss per share for the fiscal years ended february  and february   would have been if we had applied sfas no 
r 
however  the actual impact to our results of operations upon adoption of the standard could materially differ from the pro forma information included in note to our audited consolidated financial statements due to differences in the option pricing model used  estimates and assumptions required  and options to be included in the calculation upon adoption 
the fair value based models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock options 
in april  the sec issued a release which amends the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
accordingly  we will be required to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending february  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and loss per share 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our inability to collect required payments from our customers 
when evaluating the adequacy of this allowance  we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customers payment history 
we may need to record increases to our allowance balances in the future 
at february   we had many accounts receivable balances 
any dispute  early contract termination or other collection issue related to these receivable balances could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operations 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing our financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
given that we have incurred losses since inception and therefore have not been required to pay income taxes  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at february  in the event that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period that this is determined 
results of operations total revenue the following table sets forth the revenue  changes in revenue and percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended february  february  february  total change of revenue total change of revenue total of revenue revenues online services and technology    alliance and reimbursement    related party online services and technology software product sales total revenues  revenues for combined online services and technology for the year ended february   increased from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to a net increase of approximately million in revenue from subscribenet customers 
there was an increase in revenues of approximately million from customers whose go live date was late in our fiscal year ended february   an increase of million related to new agreements that resulted in higher contract values for existing customers and million of the increase was due to new customers obtained in our fiscal year ended february  there was also an increase in revenues of million related to e commerce services 
revenues for related party online service and technology revenue for the year ended february  decreased from the prior year due to the termination of the strategic alliance agreement with zomax  inc the increase in combined online services and technology revenue for the year ended february   as compared to the year ended february   was primarily due to a net increase of approximately million in revenue primarily recognized from five of our existing customers 
we expect our combined online services and technology revenue in our first quarter of fiscal year to be approximately the same as those in our fiscal quarter ended february  the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
alliance and reimbursement revenue relates to our alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales of sun software licenses and maintenance  which we terminated january  this revenue consisted of a percentage of the gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services  and reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun software for software spectrum 
the decrease in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   was primarily due to software spectrum no longer reimbursing us for our direct costs in maintaining a team dedicated to sales of sun software licenses and maintenance and our termination of our alliance agreement with software spectrum 
the decrease in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   was primarily due to a reduction of the shared gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services of million 
we do not expect to recognize any alliance and reimbursement revenues for our fiscal year ending february  see risk factors in item a 
the decline in software product revenue for the years ended february  and february   was due to our transition out of the business of reselling third party software products and related maintenance 
we do not expect to recognize future revenues from our former third party resale activities 
however  we may recognize future revenues from products and services complementary to our subscribenet service  which originate with other companies and are sold to customers through us as part of a comprehensive esdm business solution 
the previous two sentences are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended february  february  february  total change of revenue total change of revenue total of revenue total cost of revenues  gross profit  operating expenses sales and marketing    product development     general and administrative    restructuring gain loss on disposal of assets total operating expenses  cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased to million for fiscal  but remained at approximately million for fiscal years and our gross margin decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal  and for fiscal the gross margin decrease for the years ended february  and february   respectively  primarily reflects the decrease we have experienced in our alliance and reimbursement revenues  as described above 
the decrease also resulted from growing professional service sales and sales of third party product and services related to subscribenet for the year ended february   which generally carry lower gross profit margins 
cost of revenues primarily consists of certain allocated costs related to our internet connectivity  assets supporting cost of revenues  and customer support  as well as the costs we formerly incurred in maintaining our team dedicated to helping software spectrum sell sun and websense software 
cost of revenues also consists of professional services personnel costs and the cost of third party products sold 
we expect both total cost of revenues and gross profit margin percentages related to online services and technologies for the next fiscal year to be higher than our fiscal year total cost of revenues is expected to be lower and total gross margins are expected to be higher  due to the elimination of costs associated with alliance and reimbursement revenues as of january the preceding paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the actual mix of sales transactions and the timing of the transactions may cause our cost of revenues and gross profit margins to fluctuate materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  advertising  promotional materials and trade show expenses 
the decrease in our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february   compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to a decrease of approximately million related to marketing and advertising  which was part of our planned decrease in sales and marketing expenditures 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february   compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to an increase of approximately million in outside services related to marketing and advertising  which were part of our planned increase in sales and marketing expenditures 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in payroll related expenses of approximately million 
we plan to increase our sales and marketing expenses in our fiscal year ending february   as compared with our fiscal year ended february  the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated  particularly in light of our ongoing strategic review of our product and marketing direction 
we cannot give assurance that any new efforts to improve our marketing will result in additional sales or revenues 
product development expenses product development expenses primarily consist of personnel  consulting  software and related maintenance  equipment depreciation expense and allocated overhead costs 
costs related to research  design and development of products and services have been charged to product development expense as incurred 
the decrease in our product development expenses for the year ended february   compared to those for the year ended february   is due primarily to a decrease in our internal efforts on product development activities of approximately million 
during the year ended february   the product development teams temporarily increased their focus on cost of revenues activities  as described in cost of revenues above 
the decrease in our product development expenses for the year ended february   compared to those for the year ended february   is due primarily to a decrease in software and equipment depreciation expense of approximately million  as many fixed assets had become fully depreciated during the year 
the decrease is also due to a one time expense of approximately million related to lease buyouts that occurred during the fiscal year ended february  we anticipate continuing to invest in additional functionality for our subscribenet service and underlying proprietary software 
however  we expect those investments to fluctuate over time  and expect our product development expenses to fluctuate accordingly 
we expect total product development expenditures to increase in our fiscal year ending february  the previous sentences are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
we cannot give assurance that our product development efforts will result in new or improved products  features or functionality or that the market will accept the improvements to existing or new products  features or functionality developed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive personnel  fees for professional services  uncollectible account activity and certain allocated overhead costs 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   remained consistent with the prior year balances 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   is primarily due to an increase of approximately million in outside consulting services and temporary costs associated with preparation for evaluation of our internal controls to enable management to report on our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we recognized a reduced recovery of million for accounts receivable previously written off 
we expect total general and administrative expenses to increase in our fiscal year ending february  the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
restructuring expenses restructuring expense for the year ended february   was related to severance payments of  made to employees who were terminated in connection with our sale of our sun software resale activities to fusionstorm 
we based the severance payments on the seniority of the respective employees and their stock options holdings 
restructuring expense for the year ended february   was related to a payroll tax refund for overpaid payroll taxes of approximately  these overpaid payroll taxes related to supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for involuntarily terminated employees during our restructuring events in december  august and may gain loss on disposal of assets for the years ended february  and february   we recognized a gain loss of  and  on the disposal of assets  respectively 
for the year ended february   there was a gain of  related to the sale of our sun software resale activities to fusionstorm 
interest expense for the year ended february   interest expense was million  this is consistent with the million for the year ended february   and a decrease from million for the year ended february  interest expense primarily relates to obligations under capital leases and notes payable 
interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   interest and other income and expenses  net was a million credit  an increase from the million credits for the years ended february  and ended february  interest and other income and expenses  net  primarily relates to interest earned on our investment balances 
the increase in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily the result of increased investment balances due to our november  issuance of series b convertible preferred stock  a sustained cash balance from the prior year  and an increase in the interest rates in the current year 
the increase in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily the result of increased rate of return on our cash balances from the prior year 
income taxes as of february   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  which expire in varying amounts between fiscal year and the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain circumstances where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
because of cumulative ownership changes in the past  the federal and state loss carryforwards have been reduced by the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that will expire 
because of these cumulative ownership changes  federal loss carry forwards totaling approximately million and state loss carry forwards totaling approximately million are subject to limitation 
at february   million and million of federal and state net operating losses  respectively  are available without limitation to offset future taxable income 
should there be a change of ownership in the future  the available net operating losses may be further limited 
based upon our limited operating history and losses incurred to date  management does not believe the realization of the related deferred tax assets meets the recognition criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles  and accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to zero 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents our liquidity position at the end of our fiscal years and in thousands for the years ended february  february  cash and cash equivalents   working capital   net cash used in operating activities   net cash provided by financing activities  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended february   we used million in cash to support our operations  down from million used in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower operating expenses during the year ended february  our overall net cash used in operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss for the year and the timing of our payments to vendors and receipts from customers 
the majority of our operating costs continue to relate to employee payroll and related expenditures 
the net cash used in operations primarily came from our existing cash and cash equivalents  and partially from the proceeds we received upon the exercise of stock options and sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect to continue to improve our cash used in operations by increasing our billings to customers as more end users are added to our subscribenet service 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement that is subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated see risk factors in item a 
our ability to improve our uses of cash and generate positive cash flows in future periods will largely depend on our ability to increase the number of customers of our subscribenet service while increasing existing subscriptions through strong contract renewals 
our net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended february  this primarily resulted from the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock to digital river  netting proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we made draws on our existing equipment advance agreement of approximately million see below 
the proceeds from these stock issuances were offset by payments on our notes payable of approximately million see below 
as of february   we have an agreement with silicon valley bank under which we have three equipment advances outstanding 
the equipment advances bear annual interest rates of the greater of in excess of the bank s prime rate at february  or  and  respectively  and are payable in fixed monthly installments through september  and december  respectively 
at february   the interest rate for our equipment advances was 
under the agreement for the equipment advances  all borrowings are collateralized by a senior security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the agreement also requires us to comply with financial covenants  with which we complied as of february  the agreement further restricts us from incurring or assuming additional indebtedness outside of these equipment advances  excluding trade payables and certain other liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business 
our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended february   included million for our purchase of fixed assets 
we originally paid for these equipment purchases from our cash and cash equivalents  but later drew down million under the above mentioned equipment advance agreements to partially finance these purchases 
we used these fixed asset purchases primarily to upgrade and expand our subscribenet infrastructure and corporate information systems 
we expect to continue to use and renew our equipment advances to finance additional fixed asset purchases 
the preceding paragraph contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and financing arrangements for the foreseeable future 
however  if our subscribenet business fails to grow significantly or declines from its current level  we could be forced to seek additional capital to fund our operations 
at february   we had no other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise had we engaged in such relationships 
the following table summarizes our debt and lease obligations at february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
this table provides information through our year ending february   as we do not have any debt or lease obligations beyond that point 
payments due by period total less than year years a long term debt b operating leases  a includes payments from march  through february  b includes approximately  in interest 
as of february   our series a and series b redeemable convertible preferred stock entitled its holders to liquidation preferences of a minimum of million and million or  if greater  the market price of the common stock into which the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible  respectively  in the event of our liquidation

all of our sales are in united states dollars 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents portfolio 
the effect of changes in interest rates of over a six month horizon would not have a material effect on the fair value of the portfolio 
any declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
