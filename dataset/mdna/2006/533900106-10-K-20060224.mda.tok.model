accounting for stock based compensation 
all employee stock option grants beginning january  are expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
prior to  the company applied the intrinsic value method permitted under sfas no 
 as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  in accounting for the company s stock option plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized in years prior to the stock plan as amended in may  provides for the granting of options  tandem appreciation rights tars  restricted shares and deferred shares up to an aggregate of  of the company s common shares 
tandem appreciation rights are granted concurrently with options  and represent the right  exercisable by surrender of the underlying option  to receive in cash  an amount equal to the increase in market value from the grant price of the company s common shares 
tars payable in cash require the recording of a liability and related compensation expense to be measured by the difference between the quoted market price of the number of common shares covered by the grant and the option price per common share at grant date 
any increases or decreases in the market price of the common shares between grant date and exercise date result in changes to the company s compensation expense 
compensation expense is accrued over the vesting period 
in addition  changes in the market price of common shares after the vesting period  but prior to the exercise date  require changes in compensation expense 
during  the company modified existing tars by eliminating the cash settlement feature 
this modification required that the tars be accounted for as equity awards 
the associated liability for compensation expense recognized prior to the date of modification of  was reclassified from other non current liabilities to additional paid in capital 
the unrecognized compensation cost  equal to the difference between the fair value of the tars on the date of the modification and compensation cost previously recognized  will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the tars 
tars payable in common shares will be accounted for as stock options and the fair value method of accounting under sfas no 
will be utilized 
subsequent changes in share values will not affect compensation expense 
during   tars were issued 
there were no tars issued during restricted shares and deferred shares require compensation expense to be measured by the quoted market price on the grant date 
expense is recognized by allocating the aggregate fair value at grant date over the vesting period 
no expense is recognized for any shares ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet the vesting requirements 
the company issued  restricted shares at a market price of per share in there were no restricted shares issued in and no deferred shares were issued during or the company issued  shares of common stock from treasury upon exercise of employee stock options during the effect of all stock based awards decreased earnings per share by approximately and in and  respectively 
stock based awards were immaterial to earnings per share in product liability expense product liability expenses have been increasing  particularly with respect to the increased number of welding fume claims 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
net expenditures on product liability increased approximately  in compared to these net expenditures are not expected to increase materially in compared to see note n 
the long term impact of the welding fume loss contingency  in the aggregate  on operating cash flows and capital markets access is difficult to assess  particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co defendants and insurance carriers 
moreover  the company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial 
if cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason  or the company s trial experience changes overall  it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could reduce the company s operating results and cash flow and restrict capital market access 
off balance sheet financial instruments the company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the company s credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit at december  were immaterial 
the company has also provided a guarantee on a loan for a joint venture of  at december  the company believes the likelihood is remote that material payment will be required under this arrangement because of the current financial condition of the joint venture

generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
under sfas no 
r  public companies would have been required to implement the standard as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule amending the compliance dates of sfas no 
r to allow companies to implement sfas no

the adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as a result of the company adopting fair value accounting under sfas no 
on january  critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used 
if warranted  these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated 
historically  the company s estimates have been determined to be reasonable 
no material changes to the company s accounting policies were made in the company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
legal and tax contingencies the company  like other manufacturers  is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims and litigation include  without limitation  product liability claims and health  safety and environmental claims  some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese induced illnesses 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and  where reimbursements are probable  they are recognized in the applicable period 
with respect to costs other than defense costs ie  for liability and or settlement or other resolution  reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs  after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience 
if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable  or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation 
many of the current cases are in preliminary procedural stages and insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 
reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change 
moreover  reserves only cover identified and or asserted claims 
future claims could  therefore  give rise to increases to such reserves 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section of this annual report on form k for further discussion of legal contingencies 
the company is subject to taxation from us federal  state  municipal and international jurisdictions 
the calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment 
the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published 
the company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation 
exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures  however  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries which are deemed permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings 
at december   the company had approximately  of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which may reduce taxable income in future years 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
at december   a valuation allowance of  had been recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes 
pensions the company and its subsidiaries maintain a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees in the us  as well as employees outside the us these plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa  local statutory law or as determined by the board of directors 
the plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation 
pension plans are funded except for a domestic non qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans 
the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the market related value of plan assets could be determined by either fair value or a calculated value recognizing changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 
the method chosen must be applied consistently year to year 
the company used fair values at december for the market related value of plan assets 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan s portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets 
the asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance  as well as  current market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and equity market performance 
the company determined this rate to be for its us plans at december  and  respectively 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan 
the amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense 
during  investment returns in the company s us pension plans were approximately compared to in a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately  another significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for plan liabilities by referring to investment yields available on long term bonds rated aa or better 
the company also considers the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non callable bonds rated aa or better 
the company determined this rate to be and for its us plans at december  and  respectively 
a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately  the company made voluntary contributions to its us defined benefit plans of   and  in  and  respectively 
based on current pension funding rules  the company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans will be required in the company expects to voluntarily contribute  in pension expense relating to the company s defined benefit plans was   and  in  and  respectively 
the company expects pension expense to decline by approximately  inventories and reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for domestic inventories  cost is determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  and for non us inventories  cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the excess of current cost over lifo cost amounted to  at december  the company reviews the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  write downs of inventory values and adjustments to cost of sales may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
accounts receivable and allowances the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered 
the company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable  knowledge of the financial condition of customers  review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future  additional allowances may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows and established business valuation multiples 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization as required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of reporting units is determined using models developed by the company which incorporate estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates  established business valuation multiples  and management judgments regarding the applicable discount rates to value those estimated cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the december  foreign currency rates  a change in commodity prices  and a basis point increase in effective interest rates under the company s current borrowing arrangements 
the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at december  were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange  commodity price  or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes  interest expense  or accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability 
foreign currency exchange risk the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
at december   the company hedged third party and intercompany purchases and sales 
at december   the company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately  at december   a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
at december   the company also had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately  which hedged intercompany loans 
any loss resulting from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would be offset by the associated gain on the underlying intercompany loan receivable and would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
commodity price risk from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
interest rate risk the company uses floating rate swaps to convert a portion of its  fixed rate  long term borrowings into short term variable interest rates 
an increase in interest expense resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in the december  floating rate would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
see discussion in item  liquidity long term debt 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   approximated carrying value due to their short term duration 
these financial instruments are also subject to concentrations of credit risk 
the company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with major banks and financial institutions and investing in several high quality instruments 
the company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations
