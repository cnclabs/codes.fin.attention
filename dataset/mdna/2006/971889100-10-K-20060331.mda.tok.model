the real estate business consists of residential and commercial properties in arizona  florida  georgia  new jersey and texas 
within this portfolio of properties  certain properties have been designated as being held for sale and have been classified as discontinued operations 
discontinued operations contain properties that may have excellent cash flow or valuation characteristics but that may be positioned for sale at an optimal valuation or may not be in a geographic region that is currently being targeted by the company 
the following discussion takes an income statement approach and discusses the results of operations first for the properties comprising continuing operations and then discusses the discontinued operations 
the assets comprising wilshire s oil and gas business were sold in april  effective march  oil and gas operations for all periods presented in this report have been classified as discontinued operations 
all three activities are reviewed and analyzed in the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in item of this form k 
certain statements in this discussion may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements reflect wilshire s current expectations regarding future results of operations  economic performance  financial condition and achievements of wilshire  and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
wilshire has tried  wherever possible  to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or words of similar meaning 
although wilshire believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such factors include  but are not limited to the risks described in item a of this annual report 
certain data as of december  and for the year then ended  for each of the quarters in and for the first three quarters of have been restated 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such restatements are reflected in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies pursuant to the securities and exchange commission sec disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies  the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
wilshire s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon wilshire s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires wilshire to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
wilshire bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of property and equipment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
management does not believe at december  and that the value of any of its properties is impaired 
revenue recognition revenue from real estate properties is recognized during the period in which the premises are occupied and rent is due from tenants 
for commercial properties  rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in accounts receivable 
for residential properties where lease agreements are almost exclusively for one year terms  rental revenue is recognized in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying leases 
the company follows a policy of aggressively pursuing its rental tenants to ensure timely payment of amounts due 
when a tenant becomes days in arrears on paying rent  the amount is written off and turned over to a collection agency for action 
accordingly  no allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained for the company s real estate tenants 
foreign operations the assets and liabilities of wilshire s canadian subsidiary have been translated at year end exchange rates 
the related revenues and expenses have been translated at average annual exchange rates 
the aggregate effect of translation losses is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying foreign investment at which time gains and losses are included in the company s results of operations 
as a result of the sale of the canadian oil and gas assets in and the anticipated distribution of net proceeds to the united states parent company in  wilshire has provided at december   million of united states taxes and  of canadian taxes that are expected to be incurred upon such remittance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has an investment in the common stock of one publicly traded real estate company in the united states in which the company has exposure to the risk of market value fluctuation 
the company accounts for this investment as securities that are available for sale and marks them to market at each period end 
the change in value in the investment  net of tax impact  is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company also evaluates its investment to determine if it has suffered a decline in market value that is permanent  which would require a charge to the statement of income 
at december   in the opinion of management  there has been no permanent decline in value in the company s holdings of equity securities 
after the sale of its canadian oil and gas assets  the company has cash and cash equivalents at its canadian subsidiary whose value is exposed to fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
the change in value in the canadian dollar denominated accounts is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company will be repatriating all assets  net of liabilities  of its canadian subsidiary during long term debt as of december  and december  consists of the following mortgage notes payable note payable total debt less current portion long term portion includes debt associated with discontinued operations of  in and  in includes debt associated with discontinued operations of  in and  in the aggregate maturities of the long term debt in each of the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter are year amount thereafter at december   the company had  of mortgage debt and notes outstanding which all bear interest at an average fixed rate of and an average remaining life of approximately years 
the fixed rate mortgages and notes are subject to repayment amortization schedules that are longer than the term of the mortgages 
as such  the approximate amount of balloon payments for all mortgage debt and notes that will be required is as follows year amount wilshire expects to re finance the individual mortgages and notes with new mortgages and notes when their terms expire 
to this extent  we have exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed rate mortgage debt and note obligations 
if interest rates  at the time any individual debt instrument is due  are higher than the current fixed interest rate  higher debt service may be required  and or re financing proceeds may be less than the amount of mortgage debt or notes being retired 
we believe that the values of our properties will be adequate to command re financing proceeds equal to  or higher than  the mortgage debt to be re financed 
this expectation represents a forward looking statement 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s forward looking statement include economic conditions in the markets where such properties are located and the level of market interest rates at the time the company is seeking to re finance the properties
