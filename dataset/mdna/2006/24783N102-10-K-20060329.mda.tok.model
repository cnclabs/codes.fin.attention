overview we are a leading provider of integrated voip telephony services  products  hosted solutions  and infrastructure 
we were founded in to capitalize on the growth of the internet as a communications tool by commercially offering ip telephony services 
while we began as primarily a low cost alternative source of wholesale minutes for carriers around the world  we have evolved into one of the premier providers of next generation communication services in the world 
today we support hundreds of thousands of active users around the globe through our two primary distribution channels our service provider and reseller channel and our iconnecthere  or ich  direct to consumer channel 
we offer a broad suite of private label voip products and services as well as a back office platform for service providers  resellers  and corporate customers 
based on our customizable voip solutions  these customers can offer private label telecommunications to their own customer bases  under either their own brand name  a white label brand  and or our iconnecthere or deltathree brand name 
at the same time  iconnecthere  our direct to consumer offering  provides award winning voip products directly to consumers and small businesses online using the same primary platform 
in  we remained focused on increasing the market penetration of our core voip solutions and on continuing to diversify and expand our customer base 
as a result  we continued to sell an increasing diverse set of voip products and services to our growing service provider and reseller base 
we also focused on enhancing our service delivery offering suite by successfully launching a turnkey voip solution for medium size cable and internet service providers  and we added new features to our voip products  launched new distribution lines for our consumer group  and upgraded our network capacity 
going forward  we expect to continue to devote a significant amount of our resources to develop and expand our service provider and reseller base and we expect our revenue from this key channel to represent a growing percentage of our total revenue over the next several years 
we are actively marketing our products and services to a large number of broadband operators  including telecom  cable companies  internet service providers  and consumer oriented retailers around the world 
we believe these companies may prefer to buy our offerings instead of building their own internally developed voip service 
trends in our industry and business a number of factors in our industry and business have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
these trends include overall economic factors our operations and earnings are affected by local  regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for telecommunications products and services 
these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include  among other things  general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions  changes in demographics  including population growth rates and consumer preferences 
our strategy and execution focus is predicated on an assumption that these factors will continue to promote strong desire for the utilization of telephony products and services and that the cost and feature advantages of voip alternatives will not be negatively impacted by unforeseen changes in these factors 
industry the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
in recent years we have seen new sources of supply for our underlying infrastructure that have reduced our overall costs of operation  including both advances in telecommunications technology and advances in technology relating to telecommunications usage  and have enjoyed the benefits of competition among these suppliers for a relatively limited amount of viable customers 
these decreases were driven largely by reduced vendor pricing associated with our increased purchasing power and  to a lesser extent  cost savings associated with an increasing portion of calls between users of our own services  which have no termination costs associated with them 
a key component of our competitive position  particularly given the number and range of competing communications products  is our ability to manage operating expenses successfully  which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 
consumer demand there is significant competition within the traditional telecommunications marketplaces landline and wireless and also with other emergent next generation telecommunications providers  including ip telecommunications providers  in supplying the overall telecommunications needs of businesses and individual consumers  and several of the larger traditional telecommunications companies have announced intentions to merge  which will create even larger competitors 
we compete with other telecommunications firms in the sale and purchase of various products and services in many national and international markets and employ all methods of competition that are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 
a key component of our competitive position  particularly given the commodity based nature of many of our products  is our ability to sell to a growing demand base for alternative communications products  in both the developed and developing global marketplace 
within the developed global marketplace  our ability to sell broadband voip telephony products and services is directly linked to the significant growth rate of broadband adoption  and we expect this trend to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
within the developing areas of the world  our ability to sell alternative telephony products and services is linked to both the increasing baseline economic trends within these countries as well as the growing desire for individuals and businesses to communicate and do business outside of their own countries 
we expect these trends to continue  and benefit from them because both the ability to afford long distance calls and the desire to make them increases as a result 
political factors our operations and earnings have been  and may in the future be  affected from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations  such as forced divestiture of assets  restrictions on production  imports and exports  war or other international conflicts  civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities  price controls  tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation of property  cancellation of contract rights  and telecommunications regulations 
both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
at the same time  voip is becoming legal in more countries as governments seek to increase competition  and this affects us in a positive manner as service providers and resellers seek to meet their customers telecommunications needs with newly available solutions 
both the likelihood of voip legalization and its overall effect upon us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
regulatory factor our business has developed in an environment largely free from regulation 
however  the united states and other countries have begun to examine how voip services should be regulated  and a number of initiatives could have an impact on our business 
these initiatives include the assertion of state regulatory and taxing authorities over us  fcc rulemaking regarding emergency calling services  calea  and electronic privacy  and proposed reforms for the inter carrier compensation system 
complying with regulatory developments will impact our business by increasing our operating expenses  including legal fees  requiring us to make significant capital expenditures or increasing the taxes and regulatory fees we pay 
we may impose additional fees on our customers in response to these increased expenses 
this would have the effect of increasing our revenues per customer  but not our profitability  and increasing the cost of our services to our customers  which would have the effect of decreasing any price advantage we may have 
project factors in addition to the factors cited above  the advancement  cost and results of particular projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with potential partners  governments  suppliers  customers or others  changes in operating conditions or costs  and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties or enhancements 
the likelihood of these items occurring and its overall positive or negative effect upon us vary greatly from project to project and are not predictable 
risk factors see risk factors for a discussion of the impact of market risks  financial risks and other uncertainties 
revenues our revenues are derived from resellers  service providers  and end users of our voip telephony products and services  including pc to phone  and broadband phone 
all revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed 
the provision of voip telephony products and services through our service provider and reseller sales efforts including sales of our outsourced platform solution accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively  while the provision of voip telephony primarily pc to phone through iconnecthere accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
costs and operating expenses costs and operating expenses consist of cost of revenues  research and development expenses  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expense  depreciation and amortization of goodwill  non cash stock compensation  write down of fixed assets  expenses due to cancellation of agreement with a supplier and impairment of goodwill related expenses 
o cost of revenues consist primarily of access  termination and transmission costs paid to carriers that we incur when providing services and fixed costs associated with leased transmission lines 
the term of our contracts for leased transmission lines is generally one year or less  and either party can terminate with prior notice 
o research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with establishing our network and the initial testing of our services and compensation expenses of software developers involved in new product development and software maintenance 
in the future  these expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue depending on the project undertaken during the reporting period 
since our inception  we have expensed all research and development costs in each of the periods in which they were incurred 
o selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with our direct sales force incurred to attract potential service provider  reseller  and corporate customers and advertising and promotional expenses incurred to attract potential consumer users of iconnecthere 
we anticipate that as we add new paid users we will be able to spread these costs over a larger revenue base and accordingly improve our operating margins 
o general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for management  finance and administrative personnel  occupancy costs and legal and accounting fees  as well as the expenses associated with being a public company  including the costs of directors and officers insurance 
we have not recorded any income tax benefit for net losses and credits incurred for any period from inception to december  the utilization of these losses and credits depends on our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
because of the uncertainty of our generating taxable income  we have recorded a full valuation allowance with respect to these deferred assets 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission  or sec  defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding on their calls on judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue we record revenue from internet telephony services based on minutes or fractions thereof of customer usage 
we record revenue from related services based on completion of the specific activities associated with the services 
we record payments received in advance for prepaid services and services to be supplied under contractual agreements as deferred revenue until such related services are provided 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing the status of significant past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends and we then reduce accounts receivables by such allowance for doubtful accounts to expected net realizable value 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group  o significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  o significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  o accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of the long lived asset asset group  o current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  and o current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we determine the recoverability of long lived assets based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
such estimation process is highly subjective and involves significant management judgment 
determination of impairment loss from long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell

liquidity and capital resources since our inception in june  we have incurred significant operating and net losses due in large part to the start up and development of our operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million  long term investments of approximately million  and working capital of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of approximately million during compared with positive cash flow from operating activities of million during in compared to  even though we were able to reduce our net loss by million this was offset by the net changes we experienced in our current assets and liabilities  a decrease of million  and a decrease in our depreciation charges by million 
the changes that we experienced in our current assets and liabilities were driven by our strong growth in revenue and our ability to continue to slow our cash burn and pay down some of our current liabilities associated with employee related expenses 
in our net loss of million was higher than in  but this was offset by our depreciation adjustment million and our increase in accounts payable and deferred revenues  which together equaled approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities is generally driven by our annual capital expenditures and changes in our short and long term investments 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures and increased our investments by million  for a net increase use of million 
during net cash provided by investing activities was million  mainly due to used for purchase of property and equipment offset by million that was taken from our investments and used to fund our ongoing losses 
financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from exercise of employee options 
during  and our employees exercised options of million  million and million  respectively 
we obtained our funding from our utilization of the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering  offset by positive or negative cash flow from our operations 
these proceeds are maintained as cash  restricted cash  and short and long term investments 
based on current trends in our operations  these funds will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  including operating losses  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next fiscal year  assuming that our business plan is implemented successfully  and that o our recent revenue trends continue to increase  o our expense trends remain at or near the rates of rates  which were somewhat reduced compared to the previous the year  as a percentage of revenues  through a continuous focus on maximizing our personnel utilization  curtailment of discretionary expenditures  and optimized network rent and termination rates from our carriers  and o our net cash burn rate  which was significantly reduced compared to the previous year due to the foregoing factors to approximately million during  continues to improve throughout and beyond 
to the extent that these trends do not remain steady or if in the longer term we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy we may be required to raise additional funds for our ongoing operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to us 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  we may not be able to obtain additional subsequent financing  if necessary  if the debt security contains certain covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such debt security is outstanding 
we cannot assure you that any third party will be willing or able to provide additional capital on favorable terms or at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments such as investments and debt that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we believe our exposure to market risk is immaterial
