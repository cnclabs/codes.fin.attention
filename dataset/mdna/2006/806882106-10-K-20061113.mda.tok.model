item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in three industry segments 
the metals recycling business purchases  collects  processes and recycles steel and other metal through its facilities and trades and brokers scrap metal 
the auto parts business purchases used and salvaged automobiles and allows customers the opportunity to purchase parts in its self service and full service auto parts stores 
the auto parts business is also a supplier of autobodies to the metals recycling business  which processes the autobodies into sellable recycled metal 
the steel manufacturing business purchases recycled metal from the metals recycling business and uses its mini mill near portland  oregon  to melt recycled metal and produce finished steel products 
the steel manufacturing business also maintains mill depots in southern and central california 
the company provides an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through its vertically integrated business  including resale of used auto parts  processing autobodies and other metal products and manufacturing scrap metal into finished steel products 
key factors affecting the industries in which the company operates the following market factors and trends affect the company and its competitors in the markets in which they operate competition 
the recycled metal and steel industries are highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of factors  principally price 
us metal processors and steel manufacturers have experienced significant foreign competition in recent years 
for example  in and  lower cost recycled ferrous metals supplies from certain foreign countries adversely affected market selling prices for recycled ferrous metals 
since then  many of these countries have imposed export restrictions which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the world supply of recycled ferrous metals  which is believed to have had a positive effect on domestic metal processors selling prices 
in addition  in recent years  worldwide demand for finished steel products has been growing at a faster rate than the available supply of recycled ferrous metal  which is one of the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of steel 
as a result of the strong demand and tight supply of recycled metals  average selling prices since have remained high by historical standards 

table of contents consolidation in the steel industry 
there has been significant consolidation in the global steel industry 
within the past few years  the us steel industry has significantly consolidated  primarily led by mittal  united states steel corporation  nucor corporation and steel dynamics 
consolidation is also taking place in central and eastern europe as well as in china 
the government of china has publicly stated that it expects consolidation of the chinese steel industry and the top several producers in china to account for the majority of national production 
cross border consolidation has also occurred with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and economies of scale  particularly in response to the effective consolidation undertaken by raw material suppliers and consumers of steel products 
consolidation in the scrap metal industry 
the metals recycling industry has been consolidating over the last several years  primarily due to an increase in scrap metal prices  the growth in globalized demand for scrap metal  a high degree of fragmentation and the ability of large  well capitalized processors to achieve competitive advantages by investing in capital improvements to improve efficiencies and lower processing costs 
fragmentation of the auto parts industry 
the auto parts industry is characterized by diverse and fragmented competition  and is comprised of a very large number of aftermarket and used part suppliers of all sizes 
these companies range from large  multinational corporations  which serve both original equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket on a worldwide basis to small  local producers which supply only a few parts for a particular car model 
in addition  new competition has arisen recently from internet based companies 
the auto parts industry is also characterized by a wide range of consumers 
in some markets  consumers tend to demand original replacement parts  while in others are price sensitive and exhibit minimal brand loyalty 
cyclicality 
the recycled metal and steel industries are highly cyclical and are affected significantly by general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity  fluctuations in imports and exports  fluctuations in metal purchase prices and tariffs 
processed metal and steel prices are sensitive to a number of supply and demand factors 
recently  steel markets have been experiencing larger and more pronounced cyclical fluctuations  primarily driven by the substantial increase in chinese production and consumption 
this trend  combined with the upward pressure on costs of key inputs  mainly metals and energy  as well as transportation costs and logistics  presents an increasing challenge for steel producers 
the key drivers for maintaining a competitive position and positive financial performance in this challenging environment are product differentiation  customer service and cost reductions through improved efficiencies and economies of scale 
pricing and sales volume increases 
the domestic steel manufacturing industry continues to experience strong customer demand for steel products  especially finished steel products 
this strong demand and high domestic prices have resulted in an increase in competition from imported steel 
in the metals recycling industry  strong demand and tight supplies are expected to result in market conditions which will continue to be higher than historical averages but remain subject to normal cyclical volatility 
raw material and energy supply 
costs of key raw materials and energy  in particular natural gas  have continued to increase steeply due to imbalances between supply and demand in certain regions  as well as higher freight costs 
although steel prices typically follow trends in raw material prices as steel price surcharges are often implemented on contracted steel prices to recover increases in input costs  the percentage changes may not be proportional and there could also be time lag 
purchase prices for recycled metals obtained by metals processors have generally followed the same trends as selling prices to steel making customers  with regional market characteristics impacting the cost to acquire material 
regional purchase prices are influenced by the available supply of material  which is driven by a number of factors including population base  the existence of industries that utilize metals in the manufacturing process and a cost effective transportation infrastructure that provides the ability to transport recycled metals to processing facilities 
purchase prices are also driven by the competition for recycled metal  which is heavily influenced by the number of metals recyclers and steel manufacturers located in a particular region 
in addition  as purchase prices have remained high by historical standards  the number of competitors for recycled metal has increased  although the ability of the larger metals recyclers to invest in capital improvements to improve efficiencies and lower the cost of processing remains a competitive advantage 
shipping and handling 
the metal recycling and steel manufacturing industries are highly sensitive to transportation costs 
the cost to transport products can be impacted by many factors  including fuel prices  political events  governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability 
in particular  steel manufacturers rely on the availability of rail cars to transport finished goods to customers and raw 
table of contents materials to the mill for use in the production process 
recent market demand for rail cars along the west coast of the united states has been very high  which has reduced the number of available rail cars 
metal recycling companies also rely on the availability of cargo ships to transport their ferrous and nonferrous bulk exports to overseas markets 
demand for ocean going vessels has also been strong  which has reduced the number of ships available to transport product to markets 
changes in delivery methods  such as increased use of trucks for scrap metal delivery  may lead to increased raw material costs 
currency fluctuations 
demand from foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
strengthening of the us dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of products in the metals recycling  auto parts and steel manufacturing industries 
companies in these industries have no control over such fluctuations and  as such  these dynamics could affect revenues and operating income 
significant factors affecting results of operations and financial position the company s results of operations and financial position have been impacted by the following significant factors relating specifically to the company geographical concentration 
historically  a significant portion of the profits earned by the metals recycling business has been generated by sales to asian countries  principally china and south korea 
in addition  the company s sales in these countries were also concentrated with relatively few customers whose purchases vary depending on buying cycles and general market conditions 
however  in the company achieved its objective of greater diversity in its export sales with increased exports to taiwan  turkey  spain  malaysia  india  egypt  mexico and other areas of europe and asia 
as always  a significant change in buying patterns  political events  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other export restrictions in the united states or these foreign countries  severe weather conditions or general changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the financial results of the company 
union contracts 
the company has a number of union contracts  several of which were recently renegotiated 
if the company is unable to reach agreement on the terms of new contracts with any of its unions during future negotiations  the company could be subject to work slowdowns or work stoppages 
post retirement benefits 
the company has a number of post retirement benefit plans that include defined benefit  defined contribution  supplemental executive retirement benefit plan serbp and multiemployer plans 
the company s contributions to the defined benefit and serbp plans are determined by actuarial calculations which are based on a number of estimates  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  allocation of plan assets between equity or fixed income investments and expected rate of compensation increases  as well as other factors 
changes in these actual rates from year to year cause increases or decreases in the company s annual contributions into the defined benefit plans and changes to the expenses recognized in a current fiscal year 
in  the company froze further benefit accruals under its defined benefit plan and elected to provide future benefits through an enhanced defined contribution plan 
recently acquired businesses and future business 
in  the company completed transactions to separate and terminate certain metals recycling joint venture relationships as well as acquisitions in the metals recycling and auto parts businesses 
given the significance of these recently acquired businesses relative to the size of the company  rapid integration of these businesses is a critical element of the company s success 
the company believes it made substantial progress in achieving this integration during the fiscal year 
foreign business risks 
the company s metals recycling business faces risks associated with its business operations  including business activities in foreign countries with varying degrees of political risk 
it advances and loans money to suppliers for the delivery of materials at a later date 
credit is also periodically extended to foreign steel mills 
due to the nature of the global trading business  its operating margins are thinner than for other parts of the company s metals recycling business  which performs value added processing  thus  unsold inventory may be more susceptible to losses 
in addition  from time to time  both the united states and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which the company operates  which could affect the global availability of recycled ferrous metals 

table of contents replacement or installation of capital equipment 
the company installs new equipment and constructs facilities or overhauls existing equipment and facilities including export terminals from time to time 
some of these projects take several months to complete  require the use of outside contractors and experts  require special permits and easements and involve a high degree of risk 
many times in the process of preparing the site for installation  the company is required to temporarily halt or limit production for a period of time 
if problems are encountered during the installation and construction process the company may lose the ability to process materials  which may impact the amount of revenue it is able to earn  or may increase operating expenses and may result in increased inventory levels 
reliance on key pieces of equipment 
the company relies on key pieces of equipment in the various manufacturing processes 
these include the shredders and ship loading facilities at the metals recycling locations  the transformer  furnace  melt shop and rolling mills at the company s steel manufacturing business  and the electrical power and natural gas supply to all of the company s locations 
if one of these key pieces of equipment were to have a mechanical failure and the company were unable to correct the failure  revenues and operating income could be adversely impacted 
overview of the company s strategy acquisitions the company intends to continue to focus on growth through value creating acquisitions 
the company will pursue acquisitions it believes will create shareholder value and will earn after tax income in excess of its cost of capital 
with the company s continued strong balance sheet  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity  the company believes it is in an attractive position to complete reasonably priced acquisitions fitting the company s long term strategic plans 
processing and manufacturing technology improvements the company has made significant investments in modern equipment to ensure that its technology is cost efficient in order to produce high quality products and to maximize economies of scale 
the company will continue to invest in equipment to improve the efficiency and capabilities of its businesses 
during fiscal  and  the company spent  and million  respectively  on capital improvements 
these expenditures were incurred in order to modernize the company s metal processing facilities and self service and full service auto body stores and perform selected efficiency improvements in its steel manufacturing facility 
the company believes these projects will provide after tax returns in excess of the cost of capital and create shareholder value 
information technology during fiscal  the company continued its technology investment plan to upgrade its software and hardware in order to address the needs brought about by the company s recent and expected growth 
this plan also provided for the development of common software and hardware platforms for all of the company s businesses  the creation of a centralized data center  the addition of a chief information officer  and the expansion of the company s technology team

critical accounting estimates the company has identified critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the company s portrayal of its financial condition and operating results 
these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  including whether estimates are required to be made about matters that are inherently uncertain  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  environmental costs  contingencies  assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies  pension plan assumptions  stock based compensation assumptions and revenue recognition 

table of contents inventories the company s inventories primarily consist of ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal and used and salvaged vehicles 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of ferrous and nonferrous metal is determined principally using the average cost method 
the company s used and salvage vehicle inventory cost is established based upon the price the company pays for a vehicle  and includes buying  dismantling and  where applicable  storage and towing fees 
the accounting process utilized by the company to record unprocessed metal and used and salvage vehicle inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  the company relies on perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  the company not only runs periodic tests  but also performs monthly physical inventories 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect significant variances and will seldom detect smaller variations 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
in addition  the company establishes inventory reserves to further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step determines whether or not impairment has occurred and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
these consultants  environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate 
in a number of cases  it is possible that the company may receive reimbursement through insurance or from other potentially responsible parties identified in a claim 
in these situations  recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as an asset when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the fiscal year end differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
periodically  the company reviews its deferred tax assets to assess whether a valuation allowance is necessary 

table of contents pension plans the company sponsors a defined pension plan for certain of its non union employees 
pension plans are a significant cost of doing business  and the related obligations are expected to be settled far in the future 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans results in the current recognition of liabilities and net periodic pension cost over employees expected service periods based on the terms of the plans and the impact of the company s investment and funding decisions 
the measurement of pension obligations and recognition of liabilities and costs require significant assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the assets of the plan  may have an impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results will often differ from assumptions relating to long term rates of return for equities and fixed income securities because of economic and other factors 
for further detail regarding the company s pension plans  refer to liquidity and capital resources contained in item and note  employee benefits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in
