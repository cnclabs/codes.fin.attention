item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview our revenues are derived primarily from the operation of full service restaurants  the distribution and sale of premium ice cream desserts through retail locations and franchising 
as of january   we operated full service restaurants  franchised full service restaurants and seven non traditional units and manufactured a full line of premium ice cream desserts distributed through more than  supermarkets and other retail locations in states 
we were publicly held from until january  at which time we were acquired by hershey foods corporation hershey 
under hershey s ownership  the number of company operated restaurants increased from to hershey subsequently sold us in september to the restaurant company trc in a highly leveraged transaction the trc acquisition 
the high leverage associated with the trc acquisition has severely impacted our liquidity and profitability 
as of january   we had a stockholders deficit of million 
cumulative net interest expense of million since the trc acquisition has significantly contributed to the deficit 
our net loss in of million included million of interest expense  net and a provision for income taxes of million primarily due to an increase in our deferred income tax valuation allowance 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including the following i potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  ii because borrowings under our credit facility and mortgage financing in part bear interest at floating rates  we could be adversely affected by any increase in prevailing rates  iii we are more leveraged than certain of our principal competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  and iv our substantial leverage may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 
we have reported net loss income of million  million  million  million and million for    and  respectively

compared to revenues total revenues total revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in fiscal included a rd week of operations 
the additional week contributed million in total revenues as restaurants  foodservice and franchise segments provided million  million and million  respectively 
restaurant revenues restaurant revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in comparable company operated restaurant revenues decreased from to higher prices for gasoline  especially during the three weeks in september post hurricane katrina  appeared to have had a negative impact on the number of customer visits during all day parts  with our afternoon and evening snack periods experiencing the greatest declines 
comparable sales decreased for the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  but were flat the last two months of also contributing to the reduced comparable revenues was an unfavorable shift in the timing of the year end holiday period as included january  and january  also  there were additional operating days lost due to weather closings in when compared to as most markets in new england recorded higher than normal snowfall 
the rd week of operations in contributed million to the restaurant sales decline 
additionally  the closing of five locations and the re franchising of locations over the past months resulted in declines of million and million  respectively  in restaurant revenues in as compared to these declines were partially offset by increased revenues of million in as compared to due to the opening of six new restaurants over the past months 
there were two new restaurants opened during the year ended january  foodservice revenues foodservice product sales to franchisees and retail customers revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in franchised restaurant product revenue resulting from the increased number of franchised restaurants in compared to  which was partially offset by a decrease in franchised restaurant product revenue of million due to the rd week of operations in additionally  foodservice revenues were adversely impacted by a million decrease in sales to foodservice retail supermarket customers in compared to as a result of greater discounting in case volume in our retail supermarket business increased for the year ended january  when compared to the year ended january  primarily as a result of higher volume of individual sundae cups and the introduction of new decorative cakes 
discounting and sales allowances were greater as a percentage of gross revenues in when compared to foodservice retail revenues were million during the rd week in franchise revenues franchise royalty and fee revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due primarily to increases in royalties on franchised sales and rental income for leased and subleased franchise locations  partially offset by a decline in franchise fees 
royalties on franchised sales increased million in as compared to comparable franchised revenues grew from the year ended january  to the year ended january  the opening of new franchise restaurants and one caf and re franchised restaurants during the last months increased royalty revenues by million while the closing of six under performing locations during the same period reduced royalties by million 
royalties were million during the rd week in franchise fees declined by million during when compared to we re franchised company operated restaurants and franchisees opened six new restaurants during as compared to the re franchising of company operated restaurants and the opening of seven new restaurants and one new caf during additionally in  we received million in franchise fees associated with the sale of leasehold improvements and equipment and assignment of the lease for one re franchised location and the sale of equipment at three other re franchised locations to the existing franchisee 
an increase in rental income for leased and subleased franchise locations of million  due primarily to an increased number of leased and subleased franchised locations  also contributed to the higher revenues in compared to there were and franchise units open at january  and january   respectively 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was and in and  respectively 
a shift in sales mix from company operated restaurant sales to foodservice sales added to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue 
foodservice sales to franchisees and retail supermarket customers and of total revenues for the years ended january  and january   respectively have higher food costs as a percentage of revenue  at  than sales in company operated restaurants to restaurant patrons 
this increase was partially offset by the growth in franchise revenues  which reduced cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues by in when compared to since franchise revenues have no product costs associated with such revenues 
additionally  foodservice retail sales promotional allowances  recorded as offsets to revenues  increased by in as a percentage of sales to foodservice retail supermarket customers when compared to due to an increase in discounting activities during this increase had an unfavorable impact on the overall cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues 
manufacturing efficiencies improved during the current year when compared to a year ago  especially during the third and fourth quarters  due to cost reductions associated with scheduling improvements  however  higher fuel costs in versus offset most of the benefit 
restaurant cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues was and in and  respectively 
the relatively high price of butter in december resulted in unfavorable cream costs in the first quarter of  as the market price of butter is generally reflected in our cost of sales approximately days later 
during the remainder of  butter prices had a favorable impact on the price of cream when compared to the same period in the cost of cream was approximately million lower in the year ended january  when compared to the year ended january  in  market losses of million were realized due to unfavorable positions on commodity option contracts while market gains of million were realized in we enter into commodity option contracts from time to time to manage dairy cost pressures 
our commodity option contracts do not meet hedge accounting criteria as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendment  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and  accordingly  are marked to market each period with the resulting gains or losses recognized in cost of sales 
the table below shows the average monthly price of a pound of aa butter 
futures and options on aa butter are traded on the chicago mercantile exchange and aa butter is the commodity used to derive the price of cream 
the prices shown were obtained from market quotes provided by the united states department of agriculture s usda agricultural marketing service 
month january february march april may june july august september october november december mathematical avg the cost of cream  the principal ingredient used in making ice cream  affects cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues  especially in foodservice s retail business 
a increase in the cost of a pound of aa butter adversely affects our annual cost of sales by approximately million 
this adverse impact may be offset by price increases or other factors 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset any cost increases in the future and future increases in cream prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
to minimize risk  alternative supply sources continue to be pursued 
we purchased butter option contracts through the third quarter of to minimize the impact of increases in the cost of cream 
when available  options on butter futures were purchased to cover up to of the cream needs of the manufacturing plant 
option contracts are offered in the months of march  may  july  september  october and december  however  there is often not enough open interest in them to allow us to buy even very limited coverage without paying an exorbitant premium 
on september   the chicago mercantile exchange launched the first electronically traded  cash settled butter futures contract 
this new futures contract is designed to meet the needs of food and dairy companies that have exposure to butterfat price risk but do not want to expose themselves to the possibility of being compelled to take physical delivery of butter 
the size of the contract is  pounds of aa butter  versus the traditional butter futures contract  which is  pounds 
the contract is cash settled based upon the usda monthly weighted average price for butter in the united states 
with this new type of futures contract  there is no risk of delivery of butter  therefore it offers us the ability to hedge the price risk of cream on a butter basis without having to take delivery of commodity butter 
we have evaluated this new hedging instrument and believe it is an attractive way to hedge the price risk related to cream 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased a small number of these contracts  but did not achieve a significant level of protection 
labor and benefits labor and benefits decreased million  or  to million in from million in labor and benefits as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in as a percentage of restaurant revenues  labor and benefits decreased to in from in lower hourly labor costs accounted for of the decrease in labor and benefits costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues  which was primarily the result of restructuring of the restaurant management team with fewer guest service supervisors and more servers  resulting in lower average hourly rates

partially offsetting these benefits were increases in pension expense and other fringe costs of and  respectively  in when compared to revenue increases derived from franchised locations and product sales to franchisees and retail customers  which do not have any associated restaurant labor and benefits  also contributed to the lower labor and benefits as a percentage of total revenues

provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in management evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
a more in depth evaluation is made as part of the annual and strategic planning process conducted in the fourth quarter of each year 
as of january   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences that are available to reduce income taxes in future years 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods  and projections of future operating results 
where there are cumulative losses in recent years  sfas no 
creates a strong presumption that a valuation allowance is needed 
the presumption can be overcome in very limited circumstances 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered a three year cumulative loss position and revised our projections of the amount and timing of profitability in future periods 
as a result  we increased our valuation allowance by approximately million million to income tax expense and million to stockholders deficit to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability 
however  going forward should our return to profitability provide sufficient evidence  in accordance with sfas no 
 to support the ultimate realization of income tax benefits attributable to net operating loss and credit carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  a reduction in the valuation allowance may be recorded and the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be restored  resulting in a non cash credit to earnings 
the provision for income taxes also included a million increase in income tax accruals related to income tax audits and other tax matters as the irs is currently auditing fiscal years through during the second quarter of  we recorded million of the increase and during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional million 
the benefit from income taxes was million  an effective tax rate of  in  as the final benefit from income taxes for included a million reversal of income tax accruals recorded in prior years

the unfavorable impact of record snowfall during the first quarter of had a favorable impact on restaurant revenues when compared to the first quarter of  as operating days lost due to weather closings were minimal in however  sales growth in the fast food restaurant segment  higher gas prices and fewer ninety degree summer days in the northeast may have contributed to a decline in comparable restaurant revenues during nine and restaurants were re imaged during and  respectively 
the closing of company operated restaurants and the refranchising of restaurants over the months ended january  resulted in restaurant revenue declines of million and million  respectively  during as compared to these declines were partially offset by a million increase in restaurant revenues due to the opening of seven new restaurants over the months ended january  four of the new restaurants were opened in foodservice revenues foodservice revenues product sales to franchisees and retail customers increased million  or  to million in from million in franchised restaurant product revenues increased by million in as compared to due primarily to the increased number of franchised restaurants and selling price increases related to increased costs of dairy and other manufacturing ingredients and food and supply items 
sales to foodservice retail supermarket customers declined by million from to due primarily to a decline in case volume sold to retail supermarket customers 
case volume in our retail supermarket business fell by in when compared to increases in competitive discounting and a higher non discounted selling price to final consumers  as a result of higher ingredient costs  may have contributed to the case decline

day to day weather changes  particularly in the winter months  can result in over scheduling labor when daypart sales fall short of expectations

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the working capital needs of companies engaged in the restaurant industry are generally low and as a result  restaurants are frequently able to operate with a working capital deficit because i restaurant operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  ii rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and iii cash from sales is usually received before related expenses for food  supplies and payroll are paid

in addition  we completed three transactions in which three former employees received franchises to operate existing restaurants  with options to purchase the restaurants within two years 
if the options are exercised  the franchisees will also agree to develop new restaurants in future years 
proceeds from option transactions will be recognized upon purchase 
financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
outstanding debt sale leaseback and mortgage financings 
in december  we completed a financial restructuring plan which included the repayment of all amounts outstanding under our then existing credit facility and the purchase of approximately million of our senior notes with the proceeds from million in long term mortgage financing the mortgage financing and a million sale and leaseback transaction the sale leaseback financing 
in connection with the sale leaseback financing  we sold properties operating as friendly s restaurants and entered into a master lease with the buyer to lease the properties for an initial term of years under a triple net lease 
there are four five year renewal options and lease payments are subject to escalator provisions every five years based upon increases in the consumer price index 
interest on million of the original million from the mortgage financing is variable variable mortgages and the remaining million of the original million from the mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed annual rate of fixed mortgages 
the fixed mortgages have a maturity date of january  and are amortized over years 
on december   we completed a refinancing of the variable mortgages the variable refinancing 
under the terms of the loan agreement for the variable mortgages  we borrowed an aggregate sum of million at a variable interest rate equal to the sum of the day libor rate in effect at december  plus on an annual basis 
changes in the interest rate are calculated monthly and recognized annually when the monthly payment amount is adjusted 
changes in the monthly payment amounts owed due to interest rate changes are reflected in the principal balances  which are re amortized over the remaining life of the mortgages 
the loans under the variable mortgages have a maturity date of january  and are being amortized over years 
the primary purposes of the variable refinancing were to i reduce the variable interest rate on the variable mortgages from libor plus on an annual basis to libor plus on an annual basis  ii enable the partial prepayment of the loans  subject to applicable prepayment premiums during the first three years and an agreed upon release value for properties released in connection with partial prepayments  and iii permit partial lien releases on the properties subject to the loans upon partial prepayments 
in addition  in connection with this transaction  we prepaid two mortgage loans from the lender in the amount of million from existing cash 
in connection with the variable refinancing  we incurred direct expenses of million that were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  and million of costs that were included in intangible assets and deferred costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  these costs will be amortized over the term of the variable mortgages 
pursuant to the terms of the mortgage financing  we may sell properties securing our obligations provided that other properties are substituted in place of the sold properties 
the substituted properties must meet certain requirements under the terms of the mortgage financing 
in august  proceeds of million and million were received in connection with the sale of two mortgaged properties 
in connection with the variable refinancing  the mortgage on one of these properties was released 
a substitution property for the second property must be in place to secure our obligations no later than may  as of january   balances of million and million were held as collateral pending mortgage payment and property substitution and were included in restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  in september  we acquired additional financing secured by our newly constructed milford  ma restaurant the milford mortgage 
the financing provided for a real estate improvement and equipment loan 
the real estate improvement loan has a principal balance of million and is amortized over years with a balloon payment due on october  the equipment loan has a principal balance of million and is amortized over seven years with a balloon payment due on october  the interest rate is variable and is the sum of the day libor rate in effect at january  plus on an annual basis 
changes in the interest rate are calculated monthly and recognized annually when the monthly payment amount is adjusted 
changes in the monthly payment amounts owed due to interest rate changes are reflected in the principal balances  which are re amortized over the remaining life of the mortgages 
the variable rate notes are subject to prepayment penalties during the first three years 
all mortgage financings are subject to covenants  including various minimum fixed charge coverage ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants for the variable mortgages and the fixed mortgages as of january  as of january   we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio related to the milford mortgage 
we obtained a waiver from the milford mortgage lender on march  waiving this covenant requirement for the year ended january  senior notes 
in and  we purchased or redeemed all of the remaining outstanding senior notes in a series of transactions 
in february  we announced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for million of our senior notes which was financed with the proceeds from a million private offering of new senior notes the new senior notes  available cash and our credit facility 
in march  million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes were purchased at the tender offer and consent solicitation price of of the principal amount and million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes were purchased at the tender offer price of of the principal amount 
in april  the remaining million of senior notes were redeemed in accordance with the senior notes indenture at of the principal amount 
in connection with the tender offer  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred other direct expenses of million that were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  the million of new senior notes issued in march are unsecured senior obligations of ficc  guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by ficc s friendly s restaurants franchise  inc subsidiary  but are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of ficc  including the indebtedness incurred under our credit facility 
the new senior notes mature on june  interest on the new senior notes is payable at per annum semi annually on june and december of each year 
the new senior notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at any time on or after june  at ficc s option at redemption prices from to  based on the redemption date 
in addition  at any time prior to june   ficc may redeem  subject to certain conditions  up to of the aggregate principal amount of the new senior notes with the proceeds of one or more qualified equity offerings  as defined  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
revolving credit facility 
we have a million revolving credit facility 
the million revolving credit commitment less outstanding letters of credit is available for borrowing to provide working capital and for other corporate needs 
as of january  and january   total letters of credit outstanding were million and million  respectively 
during and  there were no drawings against the letters of credit 
the revolving credit loans bear interest at our option at either a the base rate plus the applicable margin as in effect from time to time the base rate at january  or b the eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin as in effect from time to time the eurodollar rate at january  
as of january  there were no revolving credit loans outstanding 
as of january   million of revolving credit loans were outstanding 
as of january  and january   million and million  respectively  was available for borrowing 
the credit facility has an annual clean up provision which obligates us to repay in full any and all outstanding revolving credit loans for a period of not less than consecutive days during the period beginning on or after may and ending on or before june or the next business day  if  in any year  june is not a business day of each calendar year  commencing with the calendar year  such that immediately following the date of such repayment  the amount of all outstanding revolving credit loans shall be zero 
the credit facility matures on june  the credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness  restricted payments such as dividends and stock repurchases  liens  mergers  investments and sales of assets and of subsidiary stock 
additionally  the credit facility limits the amount which we may spend on capital expenditures  restricts the use of proceeds  as defined  from asset sales and requires that we comply with certain financial covenants 
on march   we amended and restated the credit facility as of december  to  among other things  i revise certain financial covenants beginning with the fourth quarter of and extending through the credit facility maturity date of june  including leverage  interest coverage  minimum ebitda and the deletion of the tangible net worth covenant and ii permit certain transactions to be excluded from our annual capital expenditures limit 
as a result of the amendments  we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility as of january  we anticipate requiring capital in the future principally to maintain existing restaurant and plant facilities and to continue to renovate and re image existing restaurants 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will be between million and million in the aggregate  of which we expect to spend between million and million on restaurants 
our actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimated amounts 
we believe that the combination of the funds generated from operating activities and borrowing availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements  debt service requirements  lease obligations  capital requirements and obligations associated with the corporate restructurings 
contractual obligations the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  in thousands payments due by period fiscal years fiscal years beyond contractual obligations total long term debt capital lease and finance obligations operating leases purchase commitments amount of commitment expiration by period fiscal years fiscal years beyond other commercial commitments total letters of credit purchase commitments include commitments for raw materials  food products and supplies used in the normal course of business 
inflation the inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in the costs of cream  sweeteners  purchased food  labor and other operating expenses 
approximately of our restaurant employees are paid minimum wage under applicable federal and state minimum hourly wage rates 
accordingly  any changes to the federal or state minimum hourly wage rates would have an immediate impact on wages paid to these employees 
in addition  a significant change in the federal or state minimum hourly wage rates may result in an increase in hourly wage rates for other employees that are currently paid above the minimum rates 
we are able to minimize the impact of inflation on occupancy costs by owning the underlying real estate for approximately of our restaurants 
consistent with industry practice  we typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation  at least in part  through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future 
seasonality due to the seasonality of ice cream consumption  and the effect from time to time of weather on patronage of the restaurants  our revenues and operating income are typically higher in our second and third quarters 
geographic concentration approximately of the company operated restaurants are located  and substantially all of our retail sales are generated  in the northeast 
as a result  a severe or prolonged economic recession or changes in demographic mix  employment levels  population density  weather  real estate market conditions or other factors specific to this geographic region may adversely affect us more than certain of our competitors which are more geographically diverse 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties defined benefit pension plan certain of our employees are covered under a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
as of december   the measurement date  this plan had an accumulated benefit obligation of million  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets of million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the plan  we recorded a charge to stockholders deficit during the year ended january  of million 
we initially recorded an additional minimum pension liability in  the first measurement date where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
we also recorded a charge to stockholders deficit during the years ended december  and january  of million and million million and million  net of income tax benefit  respectively 
as of january   the cumulative additional minimum pension liability included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was million million  net of income tax benefit and deferred income tax valuation allowance 
given the sensitivity of the projected benefit obligation to changes in discount rates  future changes in market interest rates may significantly increase or reduce the pension plan funded status 
we expect our net periodic pension cost to increase from million in to million in during  lump sum cash payments to participants exceeded the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost 
as a result of the settlement volume  we recorded additional pension expense of million during the year ended january  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
issued by the securities and exchange commission requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods that we use 
our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere herein  should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the critical accounting policies and most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  insurance reserves  recoverability of accounts receivable  pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits expense  asset impairment analysis  income tax valuation allowances and tax contingency reserves 
actual amounts could differ significantly from the estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the operation of full service restaurants  the distribution and sale of premium ice cream desserts through retail and institutional locations and franchising 
we recognize restaurant revenue upon receipt of payment from the customer and foodservice revenue product sales to franchisees and retail customers  net of discounts and allowances  upon delivery of product 
reserves for discounts and allowances from retail sales trade promotions are estimated and accrued when revenue is recorded based on promotional planners prepared by our retail sales force 
due to the high volume of trade promotion activity and the difficulty of coordinating trade promotion pricing with our customers  differences between our accrual and the subsequent settlement amount occur frequently 
usually these differences are individually insignificant 
to address the financial impact of these differences  our estimating methodology takes these smaller differences into account 
we believe our methodology has been reasonably reliable in recording trade promotion accruals 
the accrual for future trade promotion settlements as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
a variation of five percent in the accrual would change retail sales by approximately million 
franchise royalty income  generally calculated as of net sales of franchisees  is recorded monthly based upon the actual sales reported by each franchisee for the month just completed 
franchise fees are recorded as revenue upon completion of all significant services  generally upon opening of the restaurant 
insurance reserves we are self insured through retentions or deductibles for the majority of our workers compensation  automobile  general liability  employer s liability  product liability and group health insurance programs 
self insurance amounts vary up to million per occurrence 
insurance with third parties  some of which is then reinsured through restaurant insurance corporation ric  our wholly owned subsidiary  is in place for claims in excess of these self insured amounts 
ric reinsures of the risk from million to million per occurrence through september  for ficc s workers compensation  general liability  employer s liability and product liability insurance 
subsequent to september   we discontinued our use of ric as a captive insurer for new claims 
our liabilities for estimated ultimate losses for workers compensation  automobile  general liability  employer s liability and product liability coverages are actuarially determined and recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis 
the projections of estimated ultimate losses are based on commonly used actuarial procedures 
these procedures take into consideration certain actuarial assumptions or management judgments regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim settlement practices 
while the estimated ultimate losses are reasonable  any actuarial estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the volatility inherent in casualty exposures and changes in the assumptions 
our provision for insurance expense reflects estimated amounts for the current year as well as revisions in estimates to prior years 
actual losses could vary significantly from the estimated losses and would have a material effect on our insurance expense 
our reserves have historically been within the range of management s expectations 
we record a liability for our group health insurance programs for all estimated unpaid claims based primarily upon loss development analyses derived from actual claim payment experience provided by our third party administrators 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral to secure accounts receivable 
the credit review is based on both financial and non financial factors 
we maintain a reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts to ensure receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
bad debt reserves are maintained for customers in the aggregate based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  significant one time events and historical experience 
an additional reserve for individual accounts is recorded when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
our reserves have historically been within the range of management s expectations 
pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits certain of our employees are covered under a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits is dependent upon the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in health care costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and post retirement medical and life insurance obligations and expense 
we used a discount rate assumption of  and in the calculation of net periodic pension benefit cost for  and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension cost by million 
we reduced our discount rate assumption to for valuing obligations as of january  from at january   due to the declining interest rate environment 
keeping all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption from would have increased the january  pension benefit obligation by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption from would have decreased the january  pension benefit obligation by million 
for  and  an asset return assumption of  and  respectively  was used in the calculation of net periodic pension cost and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost was based on the market related value of pension plan assets 
a one percentage point decrease in the long term asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the long term asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension cost by million 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our non friendly marks  which were assigned to us by hershey in september  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we recognize impairment has occurred when the carrying value of the non friendly marks license agreement fee exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the trademarked products 
additionally  we review long lived assets related to each restaurant to be held and used in the business quarterly for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we evaluate restaurants using a two year history of cash flow as the primary indicator of potential impairment 
based on the best information available  we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value  which becomes its new cost basis 
estimated fair market value is based on our experience selling similar properties and local market conditions  less costs to sell for properties to be disposed of 
in addition  restaurants scheduled for closing are reviewed for impairment and depreciable lives are adjusted 
the impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected terminal value 
sfas no 
requires a long lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale to be classified as held and used until it is disposed of 
sfas no 
also requires the results of operations of a component of an entity that is classified as held for sale or that has been disposed of to be reported as discontinued operations in the statement of operations if certain conditions are met 
these conditions include commitment to a plan of disposal after the effective date of this statement  elimination of the operations and cash flows of the entity component from the ongoing operations of the company and no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the entity component after the disposal transaction 
during  we disposed of properties and had properties that met the criteria for held for sale 
the results of operations for these restaurants and any net gain or loss associated with the disposals of the property and equipment are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended january  during the year ended january   we determined that the carrying values of six restaurant properties and certain capital inventory used to replace restaurant equipment exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell 
the carrying values were reduced by an aggregate of million 
during the year ended january   we determined that the carrying value of a vacant restaurant land parcel and the carrying value of one restaurant property exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell 
the carrying values were reduced by an aggregate of  during the year ended december   we determined that the carrying value of one land parcel exceeded its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the carrying value was reduced by  considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from these estimates 
leases and deferred straight line rent payable we lease many of our restaurant properties 
leases are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
leasehold improvements that are acquired subsequent to the inception of a lease are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or a term that includes option periods that are reasonably assured at the date of the purchase 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and record the difference between the rents paid and the straight line rent as a deferred straight line rent payable 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred utilizing prorated periodic sales targets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
we record deferred tax assets to the extent we believe there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior to their expiration 
to the extent deferred tax assets may be unable to be utilized  we record a valuation allowance against the potentially unrealizable amount and record a charge against earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several different tax jurisdictions 
we are periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we record estimated reserves for probable exposures 
due to ever changing tax laws and income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
we must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currently recorded 
accordingly  we believe estimates related to income taxes are critical 
derivative instruments and hedging agreements we purchase butter option contracts to minimize the impact of increases in the cost of cream 
when available  options on butter futures are purchased to cover up to of the cream needs of the manufacturing plant 
option contracts are offered in the months of march  may  july  september  october and december  however  there is often not enough open interest in them to allow us to buy even very limited coverage without paying high premiums 
in addition to hedging  we pursue fixed price cream contracts to manage dairy cost pressures 
we were unable to find a supplier interested in an agreement for a fixed price load of cream for part of the year or the full year of  and the situation surrounding the supply of cream which depends on milk production  milk per cow  number of cows  butter inventories  etc 
is very uncertain in the wake of the national milk producers federation s cooperatives working together program 
on september   the chicago mercantile exchange launched the first electronically traded  cash settled butter futures contract 
this new futures contract is designed to meet the needs of food and dairy companies that have exposure to butterfat price risk but do not want to expose themselves to the possibility of being compelled to take physical delivery of butter 
the size of the contract is  pounds of aa butter  versus the traditional butter futures contract  which is  pounds 
the contract is cash settled based upon the usda monthly weighted average price for butter in the united states 
with this new type of futures contract  there is no risk of delivery of butter  therefore it offers us the ability to hedge the price risk of cream on a butter basis without having to take delivery of commodity butter 
we have evaluated this new hedging instrument and believe it is an attractive way to hedge the price risk related to cream 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased a small number of these contracts  but did not achieve a significant level of protection 
our strategy related to hedging is never to hedge more than of our needs using these instruments  so as not to put us in an uncompetitive position 
our commodity option contracts and the cash settled butter futures contracts do not meet hedge accounting criteria as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendment  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and  accordingly  are marked to market each period with the resulting gains or losses recognized in cost of sales 
during  and  losses gains of approximately million  million and million  respectively  were included in cost of sales related to these contracts 
contingencies from time to time we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not believe that the resolutions of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
on february   s 
prestley blake blake  holder of approximately of our outstanding common stock  sued friendly s and our chairman in a purported derivative action in hampden superior court  massachusetts 
the suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of corporate assets in that we paid certain expenses relating to a corporate jet and the chairman s use of that jet and use of an office in illinois 
the suit seeks to require the chairman to reimburse us and for friendly s to pay blake s attorneys fees 
friendly s and its chairman have denied blake s allegations and are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
on june   mr 
blake sent a demand letter to our board of directors demanding that our board of directors address his concerns and beliefs that are subject to the litigation filed on february  on july   our board of directors formed a special litigation committee consisting solely of independent directors the committee to investigate the concerns and beliefs raised in blake s demand letter dated june  the committee issued its report on october  and a supplemental report on november  based on its findings  the committee filed a motion to dismiss the claims made by mr 
blake 
as of the date hereof  the court has not issued its ruling on the committee s motion to dismiss 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation for employees under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and elected the disclosure only alternative under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation costs of approximately million  million and million related to modified option awards were included in net loss income in  and  respectively  for our stock option plan and our incentive plan 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we have continued to disclose the required pro forma information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp concludes that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period are for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a leased asset and that there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period 
therefore  rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of fsp is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change of estimate affected by a change in accounting principles 
sfas no 
also carries forward without change the guidance in apb opinion no 
with respect to accounting for changes in accounting estimates  changes in the reporting unit and correction of an error in previously issued financial statements 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than the first annual period beginning after june  sfas no 
r allows companies to choose between the modified prospective and modified retrospective transition alternatives in adopting sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost will be recognized in financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all shared based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
under the modified retrospective transition method  compensation cost will be recognized in a manner consistent with the modified prospective transition method  however  prior period financial statements will also be restated by recognizing compensation cost as previously reported in the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
the restatement provisions can be applied to either all periods presented or to the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
r is adopted 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
as we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 we will recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
on december   our board of directors approved the vesting of all outstanding and unvested options for our stock option plan and our incentive plan 
this action was taken to reduce  or eliminate to the extent permitted  the transition expense related to outstanding stock option awards under sfas no 
r 
the  options that were vested included  options with exercise prices greater than our closing stock price on the modification date 
under the accounting guidance of apb opinion no 
 the accelerated vesting resulted in stock based compensation cost of approximately  net of related income tax benefit of  which was included in net loss for the year ended january  additionally  the effect of the accelerated vesting in our pro forma disclosure note of notes to consolidated financial statements was incremental stock based compensation of approximately million net of related income tax benefit of million 
the portion of this stock based compensation expense related to future vesting would otherwise have been recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r in our consolidated statements of operations over the next two fiscal years 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we have accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas r in fiscal will result in the recognition of stock compensation expense of approximately million related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units outstanding at january  additionally  we expect to recognize stock compensation expense of million to million related to newly issued awards in the actual stock compensation expense recognized in may vary from this estimated amount because it will depend upon levels of share based payments granted and forfeited in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior years for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we have market risk exposure to interest rates on our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes 
the information below summarizes our market risk associated with our debt obligations as of january  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by expected year of maturity 
for variable rate debt obligations  the average variable rates are based on implied forward rates as derived from appropriate monthly spot rate observations as of year end 
because the mortgage loans are privately held  we believe that the carrying value of the mortgage loans as of january  approximated the fair value
