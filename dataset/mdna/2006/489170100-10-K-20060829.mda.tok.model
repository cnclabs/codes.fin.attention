unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc is a leading global supplier of tooling  engineered components and advanced materials consumed in production processes 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence and technological expertise and innovation in our principal products has helped us achieve a leading market presence in our primary markets 
we believe we are the second largest global provider of metalcutting tools and tooling systems 
fiscal was a challenging and fulfilling year for us 
we achieved significant growth in sales and earnings  strengthened our market position and improved our financial strength 
during  we reshaped our business portfolio through selective divestiture of our non core businesses and acquisitions of businesses that offer strategic technologies to position us for future growth 
we divested j l in and have exited owned distribution 
we will continue building new distributor relationships while strengthening our existing relationships 
we also divested presto and electronics in in addition  we announced the divestiture of cpg 
these divestitures will allow us to focus on growing our core businesses 
we also completed a business acquisition in that further expanded our extrude hone product offering related to electro chemical machining 
we believe that these transactions will create a stronger foundation for kennametal that will position us for long term growth and profitability 
we will continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas where appropriate 
in  we completed the re launch of widia products in north america 
while widia product sales in europe have been weak  our metalworking sales in north america and india related to these products have shown positive growth 
additionally  in we expect to evaluate potential acquisition candidates that offer strategic technologies in an effort to continue to grow our amsg business and maintain our mssg market position 
we successfully implemented product price increases to offset the impacts of rising raw material costs and increased our focus on cost containment through lean deployment 
rising raw material costs  particularly tungsten  caused profitability challenges for us in gross profit margin increased to percent in from percent in this basis point increase was driven by improved price realization and benefits from lean initiatives 
operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased basis points to percent in versus percent in we have also planned operating expense initiatives for to leverage the success of lean and increase long term profitability 
through strong cash flow generation  we were able to further strengthen our balance sheet as of june  working capital increased million or percent to million at june  from million at june  debt to equity decreased to percent at june  from percent at june  some of the more significant cash flow items for included proceeds from the divestiture of j l of million  purchases of our common stock amounting to million and million of pension funding related to our uk and uk defined benefit pension plans 
acquisitions and divestitures effective june   we divested presto for proceeds of million as a part of our strategy to exit non core businesses 
this divestiture resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
included in the loss is a million inventory charge reported in cost of goods sold 
this business was a part of the mssg segment 
cash flows of this component that will be retained have been deemed significant in relation to prior cash flows of the disposed component 
the sale agreement includes a three year supply agreement that management deems to be both quantitatively and qualitatively material to the overall operations of the disposed component and constitutes significant continuing involvement 
as such  the results of operations of presto prior to the divestiture are reported in continuing operations 
effective june   we divested j l for proceeds of million  subject to post closing adjustment  as a part of our strategy to exit non core businesses 
this divestiture resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
the inventory related portion of this gain amounting to million was recorded in cost of goods sold 
we also recorded million of divestiture related charges in our corporate segment that are included in operating expense 
cash flows of this component that will be retained have been deemed significant in relation to prior cash flows of the disposed component 
the sale agreement includes a five year supply agreement and a two year private label agreement 
management deems these agreements to be both quantitatively and qualitatively material to the overall operations of the disposed component and constitutes significant continuing involvement 
as such  j l results are reported in continuing operations 
we continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas where appropriate 
we also continue to evaluate opportunities that allow for the introduction of new and or complimentary product offerings into new and or existing market areas where appropriate 
in  we expect to evaluate potential acquisition candidates that offer strategic technologies in an effort to continue to grow our amsg business and maintain our mssg market position 
discontinued operations during the quarter ended june   our board of directors and management approved plans to divest electronics and cpg as part of our strategy to exit non core businesses 
these divestitures are accounted for as discontinued operations 
as a result  prior years financial results have been restated to reflect the activity from these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the divestiture of electronics  which was part of the amsg segment  will occur in two separate transactions 
the first transaction closed during we recognized a pre tax loss of million  including an million inventory related charge  which has been recorded in discontinued operations 
the second transaction is expected to close during the first half of we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million during the third quarter of related to cpg based primarily on a discounted cash flow analysis 
we subsequently signed a definitive sales agreement to divest cpg  which was part of the mssg segment  for net consideration of approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments 
the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of we recognized a pre tax loss of million  which has been recorded in discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million based on the expected proceeds from the sale of the business 
these charges are not deductible for income tax purposes and have been recorded in discontinued operations

restructuring and goodwill impairment charges goodwill impairment charges in and  we did not incur any goodwill impairment charges with respect to our continuing operations 
see the discussion of discontinued operations within this md a for goodwill impairment charges related to the announced divestiture of cpg

other income  net for and included fees of million and million  respectively  related to the accounts receivable securitization program 
income taxes the effective tax rate for is percent compared to percent for the increase in the effective rate from to is primarily driven by permanent differences related to the divestiture of j l  the income tax expense associated with cash repatriated under the american jobs creation act of ajca  impairment charges related to the divestiture of presto for which tax benefits could not be recognized and the impact of adopting sfas r 
the impact of these items are partially reduced by a favorable resolution of tax contingencies with the internal revenue service  which is primarily related to a research and development tax credit claim  the favorable effect of operating under a new business model in europe and reversal of a valuation allowance that resulted from a change in circumstances that caused a change in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in europe 
during the current year  we implemented an enhanced pan european centralized business model  which involved the establishment of a principal company 
in this structure  key management decision making and responsibility are centralized in the principal company that maintains the responsibility to drive all strategic and operational initiatives of the european business 
manufacturing and sales operations have been transformed into toll manufacturers and limited risk distributors 
service functions have also been organized into separate units  which now allows these functions to intensify their focus on and increase their efficiency in production  sales growth and supporting services  following clearly defined and uniform processes as directed by the principal company 
on october   the ajca was enacted 
during  we completed our evaluation of a provision within the act that provides for a special one time tax deduction of percent of foreign earnings that are repatriated to the us  as defined by the act  and repatriated million of foreign earnings under the act 
notwithstanding this one time repatriation  the unremitted earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection therewith 
the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the increase in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by the negative impact of a german tax law change enacted in december of and non deductible goodwill written off in association with the divestiture of fss partially offset by changes in valuation allowances in europe

liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and internal growth 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs throughout changes in the economic cycle 
in march  we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement  which amends our credit agreement 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen 
interest payable under the credit agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be libor plus an applicable margin  the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus percent or fixed as negotiated by us 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including two financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as those terms are defined in the agreement 
as of june   outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million 
as of june   million of these borrowings were denominated in us dollars and million were denominated in euros 
we had the ability to borrow under the agreement  or otherwise incur  additional debt of up to billion as of june  and remain in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  we generally obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million of notes payable and million of term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  approximately percent of our debt was exposed to variable rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for variable versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of variable to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable pension benefit payments postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt includes interest obligations of million 
interest obligations were determined assuming interest rates as of june  remain constant

annual payments are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts noted in the table 
capital leases include interest obligations of million 
purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments for materials  supplies and machinery and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business 
purchase obligation with variable price provisions were determined assuming current market prices as of june  remain constant 
less than more than other commercial commitments total year years years years standby letters of credit guarantees total the standby letters of credit relate to insurance and other activities 
cash flows from discontinued operations are not deemed material and have been combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have a material impact on our future liquidity and capital resources 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to cash flow provided by operating activities for consists of net income and non cash items totaling million offset by net changes in certain assets and liabilities of million 
contributing to this change was million of collections in excess of amounts securitized under our accounts receivable securitization program  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  which includes million for funding a portion of our uk and uk defined benefit pension plans  and an increase in accrued income taxes of million due primarily to divestiture activities 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities consisted of net income and non cash items totaling million offset by net changes in certain assets and liabilities of million 
contributing to this change were increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  due to increased sales and million of net repayments of our accounts receivable securitization program resulting from the fss divestiture 
in  net cash provided by investing activities of million includes proceeds from divestitures of million offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  which consisted primarily of equipment upgrades  and million used for the acquisition of business assets 
in  net cash used for investing activities of million included million used for the acquisition of business assets and million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  which was primarily used to support our growth in china and india  offset by million of proceeds from divestitures 
we have projected our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  which will be used primarily to support new strategic initiatives  new product development and to upgrade machinery and equipment 
we believe this level of capital spending is sufficient to maintain competitiveness and improve productivity 
net cash used for financing activities is million in compared to million in this increase is due primarily to the purchase of million of our common stock in  under its previously announced share repurchase program  offset by an increase in dividend reinvestment and activities related to our employee benefit and stock plans of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an agreement with a financial institution whereby we are permitted to securitize  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in a specific pool of our domestic trade accounts receivable up to million at june  securitization program 
the securitization program provides for a co purchase arrangement  whereby two financial institutions participate in the purchase of our accounts receivable 
pursuant to this agreement  we  and certain of our domestic subsidiaries  sell our domestic accounts receivable to kennametal receivables corporation krc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
a bankruptcy remote subsidiary is a company that has been structured to make it highly unlikely that it would be drawn into a bankruptcy of kennametal inc  or any of our other subsidiaries 
krc was formed to purchase these accounts receivable and sell participating interests in such accounts receivable to the financial institutions  which in turn purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets 
as collections reduce the amount of accounts receivable included in the pool  we sell new accounts receivable to krc  which in turn securitizes these new accounts receivable with the financial institutions 
the actual amount of accounts receivable securitized each month is a function of the net change new billings less collections in the specific pool of domestic accounts receivable  the impact of detailed eligibility requirements in the agreement eg  the aging  terms of payment  quality criteria and customer concentrations and the application of various reserves  which are typical in trade receivable securitization transactions 
a decrease in the amount of eligible accounts receivable could result in our inability to continue to securitize all or a portion of our accounts receivable 
the financial institutions charge us fees based on the level of accounts receivable securitized under this agreement and the commercial paper market rates plus the financial institutions cost to administer the program 
the costs incurred under this program  million  million and million in  and  respectively  are accounted for as a component of other income  net and represent attractive funding costs compared to existing bank and public debt transactions 
at june   there were no accounts receivable securitized under this program 
in june  total collections on accounts receivable securitized reduced these amounts to zero 
no additional accounts receivable were securitized after this reduction 
at june   we securitized accounts receivable of million under this program 
our subordinated retained interests in accounts receivable available for securitization and recorded as a component of accounts receivable was million at june  the securitization program was a three year program  which contained certain provisions that required annual approval 
we have obtained such approval annually 
we amended the securitization program on july  the facility was reduced from million to million 
the facility can be increased  if necessary  with the approval of the financial institutions and completion of the appropriate amendment documentation 
we may evaluate the need for further amendment based on our future funding requirements and the relative economics associated with various funding alternatives 
we intend to maintain the program on a year to year basis to the extent that it continues to represent attractive funding costs and liquidity 
non renewal of this securitization program would result in our requirement to otherwise finance any amounts securitized 
we anticipate that the risk of non renewal of this securitization program with the current providers or some other providers is low 
in the event of a decrease of our eligible accounts receivable  such as occurred in  or non renewal or non annual approval of our securitization program  we will utilize alternative sources of capital to fund that portion of our working capital needs 
financial condition at june   total assets are  million  compared to  million at june  working capital is million at june   an increase of percent from million for  primarily due to proceeds from the divestiture of j l totaling million partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes of million resulting primarily from divestiture activity and the tax impact of cash repatriated under the ajca 
at june   other assets are million  an increase of million from million at june  the increase is primarily attributed to an increase in pension assets of million due to contributions to our uk and uk defined benefit pension plans of million and an increase in discount rate assumptions applied to our defined benefit pension plans as of june  this increase is partially offset by a decrease in goodwill and intangible assets of million mainly as a result of the j l divestiture and a million goodwill impairment charge related to the divestiture of cpg 
total liabilities increased million from  million at june  to  million at june  this increase is driven by increases in current liabilities of million previously discussed in working capital and increases in long term debt and capital leases of million and deferred income taxes of million 
this increase is partially offset by decreases in accrued pension benefits of million due to current year funding levels coupled with an increase in discount rates from shareowners equity is  million at june   an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributed to net income of million  the effect of employee stock and benefit plan activity of million and other comprehensive income of million partially offset by repurchases of common stock totaling million and cash dividends of million 
environmental matters we are involved as a prp at various sites designated by the usepa as superfund sites  including the li tungsten superfund site in glen cove  new york 
with respect to the li tungsten site  we recorded an environmental reserve following the identification of other prps  an assessment of potential remediation solutions and an entry of a unilateral order by the usepa directing certain remedial action 
this led us to conclude that it was probable that a liability had been incurred 
the reserve represented our best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation based on discussions with outside counsel and the preliminary evaluation of our independent consultant 
in may  we reached an agreement in principle with the doj with respect to this site  the doj informed us that it would accept a payment of million in full settlement for its claim against us for costs related to the li tungsten site 
to date  the draft consent order and agreement for settlement of our li tungsten liability has not been finalized  but we expect that the final settlement will proceed according to the terms outlined in the agreement in principle 
at june  and  we had an accrual of million and million  respectively  recorded relative to this environmental issue 
cash payments made against this reserve during were million 
as a result of the settlement  we reversed million of our established liability to operating expense 
during  we were notified by the usepa that we have been named as a prp at the alternate energy resources inc site located in augusta  georgia 
the proceedings in this matter have not yet progressed to a stage where it is possible to estimate the ultimate cost of remediation  the timing and extent of remedial action that may be required by governmental authorities  or the amount of our liability  if any  alone or in relation to that of any other prps 
reserves for other potential environmental issues at june  and were million and million  respectively 
the reserves we have established for environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the costs of addressing all identified environmental situations  based on our review of currently available evidence  and take into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies  as well as public information released by the usepa  other governmental agencies  and by the prp groups in which we are participating 
although the reserves currently appear to be sufficient to cover these environmental liabilities  there are uncertainties associated with environmental liabilities and we can give no assurance that our estimate of any environmental liability will not increase or decrease in the future 
the reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  the financial strength of other prps  the identification of new prps  and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters 
we maintain a corporate eh s department  as well as an eh s policy committee  to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to monitor and oversee remediation activities 
in addition  we have established an eh s administrator at each of our global manufacturing facilities 
our financial management team periodically meets with members of the corporate eh s department and the corporate legal department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we review financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies and adjust such reserves when appropriate 
effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs  in particular the cost of certain raw materials  continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases under highly competitive conditions 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship product or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned product and do not consider the effect of returned product to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential product returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer  and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and prior to the divestiture in  fss management contracts contained two major deliverables product procurement and inventory management 
under the fixed fee contracts  we recognized revenue evenly over the contract term 
revenue was recognized upon shipment for cost plus contracts 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for unvested awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r on july  we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish fair value of all awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
this evaluation is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care costs is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on review of published mortality tables 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a method of recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure within the financial statements for uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take in a tax return 
fin is effective for kennametal july  we are in the process of evaluating the provisions of fin to determine if there will be any impact of adoption on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce both earnings and cash flow volatility  allowing us to focus our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income  net in the current period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report of form k for additional information 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates are million and million  respectively 
we would have paid million and received million at june  and  respectively  to settle these contracts  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert notional amounts of million of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
the outstanding agreements mature in june of we would have received million and paid million at june  and  respectively  to settle these interest rate swap agreements  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to variable interest rates 
these agreements mature in june but provide for a one time optional early termination for the bank counterparty in june at the then prevailing market value of the swap agreements 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have materially reduced earnings in and increased earnings in and as compared to the prior year periods 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
