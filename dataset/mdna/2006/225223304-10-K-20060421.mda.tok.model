item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under item a 
risk factors  beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
restatement of consolidated financial statements we have restated our previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ending december   including interim periods in  to correct a million non cash error with respect to revenue recognized under one of our product development contracts 
we have determined that certain costs were incorrectly charged to this contract in the contract is accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
as restated  revenue was decreased by million  cost of product revenue was decreased by million  research and development expense was increased by million  and net loss was increased by million 
there was no impact on our cash or short term investment position 
all amounts referenced for in this annual report  including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  reflect the relevant amounts on a restated basis 
see note restatement of previously issued financial statements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes to our consolidated statement of operations for and consolidated balance sheet as of december  overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computer systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
these systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific and engineering computing problems for government  industry and academia 
during  our revenue primarily came from sales of our cray xt  cray xe and cray xd systems  from government funding for our red storm and cascade development projects and from providing maintenance and other services to our customers 

table of contents we are dedicated solely to the supercomputing market 
we have concentrated our product roadmap on building balanced systems combining highly capable processors whether developed by ourselves or by others along with highly scalable software with very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities throughout the entire computing system  not solely from processor to processor 
we believe we are very well positioned to meet the high performance computing market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages over low bandwidth and cluster systems when sustained performance on challenging applications and workloads and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
strategic focus we are focused on strategies that we believe will improve our financial results and increase returns for our shareholders 
our financial goals include sustained annual revenue growth  annual operating income improvement  and increased operating cash flows 
our revenue  results of operations and cash balances are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
these fluctuations are due to such factors as the high average sales prices and limited number of sales of our larger products  the timing of product orders and deliveries  our revenue recognition accounting policy under which we generally do not recognize product revenue until customer acceptance and other contractual provisions have been fulfilled  the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance services  government research and development funding and our purchases of inventory 
given the nature of our business  our revenue  receivables and other related accounts are likely to be concentrated among a few customers 
to achieve these goals over time  we are focused on recapturing the leadership position in the capability class supercomputing market which represents the largest and most complex systems in the world  estimated to be a million to billion market in recent years 
our total addressable market  which we view as the capability market and those parts of the enterprise market where we have competitive advantages  is approximately billion 
to further this goal  we have aligned our research and development and sales and marketing efforts to achieve our adaptive supercomputing vision  which is intended to integrate multiple processing technologies into a single  highly scalable system to provide high performance and enhanced user productivity 
our adaptive supercomputing vision  which we will roll out over time starting in  incorporates many of our technical strengths massively parallel  vector  multithreading and other hardware co processing technologies and high bandwidth networks into a single system 
summary of results revenue increased by million or from due to initial product sales of our cray xt and cray xd products and a year over year increase in cray x xe sales  partially offset by lower revenue recognized on our cascade and red storm projects 
loss from operations improved to a loss of million in from a loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to three factors a million increase in gross margin on higher sales  million of operating cost containment and improvements due to the second quarter restructuring activities  including workforce reduction and pay reduction program and increased government funding of research and development  and a million charge in for the write off of in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of octigabay systems 
net cash used in operations improved in from a use of cash of million in to a use of cash of million in cash balances increased million during and we did not borrow amounts under our line of credit agreement 
however  during we sold million of short term investments and utilized million of cash previously restricted during the year 
market overview and challenges the most significant trend in the high performance computing market is the continuing expansion and acceptance of low bandwidth and cluster systems using microprocessors manufactured by intel  amd  ibm and others with commercially available commodity networking and other components throughout the high 
table of contents performance computing market  especially in capacity computing situations 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements  even at times in capability market procurements 
to compete against these systems in the longer term  we need to incorporate greater performance differentiation across our products 
we believe we will have such differentiation through our new vector based product being developed in our blackwidow project and our new multithreaded product being developed in our eldorado project 
these products  which focus initially on a narrower market than our commodity processor products  are expected to be available in one of our challenges is to broaden the markets for these products 
we must add greater performance differentiation to our high bandwidth massively parallel commodity processor based products  such as the cray xt and successor systems  while balancing the business strategy trade offs between using commodity parts  which are available to our competitors  and proprietary components  which are both expensive and time consuming to develop 
we intend to grow our share of the capability market and concentrate on those parts of the enterprise market where we have competitive advantages 
our success depends on several other factors  including timely  efficient execution of our research and development plans which should provide us with leading edge technologies 
we must effectively market and sell products that utilize these technologies as differentiated products and continue to broaden our geographic markets in europe and asia 
we need to continue to successfully obtain co development funding for certain of our research and development efforts 
longer term  our adaptive supercomputing vision incorporates our broad technical strengths into a single system  reducing our expected development costs 
our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing revenue profitably despite the high level of competitive activity 
there continue to be competitive pressures that we must respond to related to pricing  product performance and availability of application software 
we must manage each of these factors  as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our customers  in order to compete effectively and achieve our business goals 
our product costs are subject to fluctuations  particularly due to changes in our production levels 
higher sales volumes allow us to achieve lower component pricing and recover our fixed overhead more effectively than if volumes are low 
technological changes in our products may result in writing down certain inventories below cost based upon their estimated future use 
our operating costs are subject to fluctuations due to the timing and level of development co funding and other factors 
as our international business expands  we must manage our foreign currency risks as we enter into agreements that are not denominated in the us dollar and not naturally hedged by expenses that are incurred in the same foreign currency 
the major uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our business  operations and prospects and that could affect our future results and financial condition are set forth above under item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  the accounting for loss contracts and stock based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 

table of contents additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those related to valuation estimates of deferred tax assets  valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market  estimates to complete for percentage of completion accounting on the red storm and cascade contracts and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to our customer  title and risk of loss for products has passed to our customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no significant unfulfilled obligations exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue and for multiple element arrangements 
products we recognize revenue from our product lines  as follows cray x xe and cray xt product lines we recognize revenue from product sales upon customer acceptance of the system  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract that affect the customer s final acceptance  the price is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
cray xd product line we recognize revenue from product sales of cray xd systems upon shipment to  or delivery to  the customer  depending upon contract terms  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract  the price is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if there is a contractual requirement for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of the notice of acceptance and when we have no unfulfilled obligations 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex information technology systems to a customer s specifications is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects under aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components or services 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and margins on a cumulative basis 
to the extent the estimate of total costs to complete the contract indicates a loss  such amount is recognized in full at that time 
services revenue for the maintenance of computers is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we consider fiscal funding clauses as contingencies for the recognition of revenue until the funding is assured 
high performance computing service revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the element could be sold separately  
table of contents the fair value of the undelivered element is established  and in cases with any general right of return  our performance with respect to any undelivered element is within our control and probable 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element as the elements would not be considered a separate unit of accounting and revenue would be recognized as described above under our product line or service revenue recognition policies 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon installation and acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the sales price as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand of our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
during  we charged a total of million for write down of inventory of which million was related to cray xe inventory  million was related to cray xd inventory  and million was related to cray xt inventory 
in  we wrote down cray x inventory by million and cray xd inventory by million  for a total of million 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december   consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the cray research business unit assets from sgi in and our acquisition of octigabay systems corporation in april we no longer amortize goodwill associated with the acquisitions  but we are required to conduct ongoing analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
we currently have one operating segment and reporting unit 
as such  we evaluate any potential goodwill impairment by comparing our net assets against the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
we performed annual impairment tests effective january  and january   and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
the analysis of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired and the number and nature of our reporting units involves a substantial amount of judgment 
future changes related to the amounts recorded for goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
in connection with our acquisition of octigabay systems corporation  we assigned million of value to core technology 
in december we announced plans to further integrate our technology platforms  and combine the cray xd and the cray xt products into a unified product offering 
the expected undiscounted cash flows from the product using the core technology were not sufficient to recover the 
table of contents carrying value of the asset 
we performed a fair value assessment similar to the original valuation and determined the asset had no continuing value 
we wrote off the unamortized balance of our core technology intangible asset of million accordingly  we recorded a million charge in to restructuring  severance and impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with this charge  we reversed the remaining deferred tax liability of million that was established in the purchase accounting as amortization of this intangible asset was not deductible for income tax purposes 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the provision for or benefit from income taxes represents taxes payable or receivable for the current period plus the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance amounts during the period 
in  we reversed million of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets principally us loss carryforwards based primarily upon our consideration of our most recent profitable operating performance as well as our reasonably expected future performance 
based upon our judgment of the positive and negative evidence  we concluded that we would more likely than not be able to utilize most of our net deferred tax asset 
in late  we established a valuation allowance and recorded an income tax expense of million based on our losses from operations in and based on our revised projections indicating continued challenging financial results 
based upon our most recent negative operating results  which we consider as a strong indicator of our future ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we established a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets principally us loss carryforwards created during in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for loss contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  certain production contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion accounting method 
we recognize revenue based on a measurement of completion comparing the ratio of costs incurred to date with total estimated costs multiplied by the contract value 
inherent in these estimates are uncertainties about the total cost to complete the project 
if the estimate to complete results in a loss on the contract  we will record the amount of the estimated loss in the period the determination is made 
on a regular basis  we update our estimates of total costs 
changes to the estimate may result in a charge or benefit to operations 
in  we estimated that the red storm contract would result in a loss of million  which was charged to cost of product revenue 
during  we increased the estimate of the loss on the contract by million cumulative loss of million due to additional hardware to be delivered to satisfy contractual and performance issues 
this amount was charged to cost of product revenue 
as of december   and  the balance in the red storm loss contract accrual was million and million  respectively and is included in other accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under the intrinsic value method  we did not record any expense when stock options granted were priced at the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
certain of the 
table of contents stock options granted in connection with the octigabay systems acquisition in had exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date and accordingly  we have recorded compensation expense over the vesting period based on the intrinsic value method 
in march and may  we accelerated vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than the current market price at the date of the acceleration 
these options were accelerated to avoid recording future compensation expense with respect to such options in and thereafter when we will be using the fair value method of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r to account for stock based compensation 
we believed that because such options had exercise prices substantially in excess of the current market value of our stock  the options were not achieving their original objective 
options to purchase million shares of common stock were subject to the acceleration and the weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was 
due to this acceleration  an additional million is included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  in december  we repriced  existing stock options to per share and also issued  additional stock options at per share fair market price of our common stock on the date of issuance that had immediate vesting  in order to enhance short term retention and also to avoid future option expense charges 
commencing january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the number of options granted in the future  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed and actual award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no 
r 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for further information 
recent accounting pronouncements as of december   we accounted for stock based compensation awards using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb no 
accordingly  we recorded no compensation expense in and previous years for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
on december   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  and in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
to stock compensation awards 
rather  sfas no 
r requires enterprises to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january   using the modified prospective application method and the black scholes fair value option pricing model 
under this method sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption is recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption is based on the fair value at the date of grant of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
 stock based compensation 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will impact our financial results in the future  as it is expected to reduce our net income or increase our net losses 
as of december   we have unamortized stock based compensation expense of million  of which million is expected to be expensed in however  this amount does not reflect the expense associated with equity awards that are expected to be granted to employees in management is currently reviewing its alternatives for granting equity based 
table of contents awards and  while we expect to continue granting equity based awards to our employees  the type  frequency and amount of award are still under consideration 
accordingly  the overall effect of adopting this new standard on the financial results for has not yet been quantified 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share  if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb no 
 are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  stock based compensation of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although such pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r except for the impact of the acceleration of vesting of substantially all employee stock options in  the provisions of these two statements differ in important respects 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and provides guidance to ensure consistency in recording legal obligations associated with long lived tangible asset retirements 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
previously  voluntary changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp no 

the european union issued a directive to its member states to adopt legislation regulating the collection  treatment  recovery and disposal of electrical and electronic waste equipment 
the directive distinguished between new waste and historical waste 
fsp no 
provides guidance concerning the accounting for historical waste and states that the obligation associated with historical waste qualifies as an asset retirement obligation to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
we have certain inventory components that must comply with this new directive but at this time we cannot quantify the impact to our financial results  as many of the european union member states have not finalized legislation 
in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp no 

fsp no 
provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities  as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements 
fsp no 
is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and earlier application is permitted 
this new pronouncement will be effective in and we do not believe that adoption of fsp no 
will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations revenue our product and service revenue for the years ended december   and were in thousands  except for percentages december  restated product revenue percentage of total revenue service revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue product revenue the increase in product revenue over levels was due to increased sales of all three of our principal products  the cray xe  the cray xt and the cray xd systems  which became available after a production ramp up during the first half of the year 
in  we recorded approximately million in product revenue from the cascade and red storm development projects which was a reduction of million compared to due to reduced expenditures and associated revenue  in particular on the red storm development project 
product revenue declined in from due to significantly reduced cray x system sales and the inability to recognize revenue on certain cray xe and cray xt systems delivered in the fourth quarter of  offset in part by an increase in red storm and cascade development project revenue of million to million for we expect product as well as total revenue to grow in by approximately to  with revenue primarily coming from sales of cray xt and upgrade systems 
a wider range of product revenue results is reasonably possible see item a 
risk factors  above 
included in this expected product revenue growth is approximately million to be recognized for our cray x xe installation at the korea meteorological administration kma 
this system was accepted in the fourth quarter of  is in production  and we have received full payment but contract provisions with regard to significant unfulfilled obligations have delayed our ability to recognize revenue on the contract until the fourth quarter of we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter with nearly of product revenue expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter 
our plan is dependent on having an upgraded version of the cray xt system delivered  installed and accepted by customers before year end 
product revenue generated from the phase portion of the cascade program should end in july any future cascade project funding in phase may not be recorded as revenue  but rather as a reduction to research and development expense  as we expect the total amount of funding to be received in phase to be less than the total estimated development effort 
service revenue service revenue in decreased slightly from due to lower revenue on maintenance contracts as older systems were withdrawn from service 
revenue from professional services increased by million from million in due principally to a contract to refurbish certain components for a customer 
service revenue decreased in from due to expiring maintenance contracts as older systems were withdrawn from service 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon installation of the product  which may include a warranty period 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to 
table of contents maintenance service revenue based on estimates of fair value 
we recognize revenue ratably over the entire service period 
maintenance service revenue has declined on an annual basis as older systems are withdrawn from service 
while we expect our maintenance service revenue to stabilize over the next year  we may have periodic revenue and margin declines as our older  high margin service contracts are ended and newer  lower margin contracts are established  based on the timing of system withdrawals from service 
our newer products will likely require less hardware maintenance and therefore generate less maintenance revenue than our historic vector systems 
operating expenses cost of revenue cost of product revenue and cost of service revenue for the years ended december   and were in thousands  except for percentages december  restated cost of product revenue percentage of product revenue cost of service revenue percentage of service revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue  although improved compared to  was impacted by several factors  including higher sales of the lower margin cray xd product  an additional million charge for a change in the estimate to complete the red storm project due principally to the addition of hardware deliverables to settle contract and performance issues  and million of charges for inventory write downs  which includes scrap and obsolete inventory 
cost of product revenue was negatively impacted by inventory write downs of million  a million charge to record the initial estimated loss on the red storm project  a million adjustment for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead relating to lower than planned production of cray x systems and significant revenue recognized on the cascade and red storm projects  which have a high cost to revenue percentage  with red storm cost equal to revenue 
the red storm and cascade research and development costs totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  are reflected on our financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded in our financial statements as product revenue 
revenue for  and includes million   and  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
in  this amount consisted mainly of the sale of a refurbished cray te supercomputer  one of our legacy systems 
we anticipate increased product margins in  although still below our desired levels 
sales of cray xt and cray xd systems face margin pressure from the highly competitive clustered systems market 
in addition  we expect total product margin will be adversely affected by low margin contribution from the kma system  which we expect to recognize in the fourth quarter of  low margin contribution from the cascade project in the first half of the year and anticipated zero margin on revenue from the red storm project  for which we have recorded estimated losses in and we also face increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory as the cray xe and cray xd products reach the end of their product life 
we also face increased risk and expense related to compliance with new european environmental rules 
see item a 
risk factors new european environmental rules may adversely affect our operations 
cost of service revenue 
in both and  our cost of service revenue was favorably impacted by high margin professional service contracts  service cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of and the second half of both and  and the completed amortization of legacy spare parts inventory by march   offset in in part by increased costs incurred to achieve customer acceptances of large cray xt systems 
we expect service costs for to approximate to of service revenue 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands december  restated gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of product revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue net research and development expenses in primarily reflect our costs associated with the hardware and software associated with the cray xe  cray xt and cray xd systems  and the eldorado multithreaded system  and their upgrade and successor projects 
net research and development expenses in reflect our costs associated with the development of the cray xe  cray xt  cray xd systems and upgrade and successor projects  including related software development 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted engineering expenses 
gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and cascade projects 
research and development expenses on our red storm and cascade projects are reflected as cost of product revenue and government co funding on our other projects are recorded as reimbursed research and development 
we have received increased government funding each year during this period 
in  net research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased as compared to due to higher revenue  increased funding for our blackwidow project  and the effect of the pay reduction program in the second half of  partially offset by option expense as we accelerated vesting on options issued in connection with the octigabay acquisition in the higher percentage of total revenue compared to is due to lower revenue earned in and to increases in research and development expenses for most of our products and projects including an increase of approximately million to million per quarter due to the octigabay acquisition at the beginning of the second quarter in 
in  we expect higher gross research and development expenses but lower net research and development expenses  based on increased government project funding 
this expectation assumes that we will receive a phase award in the darpa hpcs program and thus have increased cascade project activity in the second half of the year 
we will continue to incur development expenses for our cray xt and upgrade and successor systems and we expect increased activity on our blackwidow and eldorado projects 
if we receive a phase darpa award  our development costs will no longer be fully funded for that work and we must contribute a portion of such costs that will be recorded in net research and development expenses 
we expect to receive additional funding for our blackwidow and eldorado projects  although anticipated reimbursements on these projects have not yet been fully authorized and all necessary contracts have not been completed 
if these projects are not funded by the government as anticipated  or if we do not receive a phase of darpa hpcs project  our research and development expense could be much higher than anticipated and have an adverse impact on our earnings in

for the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant quarter to quarter  as well as within a quarter  fluctuations in our cash balances 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  operations and credit facility

cash used in operating activities during the first half of was partially offset by improved second half cash flow 
assuming acceptances and payment for large new systems to be sold and benefit from our and restructurings and other recent cost reduction efforts  we expect our cash flow to be slightly negative in  although a wide range of results is possible 
currently  we do not anticipate borrowing from our credit line during  although it is possible that we may have to do so 
if we were to experience a material shortfall in our plans  we would take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our operating results and available cash resources 
the range of actions we could take includes  in the short term  reductions in inventory purchases and commitments  seeking financing from investors  strategic partners and vendors and other financial sources and further reducing headcount related expenses 
we have been focusing on expense controls  negotiating sales contracts with advance partial payments where possible  implementing tighter purchasing and manufacturing processes and improving working capital management in order to maintain adequate levels of cash 
while we believe these steps will generate sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  we may consider enhancing our cash and working capital position by raising additional equity or debt capital 
there can be no assurance that we would succeed in these efforts or that additional funding would be available 
additionally  the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products  particularly the cray xt and upgraded systems  with adequate margins 
beyond the next twelve 
table of contents months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we did not have any short term investments 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for receipt of cash in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
in order to limit such risks on large transactions that may extend over a longer period of time  we may choose to hedge this risk with a forward exchange contract 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our earnings and cash flows by approximately
