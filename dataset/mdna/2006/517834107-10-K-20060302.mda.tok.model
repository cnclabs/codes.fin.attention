table of contents management target markets the congress center to complement the operations of the sands expo center for business conferences and upscale business events typically held during the mid week period  thereby generating room night demand and driving average daily room rates during the weekday move in move out phases of the sands expo center s events 
events at the sands expo center and the congress center typically take place during the week when las vegas hotels and casinos experience lower demand  unlike weekends and holidays during which occupancy and room rates are at their peak 
our goal is to draw from attendees and exhibitors at the sands expo center s events and from attendees of the congress center s events to maintain mid week demand at the hotel from this higher budget market segment  when room demand would otherwise be derived from the lower budget tour and travel group market segment

the las vegas market the las vegas market has shown consistent growth over both the near and long terms in both visitation and expenditures and has one of the highest hotel occupancy rates of any major market in the united states 
according to the lvcva  the number of visitors traveling to las vegas has increased at a steady and significant rate over the last years  from million visitors in to approximately million visitors in in addition  the population of clark county has more than doubled in the last years  from approximately  in to approximately million in we believe that the growth in the las vegas market has been enhanced by the introduction of large luxury and themed destination resorts in las vegas  such as the venetian  the bellagio  the mandalay bay resort casino and the wynn las vegas resort 
these world class properties attract new visitors to las vegas while also gaining share from older  smaller and or undifferentiated resorts  the increased capacity to host large scale trade shows and conventions  and the increased capacity of mccarran international airport 

table of contents las vegas as a trade show  convention and meeting destination according to the lvcva  las vegas has been among the most popular trade show and convention destinations in the united states in recent years 
the following table indicates the rise in number of trade show and convention attendees in las vegas and amounts spent by attendees between and  according to the lvcva 
year attendees amount spent in millions in billions in  the lvcva changed its reporting methodology for conventions and trade shows to account for numerous smaller meetings not previously included in lvcva counts 
the majority of the room demand from trade show and convention attendees is generated during weekdays while tourist visits to las vegas are higher on weekends 
as a result  the trade show convention market segments have been specifically targeted as prime avenues for driving mid week traffic to las vegas 
trade shows are held for the purpose of getting sellers and buyers of products or services together in order to conduct business 
trade shows differ from conventions in that trade shows typically require substantial amounts of space for exhibition purposes and participant circulation 
conventions generally are gatherings of companies or groups that require less space for breakout meetings and general meetings of the overall group 
las vegas offers trade shows and conventions a unique infrastructure for handling the world s largest shows  including the concentration of approximately  hotel rooms in according to the lvcva  three convention centers the las vegas convention center the lvcc with million square feet  the mandalay bay convention center with million square feet and the sands expo center  convenient air service from major cities throughout the united states and other countries  and significant entertainment opportunities 
expanding hotel market las vegas has been among the most popular travel destinations in the united states in recent years  with hotel occupancy rates among the highest of any major market in the country 
to accommodate this popularity  las vegas has experienced a period of rapid hotel development  with the number of hotel and motel rooms in las vegas increasing from  in to approximately  in according to the lvcva 
much of this increase occurred in the late s with the opening of the venetian  the bellagio  the mandalay bay resort casino  paris las vegas and aladdin  among others 
the concentration of luxury and themed casino hotels and resorts is expected to continue encouraging visitor interest in las vegas as a trade show  convention and vacation destination and  as a result  increase overall demand for hotel rooms  gaming and entertainment 
in addition  management expects the wynn las vegas resort located next to our properties to continue to improve foot traffic around and interest in the sections of the las vegas strip between flamingo road and sands avenue  where our properties are located 
although las vegas was impacted by the events of september   with overall visitors down and hotel occupancy down from  the market began to rebound in  with the number of visitors in surpassing levels 

table of contents growth of las vegas retail sector and non gaming revenue expenditures an increasing number of destination resorts are developing non gaming entertainment to complement their gaming activities in order to draw additional visitors 
according to the lvcva  while gaming revenues in clark county have increased from approximately billion in to approximately billion in a compound annual growth rate  non gaming tourist revenues increased from billion in to billion in a compound annual growth rate 
the newer  large luxury and themed las vegas destination resorts have been designed to capitalize on this growth by providing better quality hotel rooms at higher rates and by providing expanded shopping  dining and entertainment venues  as well as meeting facilities  to their patrons in addition to gaming 
infrastructure improvements clark county and metropolitan las vegas have completed several infrastructure improvements to accommodate the increase in travel to las vegas by all modes of transportation 
according to the lvcva  in last full year for which data is available visitors to las vegas arrived by the following methods of transportation by air  by auto  by recreational vehicle and by bus 
mccarran international airport expansion during recent years  the facilities of mccarran international airport have been expanded to accommodate the increased number of airlines and passengers that it services 
the number of passengers traveling through mccarran international airport has increased from approximately million in to approximately million in long term expansion plans for mccarran international airport provide for additional runway and related areas  terminal concourse expansions  a new control tower and other facilities and is currently expected to be completed in competition in las vegas the casino hotel industry is highly competitive 
hotels on the las vegas strip compete with other hotels on and off the las vegas strip  including with hotels in downtown las vegas 
the venetian also competes with a large number of hotels and motels near las vegas 
many of our competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large public companies and may have greater financial and other resources than we have 
in particular  the acquisition of mandalay resort group by mgm mirage and the acquisition of caesars entertainment inc by harrah s entertainment created the world s two largest gaming companies 
hotel casino properties competitors of the venetian include themed resorts on the las vegas strip  such as the bellagio  the mandalay bay resort casino and paris las vegas 
recent hotel additions include the approximately room bellagio spa tower that opened and the approximately  room addition to caesars palace that opened in august in april  the wynn las vegas resort  an approximately  hotel room resort and casino  opened on sands avenue next to the palazzo 
off the las vegas strip  boyd gaming corporation opened its south coast hotel and casino in december five miles south of mandalay bay on las vegas boulevard 
future competition includes mgm mirage s project citycenter  a multi billion dollar urban complex that is expected to consist of hotels and condominium towers  and casino and retail  dining and entertainment venues 
the first phase of project citycenter is expected to open in in addition  wynn las vegas resort plans a second hotel tower  the encore  with  suites and additional casino  retail and convention space that is expected to open in the second half of other announced projects include boyd gaming s billion   room echelon place resort complex to be located on the site of the stardust hotel on the northern end of the las vegas strip 
echelon place is expected to include approximately million square feet of convention and meeting space and is expected to open in in addition  a renovation and rebranding of the approximately  room aladdin is expected to be completed in october a newly formed company  fontainebleau resorts  also plans to build a  room hotel and casino on the north end of the las vegas strip that is expected to open in some of these facilities are operated by 
table of contents companies that have more than one operating facility and may have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do and target the same demographic group as we do 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
native american tribes in california are permitted to operate casinos with video gaming machines  black jack and house banked card games 
the governor of california has entered into compacts with numerous tribes in california and has announced the execution of a number of new compacts with no limits on the number of gaming machines  which was limited under the prior compacts 
the federal government has approved numerous compacts in california and casino style gaming is now legal on those tribal lands 
while the competitive impact on our operations in las vegas from the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california remains uncertain  the proliferation of gaming in california and other areas located near the venetian could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the hotel casino operation of the venetian also competes  to some extent  with other hotel casino facilities in nevada and in atlantic city  hotel casino and other resort facilities elsewhere in the country and the world  internet gaming websites and state lotteries 
in addition  certain states have legalized  and others may legalize  casino gaming in specific areas 
the continued proliferation of gaming venues could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in particular  the legalization of casino gaming in or near major metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers  such as new york  los angeles  san francisco and boston  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in october  the new york legislature approved a bill for expanded casino gaming on native american reservations and video lottery terminals 
in and  maine and pennsylvania  respectively  approved legislation legalizing slot machines or similar electronic gaming devices at certain locations  although this legislation has not been implemented yet 
a number of states have permitted or are considering permitting gaming at racinos  on native american reservations and through expansion of state lotteries 
the current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and the resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to our las vegas facilities  by attracting customers close to home and away from las vegas  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
trade show and convention facilities the sands expo center  the congress center  and las vegas generally compete with trade show and convention facilities located in and around major us cities  including atlanta  chicago  new york  and orlando 
within las vegas  the sands expo center and the congress center compete with the lvcc  which is located off of the las vegas strip and currently has approximately million gross square feet of convention and exhibit facilities 
in addition to the lvcc  the mandalay bay resort casino has an approximately million square foot convention center 
the mgm grand hotel and casino has a conference and meeting facility of approximately  square feet and the mirage has approximately  gross square feet of meeting space 
the wynn las vegas resort has  square feet of convention  meeting and reception space and plans additional convention space at its proposed encore facility 
the conference and meeting facilities at these hotel resorts are the congress center s primary las vegas competition 
boyd gaming corporation s echelon place is expected to include approximately million square feet of convention and meeting space when it opens in the lvcc and the mandalay bay convention center are the primary competitors of the sands expo center 
in february  the lvcva approved an approximately million project to expand and upgrade the lvcc  which is expected to be completed in we believe the lvcc expansion project will make it more competitive with private convention and meeting providers like us 
to the extent that any of the competitors of the venetian can offer a hotel casino experience that is integrated with substantial trade show and convention  conference and meeting facilities  the venetian s competitive advantage in attracting trade show and convention  conference and meeting attendees could be adversely affected 
other cities  such as boston  orlando  and pittsburgh  are also in the process of developing  or have announced plans to develop  convention centers and other meeting  trade and exhibition facilities 

table of contents the macao market introduction located less than an hour away from hong kong via a hydrofoil ferry system  macao is regarded as one of the largest and fastest growing gaming markets in the world 
macao also has the advantage of sharing a border with china s guangdong province  which has more than million residents and is the most populous and prosperous region of china 
macao benefits from being the only market in china to offer legalized casino gaming 
since the reversion of macao from portugal to china  gaming revenue in macao has grown from approximately billion in to approximately billion in  reflecting a compound annual growth rate 
visitor volume has grown from approximately million in to approximately million in  according to the macao statistics and census service  a compound annual growth rate 
gaming customers traveling to macao generally come from nearby countries in asia  such as mainland china  hong kong  taiwan  south korea and japan 
approximately billion people are estimated to live within a three hour flight from macao and approximately billion people are estimated to live within a five hour flight from macao 
according to the macao statistics and census service monthly bulletin of statistics  of the tourists who visited macao in came from hong kong or mainland china and the dominant feeder markets to macao have been and continue to be hong kong and china 
although the absolute number of visitors from hong kong continues to grow  that market has shrunk as a percentage of the total visitor distribution from in to in  while mainland china made up of total visitors in the number of visitors from china has exhibited consistent growth from to  with a compound annual growth rate in the number of visitors for that period 
until recently  mainland chinese were only permitted to visit macao as part of a tour group 
now that these travel restrictions have eased for mainland chinese from certain urban centers and economically developed regions  individual travel to macao is expected to generate increased demand for casino offerings 
macao as a gaming and resort destination in may  the sands macao became the first las vegas style casino to open in macao 
our superior gaming product is expected to enable us to capture a meaningful share of the overall growth of the market  including the vip player market segment  in macao 
although we believe that the continued improvement of the casino gaming regulations by the macao government  including the enactment of casino credit and collection legislation effective july   will enable us to effectively compete in the vip player market segment  our business in macao may not be able to realize the full benefits of extending credit to our customers if laws are not changed 
gaming revenues in macao in reached a record billion  a increase over visits to macao were up in  compared to according to macao statistics and census service monthly bulletin of statistics  during the first months of  of visitors traveling to macao stayed overnight in hotels and guestrooms and  for those who stayed overnight in hotels and guestrooms  the average length of stay was only or nights 
management expects this length of stay to increase with increased visitation  the expansion of gaming and the addition of upscale hotel resort accommodations in macao 
according to the macao statistics and census service  in  there were hotels and guest houses in operation in macao  of which nine were classified as star 
these hotels and guest houses maintained approximately  rooms and experienced approximately occupancy rates during the first months of table games are the dominant form of gaming in asia 
baccarat is by far the most popular game  followed by blackjack  sic bo  roulette and other traditional us and asian games 
slot machines are offered in macao  but they are few in number because the structure of the gaming market in macao has historically favored table gaming 
however  with the increase in the mass market gaming in macao  this is changing and slot machines of international standards are becoming an important feature of the market 
we believe the limited emphasis on slot machines in the past also reflects the market s perception that slots offered in macao 
table of contents were an inferior slot product 
by contrast  in other gaming venues catering to an asian clientele  slot machines are in high demand and profitable 
we expect the slots business to grow in macao and we intend to introduce more modern and popular products to appeal to the asian marketplace 
we believe that as new facilities and standards of service are introduced  macao will become an even more desirable tourist destination and has the potential to become a larger gaming market than las vegas 
the improved experience of visitors to macao should lead to longer stays and an increased number of return trips from existing feeder markets and the opening of several new feeder markets 
the gaming licensees selected to invest in gaming facilities and foster the growth of the macao gaming market have committed to invest in macao  a total of at least billion patacas approximately billion at exchange rates in effect on december  
the substantial financial commitment by these gaming licensees is expected to help boost future gaming revenue and stimulate investment in other macao tourism and leisure activities 
in  china s gross domestic product totaled approximately trillion compared to trillion in and billion in on a per capita basis  china s gross domestic product was  in we believe that a wealthier chinese middle class will lead to increased travel to macao and generate increasing demand for gaming entertainment and casino resort offerings 
we also believe that the combination of less onerous travel restrictions  greater ability of chinese citizens to bring renminbi the chinese currency to macao  increasing regional wealth and the opening of world class facilities will convert macao from primarily a day trip market to a multi day travel destination similar to las vegas  where management estimates the average visitor stays approximately three nights 
proximity to major asian cities gaming customers from hong kong  southeast china  taiwan and other locations in asia can reach macao in a relatively short period of time  using a variety of methods of transportation  and visitors from more distant locations in asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to macao or to hong kong followed by a short water ferry or helicopter trip to macao 
the relatively easy access from major population centers promotes macao as a popular gaming destination in asia 
macao draws a significant number of gaming customers from both visitors and residents of hong kong 
one of the major methods of transportation to macao from hong kong is the hydrofoil ferry service 
the hydrofoil ferry offers service up to five times per hour  with trips to and from macao taking under an hour

employees we directly employ approximately  employees in connection with the venetian  approximately employees in connection with the sands expo center and approximately  employees in connection with the sands macao 
in addition  we hire temporary employees on an as needed basis at the venetian 
the venetian s employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
most  but not all  major casino resorts situated on the las vegas strip have collective bargaining contracts covering at least some of the labor force at such sites 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
the unions currently on the las vegas strip include local of the hotel employees and restaurant employees international union  the operating engineers union and the teamsters union 
local has requested us to recognize it as the bargaining agent for employees of the venetian 
we have declined to do so  believing that current and future employees are entitled to select their own bargaining agent  if any 
in the past  when other hotel casino operators have taken a similar position  local has engaged in certain confrontational and obstructive tactics  including contacting potential customers  tenants  and investors  objecting to various administrative approvals and picketing 
local has engaged in such tactics with respect to the venetian and may continue to do so 
although we believe we will be able to operate despite such dispute  no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so or that the failure to do so would not result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
although no assurances can be given  if employees decide to be represented by labor unions  management does not believe that such representation would have a material impact upon our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
we are not aware of any union activity at the sands macao 
certain casual culinary personnel are hired from time to time for trade shows and conventions at the sands expo center and are covered under a collective bargaining agreement between local and the sands expo center 
this collective bargaining agreement expired in december as a result  the sands expo center is operating under the terms of the expired bargaining agreement with respect to these employees 
intellectual property our principal intellectual property consists of  among others  the sands  venetian  palazzo and paiza trademarks  all of which have been registered in the united states 
in addition  we have also applied to register the marks cotai strip  macau strip  and asia s las vegas  among others  in connection with 
table of contents our development projects in macao 
these trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services 
we consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification 
we believe that the name recognition  reputation  and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities 
once granted  our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are periodically renewed 
it is our intent to maintain our trademark registrations

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form k in connection with evaluating the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
certain statements in risk factors are forward looking statements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to our business our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
consumer demand for hotel casino resorts  trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending brought about by factors such as fears of war  future acts of terrorism  general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could reduce customer demand for the luxury products and leisure services we offer  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations 
our business is sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel 
acts of terrorism and developments in the conflict in iraq could cause severe disruptions in air travel that reduce the number of visitors to our facilities  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel 
a substantial number of our customers for the venetian use air travel to come to las vegas 
on september   acts of terrorism occurred in new york city  pennsylvania and washington  dc as a result of these terrorist acts  domestic and international travel was severely disrupted  which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to las vegas  including to the venetian and the sands expo center 
in addition  developments in the conflict in iraq could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel 
most of our customers travel to reach either the venetian or the sands macao 
only a small amount of our business is generated by local residents 
management cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any 
table of contents further terrorist act  outbreak of hostilities or escalation of war would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
an outbreak of highly infectious disease could adversely affect the number of visitors to our facilities and disrupt our operations  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  taiwan  china  hong kong  singapore and certain other regions experienced an outbreak of a new and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
as a result of the outbreak  there was a decrease in travel to and from  and economic activity in  affected regions  including macao 
in addition  there have been recent fears concerning the spread of an avian flu in asia 
potential future outbreaks of sars  avian flu or other highly infectious diseases may adversely affect the number of visitors to the sands macao  the venetian  the sands expo center and other properties we are developing in las vegas or macao and our business and prospects 
furthermore  an outbreak might disrupt our ability to adequately staff our business and could generally disrupt our operations 
if any of our customers or employees is suspected of having contracted certain highly contagious diseases  we may be required to quarantine these customers or employees or the affected areas of our facilities and temporarily suspend part or all of our operations at affected facilities 
any new outbreak of such a highly infectious disease could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there are significant risks associated with our planned construction projects  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows from these planned facilities 
our ongoing and future construction projects  such as the palazzo and the venetian macao  entail significant risks 
construction activity requires us to obtain qualified contractors and subcontractors  the availability of which may be uncertain 
construction projects are subject to cost overruns and delays caused by events outside of our control or  in certain cases  our contractors control  such as shortages of materials or skilled labor  unforeseen engineering  environmental and or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases and unavailability of construction materials or equipment 
construction  equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite materials  licenses  permits  allocations and authorizations from governmental or regulatory authorities could increase the total cost  delay  jeopardize or prevent the construction or opening of such projects or otherwise affect the design and features of the palazzo and the venetian macao or other projects 
we have not entered into a fixed price or guaranteed maximum price contract with a single construction manager or general contractor for the construction of the palazzo or the venetian macao 
as a result  we will rely heavily on our in house development and construction team to manage construction costs and coordinate the work of the various trade contractors 
the lack of any fixed price contract with a construction manager or general contractor will put more of the risk of cost overruns on us 
if we are unable to manage costs or we are unable to raise additional capital required to complete the palazzo or the venetian macao  we may not be able to open or complete these projects  which may have an adverse impact on our business and prospects for growth 
the anticipated costs and completion dates for the palazzo and the venetian macao are based on budgets  designs  development and construction documents and schedule estimates that we have prepared with the assistance of architects and that are subject to change as the design  development and construction documents are finalized and more actual construction work is performed 
a failure to complete the palazzo or the venetian macao on budget or on schedule may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risks associated with our international operations we are required to build and open the venetian macao and a convention center by december unless we meet this deadline or obtain an extension  we may lose our right to continue to operate the sands macao or any other facilities developed under the subconcession 
we are finalizing commitments for a billion facility for the partial financing of the sands macao expansion  the venetian macao and our other cotai strip developments  but we do not yet have any 
table of contents commitments for that financing 
a significant portion of the sands macao s cash flows will also be used to finance the construction of the venetian macao 
if the sands macao s cash flows are not sufficient  or if this contemplated credit facility is not obtained  additional equity or debt financings may be needed to finance the remainder of the construction of the venetian macao 
in addition  this credit facility will not cover all of the costs of our other cotai strip developments 
we have not yet finalized our plans for all our cotai strip developments or our estimate of the costs of all these developments 
we expect that the construction of the other cotai strip developments will require significant additional debt and or equity financings 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will obtain all the financing required for the construction and opening of the sands macao expansion  the venetian macao or our other cotai strip developments 
in addition  the debt agreements into which las vegas sands  llc and its subsidiaries have entered to fund the construction of the palazzo contain significant conditions that must be satisfied in order for las vegas sands  llc and its subsidiaries to be able to use the proceeds available under these facilities  including having sufficient funds available so that construction costs of the palazzo are in balance for purposes of the debt instruments  obtaining various consents and other agreements from third parties  including trade contractors  and other customary conditions 
the failure to obtain the necessary financing  or satisfy these funding conditions  could adversely affect our ability to construct the palazzo  the venetian macao and our other planned cotai strip developments 
because we are currently dependent upon three properties in two markets for all of our cash flow  we will be subject to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties or that operates in more markets 
we currently do not have material assets or operations other than the venetian  the sands expo center and the sands macao 
as a result  we will be entirely dependent upon these properties for all of our cash flow until we complete the development of other properties 
given that our operations are currently conducted at two properties in las vegas and one property in macao and that a large portion of our planned future development is in las vegas and macao  we will be subject to greater degrees of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties in more markets 
the risks to which we will have a greater degree of exposure include the following local economic and competitive conditions  inaccessibility due to inclement weather  road construction or closure of primary access routes  decline in air passenger traffic due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel  changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations  including gaming laws and regulations  natural and other disasters  including the risk of typhoons in the south china region or outbreaks of infectious diseases  an increase in the cost of electrical power for the venetian and the sands expo center as a result of  among other things  power shortages in california or other western states with which nevada shares a single regional power grid  and a decline in the number of visitors to las vegas or macao 
our substantial debt could impair our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   on a pro forma basis assuming all of the million phase ii mall construction loan had been fully drawn  we would 
table of contents have had approximately billion of indebtedness outstanding 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million of available borrowings under the million revolving credit facility of las vegas sands  llc s senior secured credit facility 
we expect to incur billion of additional debt under a new credit facility for the partial funding of the sands macao expansion and the construction of the venetian macao and our other cotai strip developments 
because a portion of the sands macao s cash flows is also expected to be used to finance the construction of the venetian macao  we may need to incur additional debt to finance the venetian macao if the sands macao s cash flows are not sufficient 
in addition  we also expect that our other cotai strip developments will be financed in large part by additional debt 
see there are significant risks associated with our planned construction projects  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows from these planned facilities 
this substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  development projects  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce the funds available for our operations  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and subject us to higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates to the extent a portion of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 
the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to finance additional growth  respond to changes or take certain actions 
our and our subsidiaries current debt instruments contain  and any future debt instruments  including the debt instruments for the financing of the venetian macao and our other cotai strip developments  likely will contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us or our subsidiaries 
las vegas sands  llc s senior secured credit facility includes  and the proposed new credit facility for the construction of the venetian macao is expected to include  covenants restricting  among other things  the ability of las vegas sands  llc or vml  respectively  to incur additional debt  including guarantees or credit support  incur liens securing indebtedness  dispose of assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments  such as purchasing equity interests  repurchasing junior indebtedness or making investments in third parties  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in any new businesses  
table of contents issue preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates 
las vegas sands  llc s senior secured credit facility also includes financial covenants  including requirements that las vegas sands  llc satisfy a minimum consolidated net worth test  a maximum consolidated capital expenditure test  a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio 
vml s proposed new credit facility for the construction of the venetian macao is also expected to include financial covenants  including requirements that vml satisfy a minimum consolidated ebitda test for a period of time  and from and after certain construction and operational thresholds are met  a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test  and a maximum consolidated capital expenditure test 
the indenture governing our million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes also restricts  among other things  our ability to incur liens and enter into certain sale and lease back transactions 
our future debt or other contracts could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable under the above instruments 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future 
although we have all risk property insurance for the venetian  the sands expo center and the sands macao covering damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire and natural disasters  each such policy has certain exclusions 
in addition  our property insurance coverage for the venetian and the sands expo center is in an amount that is significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the complex if there was a total loss 
our level of insurance coverage for the venetian and the sands expo center may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  certain casualty events  such as labor strikes  nuclear events  acts of war  loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism  deterioration or corrosion  insect or animal damage and pollution  might not be covered at all under our policies 
therefore  certain acts could expose us to heavy  uninsured losses 
we also have builder s risk insurance for the palazzo and the venetian macao that provides coverage during their construction for damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire and natural disasters 
in general  our builder s risk coverage is subject to the same exclusions  risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
our level of builder s risk insurance coverage for the palazzo and the venetian macao may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  delays occasioned by major casualty events may adversely affect our ability to meet the deadlines imposed by the macao government to complete the venetian macao and the convention center we are building in macao 
we are not insured against this risk 
in addition  although we currently have insurance coverage for occurrences of terrorist acts with respect to the venetian  the sands expo center and the sands macao and for certain losses that could result from these acts  our terrorism coverage is subject to the same risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
the lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses in the event that any damages occur  directly or indirectly  as a result of terrorist attacks or otherwise  which could have a significant negative impact on our operations 

table of contents in addition to the damage caused to our property by a casualty loss such as fire  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties injured or harmed 
while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance  this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event 
we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis 
the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 
among other factors  it is possible that the situation in iraq  homeland security concerns  other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits and additional exclusions from coverage 
among other potential future adverse changes  in the future we may elect to not  or may not be able to  obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism 
our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements 
see risks associated with our international operations the macao government can terminate our subconcession under certain circumstances without compensation to us  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on the continued services of key managers and employees 
if we do not retain our key personnel or attract and retain other highly skilled employees  our business will suffer 
our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the services of our senior management team  including mr 
adelson 
mr 
adelson  william p 
weidner  bradley h 
stone  robert g 
goldstein  scott d 
henry and bradley k 
serwin have each entered into employment agreements 
however  we cannot assure you that any of these individuals will remain with us 
we currently do not have a life insurance policy on any of the members of the senior management team 
the death or loss of the services of any of our senior managers or the inability to attract and retain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are controlled by a principal stockholder whose interest in our business may be different than yours 
mr 
adelson and trusts for the benefit of mr 
adelson and or his family members beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on february   we filed a registration statement on form s for an underwritten secondary stock offering of million shares by certain trusts for the benefit of mr 
adelson and his family 
mr 
adelson and trusts for the benefit of mr 
adelson and or his family members will beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock following the completion of the offering excluding options and assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
accordingly  mr 
adelson exercises significant influence over our business policies and affairs  including the composition of our board of directors and any action requiring the approval of our stockholders  including the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets 
the concentration of ownership may also delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of mr 
adelson 
because mr 
adelson and trusts for the benefit of mr 
adelson and or his family members own more than of the voting power of our company  we are considered a controlled company under the new york stock exchange listing standards 
as such  the nyse corporate governance requirements that our board of directors and our compensation committee be independent do not apply to us 
as a result  the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced 
the interests of mr 
adelson may conflict with your interests 

table of contents we are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries 
we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own 
our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
accordingly  our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries that are derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
our subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future 
our subsidiaries payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations 
in addition  our subsidiaries debt instruments and other agreements  including las vegas sands  llc s senior secured credit facility  limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us 
we expect that the debt instruments for the financing of the venetian macao and our other cotai strip developments will contain similar restrictions 
we are currently in the development stage of several projects that are subject to a variety of contingencies that may ultimately prevent the realization of such plans 
we have several new projects in development  including building and operating six casino resort developments on the cotai strip in addition to the venetian macao 
these projects are subject to a number of contingencies 
for example  we cannot assure you that the macao government will approve our master plan for the development of those cotai properties or that we will raise all the financing required for the completion of these projects 
see there are significant risks associated with our planned construction projects  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows from these planned facilities 
in addition  although we expect that several of the hotel properties will be managed or developed by third parties  we cannot assure you that we will reach satisfactory agreements with third parties to manage or develop these properties 
we are also exploring opportunities for casino gaming operations in certain other domestic and foreign jurisdictions  such as singapore  the united kingdom and pennsylvania where we are participating in a joint venture to develop a gaming and retail complex in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
we are also exploring the development of a leisure and convention destination resort on hengqin island in china 
in a number of jurisdictions  such as the united kingdom  singapore and pennsylvania  current laws do not permit unlimited licenses for casino gaming of the type we propose to develop and we are competing for a limited number of available licenses 
these projects are subject to a number of contingencies  including  but not limited to  adverse developments in applicable legislation  our ability to procure necessary governmental licenses and or approvals  our ability to reach satisfactory  final agreements with necessary third parties or meet the conditions provided for thereunder  and our ability to raise sufficient financing to fund such projects 
in addition  luxury casino resort projects require substantial amounts of capital 
as a result  our various plans for the development of our operations may not ultimately be realized as currently planned  or at all 
even if we are successful in launching any of these ventures  we cannot assure you that any of these projects would be successful  or that their operations would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents risks associated with our las vegas operations we face significant competition in las vegas which could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and access to capital than we have and several of them are expanding or renovating their facilities 
in addition  any significant downturn in the trade show and convention business would significantly and adversely affect our mid week occupancy rates and business 
the hotel  resort and casino business in las vegas is highly competitive 
the venetian competes with a large number of major hotel casinos and a number of smaller casinos located on and near the las vegas strip and in and near las vegas 
competitors of the venetian include major resorts on the las vegas strip  such as the wynn las vegas resort  the bellagio  the mandalay bay resort casino and paris las vegas 
we also compete  to some extent  with other hotel casino facilities in nevada and in atlantic city  as well as hotel casinos and other resort facilities and vacation destinations elsewhere in the united states and around the world 
many of our competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large public companies and may have greater financial and other resources than we have 
in particular  the recent merger of mandalay resort group with mgm mirage and the recent acquisition of caesar s entertainment inc by harrah s entertainment created the world s two largest gaming companies 
according to the lvcva  there were approximately  hotel and motel rooms in las vegas as of december  various competitors on the las vegas strip are expanding and renovating their existing facilities 
for example  wynn resorts limited has recently announced plans to add a second hotel tower at the wynn las vegas resort which is expected to include approximately  rooms  consisting of approximately suites and approximately  guest rooms and additional casino  retail and convention space that is expected to open in the second half of in addition  a renovation and rebranding of the approximately  room aladdin is expected to be completed in october mgm mirage has also recently announced plans to develop and build a multi billion dollar urban complex known as project citycenter consisting of hotels and condominium towers  and casino and retail  dining and entertainment venues 
the first phase of project citycenter  is expected to open in boyd gaming corporation also recently announced plans to develop echelon place  a four hotel complex occupying acres on the las vegas strip and containing  guest rooms and suites 
the development is scheduled to open in a newly formed company  fontainebleau resorts  also plans to build a  room hotel and casino on the north end of the las vegas strip 
this project is expected to open in if demand for hotel rooms does not keep up with the increase in the number of hotel rooms  competitive pressures may cause reductions in average room rates 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
native american tribes in california are permitted to operate casinos with video gaming machines  black jack and house banked card games 
the governor of california has entered into compacts with numerous tribes in california and has announced the execution of a number of new compacts with no limits on the number of gaming machines which had been limited under the prior compacts 
the federal government has approved numerous compacts in california and casino style gaming is now legal on those tribal lands 
while the competitive impact on our operations in las vegas from the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california remains uncertain  the proliferation of gaming in california and other areas located near the venetian could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain states have legalized  and others may legalize  casino gaming in specific areas  including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers  such as new york  los angeles  san francisco and boston 
in october  the new york legislature approved a bill for expanded casino gaming on native american reservations and video lottery terminals at certain race tracks 
in and  maine and pennsylvania  respectively  approved legislation legalizing slot machines or similar electronic gaming devices at certain locations  although such legislation has not been implemented yet 
a number of states have permitted or are considering permitting gaming at racinos  on native american reservations and through expansion of state lotteries 
the current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to our las vegas 
table of contents facilities by attracting customers close to home and away from las vegas  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of the large number of trade shows and conventions held in las vegas  the sands expo center and the congress center provide recurring demand for mid week room nights for business travelers who attend these events 
the attendance level at the trade shows and conventions that we host contributes to our higher than average mid week occupancy rates 
the sands expo center and the congress center presently compete with other large convention centers  including convention centers in las vegas and other cities 
competition will be increasing for the congress center and the sands expo center as a result of planned additional convention and meeting facilities  as well as the enhancement or expansion of existing convention and meeting facilities  in las vegas 
the lvcc  an approximately million square foot convention and exhibition space facility  and the mandalay bay convention center  an approximately million square foot convention center  will continue to be major competitors of the sands expo center and will be able to solely host many large trade shows which had previously split space between the lvcc and the sands expo center 
in february  the lvcva approved an approximately million project to expand and upgrade the lvcc  which is expected to be completed in in addition  boyd gaming corporation s echelon place is expected to include approximately million square feet of convention and meeting space when it opens in moreover  management anticipates increased competition from the mgm grand hotel and casino and the mirage  which have significant conference and meeting facilities 
also  cities such as boston  orlando and pittsburgh are in the process of developing  or have announced plans to develop  convention centers and other meeting  trade and exhibition facilities that may materially adversely affect us 
to the extent that these competitors are able to capture a substantially larger portion of the trade show and convention business  there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the loss of our gaming license or our failure to comply with the extensive regulations that govern our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our gaming operations and the ownership of our securities are subject to extensive regulation by the nevada gaming commission  the nevada state gaming control board and the clark county liquor and gaming licensing board 
these gaming authorities have broad authority with respect to licensing and registration of our business entities and individuals investing in or otherwise involved with us 
although we currently are registered with  and las vegas sands  llc and venetian casino resort  llc currently hold gaming licenses issued by  the nevada gaming authorities  these authorities may  among other things  revoke the gaming license of any corporate entity or the registration of a registered corporation or any entity registered as a holding company of a corporate licensee for violations of gaming regulations 
in addition  the nevada gaming authorities may  under certain conditions  revoke the license or finding of suitability of any officer  director  controlling person  stockholder  noteholder or key employee of a licensed or registered entity 
if our gaming licenses were revoked for any reason  the nevada gaming authorities could require the closing of the casino  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  compliance costs associated with gaming laws  regulations or licenses are significant 
any change in the laws  regulations or licenses applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the nevada state gaming control board investigates or reviews the records of gaming companies for compliance with gaming regulations as part of its regular oversight functions

table of contents certain beneficial owners of our voting securities may be required to file an application with  and be investigated by  the nevada gaming authorities  and the nevada gaming commission may restrict the ability of a beneficial owner to receive any benefit from our voting securities and may require the disposition of shares of our voting securities  if a beneficial owner is found to be unsuitable 
any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than of our voting securities will be required to apply to the nevada gaming commission for a finding of suitability within days after the chairman of the nevada state gaming control board mails a written notice requiring the filing 
under certain circumstances  an institutional investor as defined under the regulations of the nevada gaming commission  which acquires beneficial ownership of more than but not more than of our voting securities  may apply to the nevada gaming commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability requirement if the institutional investor holds our voting securities only for investment purposes 
in addition  any beneficial owner of our voting securities  regardless of the number of shares beneficially owned  may be required at the discretion of the nevada gaming commission to file an application for a finding of suitability as such 
in either case  a finding of suitability is comparable to licensing and the applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the nevada gaming authorities in conducting the investigation 
any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability as a beneficial owner of our voting securities within days after being ordered to do so by the nevada gaming authorities may be found unsuitable 
any stockholder found unsuitable by the nevada gaming commission to be a beneficial owner of our voting securities and who continues to hold  directly or indirectly  beneficial ownership of our voting securities beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the nevada gaming commission may be guilty of a criminal offense 
we will be subject to disciplinary action if  after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a beneficial owner of our voting securities or to have any other relationship with us or a licensed subsidiary  we or any of the licensed subsidiaries pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities  allow that person to exercise  directly or indirectly  any voting right conferred through our voting securities held by that person  pay that person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise  or fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require that person to relinquish our voting securities for cash at fair market value

the construction and operation of the palazzo could have an adverse effect on the venetian 
we have commenced construction on the palazzo  which will consist of a hotel  casino  restaurant  dining and entertainment complex  and meeting and conference center space on an approximately acre site adjacent to the venetian 
although we intend to construct the palazzo with minimal impact on the venetian  we cannot guarantee that the construction will not disrupt the operations of the venetian or that it will be implemented as planned 
therefore  the construction of the palazzo may adversely impact the businesses  operations and revenues of the venetian 
we also cannot assure you that the palazzo will be as financially successful as the venetian 
if demand for the additional hotel rooms at the palazzo is not strong  the lack of demand may adversely affect the occupancy rates and room rates realized by us 
in addition  because the business concept for the palazzo is very similar to that of the venetian  there may not be enough demand to fill the combined hotel room capacity of the palazzo and the venetian 

table of contents our failure to substantially complete construction of the phase ii mall by an agreed upon deadline will result in our having to pay substantial liquidated damages and cause an event of default under our debt instruments 
under our agreement with ggp  we have agreed to substantially complete construction of the phase ii mall before the earlier of months after the date on which sufficient permits are received to begin construction of the phase ii mall and march  these dates may be extended due to force majeure or certain other delays 
in the event that we do not substantially complete construction of the phase ii mall on or before the earlier of these two dates as these dates may be extended as described in the preceding sentence  we must pay liquidated damages of  per day  for up to six months  until substantial completion increasing to  per day  for up to the next six months  if substantial completion does not occur by the end of six months after the completion deadline 
if substantial completion has not occurred on or before one year after the deadline  we will be required to pay total liquidated damages in the amount of million 
in addition  failure to substantially complete construction of the phase ii mall by the agreed upon deadline would constitute an event of default under las vegas sands  llc s senior secured credit facility and related disbursement agreement 
if we are unable to maintain an acceptable working relationship with ggp and or if ggp breaches any of its material agreements with us  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have entered into agreements with ggp under which  among other things ggp has agreed to purchase the phase ii mall from us  ggp has agreed to operate the grand canal shops mall subject to  and in accordance with  the cooperation agreement  leases for the phase ii mall  a joint opening date of the phase ii mall and the palazzo and certain aspects of the design of the phase ii mall must be jointly approved by us and ggp  and we lease from ggp certain office space and space located within the grand canal shops mall  in which we built the blue man group theater which opened in october and in which the canal and the gondola retail store are located 
each of the above described agreements with ggp could be adversely affected in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows if we do not maintain an acceptable working relationship with ggp 
for example if we are unable to agree with ggp on leases for the phase ii mall  the purchase price we will ultimately be paid for the phase ii mall could be substantially reduced  and there would  at least for a certain period of time  be an empty or partially empty mall within the palazzo  the success of the opening of the palazzo may be adversely affected if there is not an agreed upon joint opening date for the palazzo and the phase ii mall  completion of the construction of the phase ii mall would be delayed during any period of time that we are not in agreement with ggp as to certain design elements of the phase ii mall  and the cooperation agreement that will govern the relationship between the phase ii mall and the palazzo requires that the owners cooperate in various ways and take various joint actions  which will be more difficult to accomplish  especially in a cost effective manner  if the parties do not have an acceptable working relationship 
there could be similar material adverse consequences to us if ggp breaches any of its agreements to us  such as its agreement to purchase the phase ii mall from us  its agreement under the cooperation agreement to operate the grand canal shops mall consistent with the standards of first class restaurant and retail complexes and the overall venetian theme  and its various obligations as our landlord under the leases described above 
although the various agreements with ggp do provide us with various remedies in the event 
table of contents of any breaches by ggp and also include various dispute resolution procedures and mechanisms  these remedies  procedures and mechanisms may be inadequate to prevent a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition if breaches by ggp occur or if we do not maintain an acceptable working relationship with ggp 
we extend credit to a large portion of our customers  and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players 
we conduct our gaming activities on a credit basis as well as a cash basis 
this credit is unsecured 
table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players  and high stakes players typically are extended more credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts 
high end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming  and variances in win loss results attributable to high end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter 
at the venetian  credit play is significant while at the sands macao table games play is primarily cash play 
we extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant  in the opinion of management  an extension of credit 
for the year ended december   our table games drop at the venetian was approximately from credit based guest wagering 
the default rate on credit extended to our table gaming customers at the venetian was approximately of the total amount of credit for the three years ended december  in the past  individual gaming receivables have ranged as high as million for a single player 
these large receivables could have a significant impact on our operating results if deemed uncollectible 
while gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument  including what is commonly referred to as a marker  and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada  and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution  other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy 
although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment  judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 
risks associated with our international operations conducting business in macao has certain political and economic risks which may affect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of our asian operations 
we currently own and operate a casino in macao and are developing and plan to operate one or more hotels  additional casinos and convention centers in macao  including the venetian macao 
accordingly  our business development plans  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by significant political  social and economic developments in macao and throughout the rest of china and by changes in policies of the government or changes in laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof 
our operations in macao are also exposed to the risk of changes in laws and policies that govern operations of macao based companies 
tax laws and regulations may also be subject to amendment or different interpretation and implementation  thereby adversely affecting our profitability after tax 
further  the percentage of our gross gaming revenues that we must contribute annually to the macao authorities is subject to change in these changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as we expect a significant number of consumers to come to the sands macao and the venetian macao from china  general economic conditions and policies in china could have a significant impact on our financial prospects 
any slowdown in economic growth or reversal of china s current policies of liberalizing restrictions on travel and currency movements could adversely impact the number of visitors from china to our macao properties as well as the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino 
current macao laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are  for the most part  fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations 
we believe that 
table of contents our organizational structure and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations of macao 
however  these laws and regulations are complex and a court or an administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations  or issue regulations  that differ from our interpretation  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  our activities in macao are subject to administrative review and approval by various agencies of the macao government 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals  which may materially affect our long term business strategy and operations 
macao law permits redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions 
however  such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues 
we are required to build and open the venetian macao and a convention center by december unless we meet this deadline or obtain an extension  we may lose our right to continue to operate the sands macao or any other facilities developed under the subconcession 
under our subconcession agreement  we are obligated to develop and open the venetian macao and a convention center by december construction of the venetian macao is subject to significant development and construction risks  including construction  equipment and staffing problems or delays and difficulties in obtaining required materials  licenses  permits and authorizations from governmental regulatory authorities  not all of which have been obtained 
construction projects are subject to cost overruns and delays caused by events not within our control or  in certain cases  our contractors control  such as shortages of materials or skilled labor  unforeseen engineering  environmental and or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases and unavailability of construction materials or equipment 
we currently have no commitment for the financing of the venetian macao or our other cotai strip developments 
in addition  our ability to incur additional debt or to make investments in the entity constructing the venetian macao is limited under the terms of the debt instruments of las vegas sands llc and may prevent us from fulfilling our construction obligations 
see risks related to our business the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to finance additional growth  respond to changes or take some actions and risks related to our business there are significant risks associated with our planned construction projects  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows from these planned facilities 
we are currently scheduled to open the venetian macao in mid we have recently received an extension of the original completion deadline from the macao authorities 
although we believe that we will be able to complete these projects by the december deadline or obtain another extension of the deadline  if we fail to do so  the macao government has the right  after consultation with our concessionaire  galaxy  to unilaterally terminate our subconcession to operate the sands macao or any of our other casino operations in macao  without compensation to us 
the loss of our subconcession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in macao  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are constructing the venetian macao on land for which we have not yet been granted a concession 
if we do not obtain a land concession  we could forfeit all or a part of our investment in the site and construction of the venetian macao and would not be able to open and operate that facility as planned 
land concessions in macao generally have terms of years  with automatic extensions of years thereafter and there are common formulas generally used to determine the cost of these land concessions 
we have not yet obtained a land concession from the macao government for the site of the venetian macao which we are currently constructing and the four season hotel 
we are currently in the process of negotiating with the macao government to obtain the land concession 
we believe that the delay in obtaining this land concession is due to the fact that we have not yet submitted to the macao government complete detailed plans for the development of all portions of this site 
although there can be no certainty  we expect to finalize our negotiations with the government and obtain a land concession for the site of the venetian macao and the four seasons soon after we finalize and submit to the macao government our development plans for the entire site 

table of contents if we do not obtain a land concession for the site of the venetian macao and the four seasons hotel  we will not be able to open and operate these projects 
we have made significant investments in building the site for  and in constructing  the venetian macao and could lose all or a substantial part of this investment if we do not obtain a land concession 
we also cannot assure you that we will obtain a land concession on favorable economic terms or at all 
the macao government can terminate our subconcession under certain circumstances without compensation to us  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the macao government has the right  after consultation with galaxy  to unilaterally terminate our subconcession in the event of serious non compliance by vml with its basic obligations under the subconcession and applicable macao laws 
the following reasons for termination are included in the subconcession the operation of gaming without permission or operation of business which does not fall within the business scope of the subconcession  suspension of operations of our gaming business in macao without reasonable grounds for more than seven consecutive days or more than non consecutive days within one calendar year  unauthorized transfer of all or part of our gaming operations in macao  failure to pay taxes  premiums  levies or other amounts payable to the macao government  failure to resume operations following the temporary assumption of operations by the macao government  repeated failure to comply with decisions of the macao government  failure to provide or supplement the guarantee deposit or the guarantees specified in the subconcession within the prescribed period  bankruptcy or insolvency of vml  fraudulent activity by vml  serious and repeated violation by vml of the applicable rules for carrying out casino games of chance or games of other forms or the operation of casino games of chance or games of other forms  the grant to any other person of any managing power over vml  or failure by a controlling shareholder in vml to dispose of its interest in vml following notice from the gaming authorities of another jurisdiction in which such controlling shareholder is licensed to operate casino games of chance to the effect that such controlling shareholder can no longer own shares in vml 
these events could lead to the termination of our subconcession without compensation to us regardless of whether they occurred with respect to us or with respect to our affiliates who will operate our macao properties 
upon such termination  all of our casino gaming operations and related equipment in macao would be automatically transferred to the macao government without compensation to us and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations 
in many of these instances  the subconcession agreement does not provide a specific cure period within which any such events may be cured and  instead  we would rely on consultations and negotiations with the macao government to give us an opportunity to remedy any such default 
in addition  the subconcession agreement contains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions  the determination as to compliance with which is subjective 
we cannot assure you that we will perform such covenants in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macao government and  accordingly  we will be dependent on our continuing communications and good faith negotiations with the macao government to ensure that we are performing our obligations under the subconcession in a manner that would avoid a default thereunder 

table of contents our subconcession also allows the macao government to request various changes in the plans and specifications of our macao properties and to make various other decisions and determinations that may be binding on us 
for example  the macao government has the right to require that we contribute additional capital to our macao subsidiaries or that we provide certain deposits or other guarantees of performance in any amount determined by the macao government to be necessary 
vml is limited in its ability to raise additional capital by the need to first obtain the approval of the macao gaming and governmental authorities before raising certain debt or equity 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these requirements or any other requirements of the macao government or with the other requirements and obligations imposed by our subconcession 
furthermore  pursuant to the subconcession agreement  we are obligated to comply not only with the terms of that agreement  but also with laws and regulations that the macao government might promulgate in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with any such order or that any such order would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macao properties 
if any disagreement arises between us and the macao government regarding the interpretation of  or our compliance with  a provision of the subconcession agreement  we will be relying on the consultation process with the applicable macao governmental agency described above 
during any such consultation  however  we will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession agreement as interpreted by the macao government 
our failure to comply with the terms of our subconcession in a manner satisfactory to the macao government could result in the termination of our subconcession 
under our subconcession  we would not be compensated if the macao government decided to terminate the subconcession because of our failure to perform 
the loss of our subconcession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in macao  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we will stop generating any revenues from our macao gaming operations if we cannot secure an extension of our subconcession in or if the macao government exercises its redemption right in our subconcession agreement expires on june  unless our subconcession is extended  on that date  all of our casino operations and related equipment in macao will be automatically transferred to the macao government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations 
beginning on december   the macao government may redeem the subconcession agreement by providing us at least one year prior notice 
in the event the macao government exercises this redemption right  we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity 
the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or extend our subconcession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all 
we also cannot assure you that if our subconcession is redeemed  the compensation paid will be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues 
our macao operations face intense competition  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the hotel  resort and casino businesses are highly competitive 
our macao operations currently compete with numerous other casinos located in macao 
in addition  we expect competition to increase in the near future from local and foreign casino operators 
sjm  which currently operates gaming facilities in macao  had a commitment to invest at least billion patacas approximately million at exchange rates in effect on december  in gaming  entertainment and related projects in macao by march  these projects include the upgrade of the lisboa hotel  macao s largest hotel with approximately  rooms  the fisherman s wharf entertainment complex  which opened on december   and a potential new casino hotel project

wynn macau also has announced plans to build up to three resorts on the cotai strip but has not yet publicly provided details of these proposed projects 
sjm competes  and wynn macau will compete  directly with our macao operations 
under its concession  galaxy is also obligated to invest billion patacas approximately million at exchange rates in effect on december  in development projects in macao by june galaxy currently operates one small casino in macao 
we will also compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in asia  such as malaysia s genting highlands  as well as gaming venues in australia  new zealand and elsewhere in the world  including las vegas 
in addition  certain countries have legalized  and others may in the future legalize  casino gaming  including hong kong  singapore  japan  taiwan and thailand 
we also expect competition from cruise ships operating out of hong kong and other areas of asia that offer gaming 
the proliferation of gaming venues in southeast asia could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the macao government could grant additional rights to conduct gaming in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we hold a subconcession under one of only three gaming concessions authorized by the macao government to operate casinos in macao 
the macao government is precluded from granting any additional gaming concessions until however  we cannot assure you that the laws will not change and permit the macao government to grant additional gaming concessions before in addition  the macao government may permit existing concessionaires to grant subconcessions 
in april  mgm mirage s joint venture obtained a subconcession under sjm s existing concession allowing it to conduct gaming operations in macao 
if the macao government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macao through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions  we would face additional competition  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may not be able to attract and retain professional staff necessary for our existing and future properties in macao 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  train  manage and motivate skilled employees 
there is significant competition in macao for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer and competition for such persons is likely to increase 
there can be no assurance that a sufficient number of skilled employees will continue to be available  or that we will be successful in training  retaining and motivating current or future employees 
if we are unable to attract  retain and train skilled employees  our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing and planned casino and resort properties in macao could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we are dependent upon gaming junket operators for a significant portion of our gaming revenues in macao 
junket operators  who organize tours  or junkets  for high roller customers to casinos  are responsible for a significant portion of our gaming revenues in macao 
with the rise in gaming in macao  the competition for relationships with junket operators has increased 
while we are undertaking initiatives to strengthen our relationships with our current junket operators  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain  or grow  our relationships with junket operators 
if we are unable to maintain or grow our relationships with junket operators  our ability to grow our gaming revenues will be hampered and we will have to seek alternative ways to develop relationships with high roller customers  which may not be as profitable as our junket programs 
in addition  the quality of junket operators is important to our reputation and our ability to continue to operate in compliance with our gaming licenses 
while we strive for excellence in our associations with junket operators  we cannot assure you that the junket operators with whom we are associated will meet the high standards we insist upon 
if a junket operator falls below our standards  we may suffer reputational harm  as well as worsening relationships with  and possibly sanctions from  gaming regulators with authority over our operations 
our business could be adversely affected by the limitations of the pataca exchange markets and restrictions on the export of the renminbi 
our revenues in macao are denominated in patacas  the legal currency of macao  and hong kong dollars 
although currently permitted  we cannot assure you that patacas will continue to be freely exchangeable into us dollars 
also  because the currency market for patacas is relatively small and undeveloped  our ability to convert large amounts of patacas into us dollars over a relatively short period may be limited 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in converting patacas into us dollars 
we are currently prohibited from accepting wagers in renminbi  the currency of china 
there are currently restrictions on the export of the renminbi outside of mainland china  including to macao 
restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers from china to macao  inhibit the growth of gaming in macao and negatively impact our gaming operations 
on july   the people s bank of china announced that the renminbi will no longer be pegged to the us dollar  but will be allowed to float in a band and  to a limited extent  increase in value against a basket of foreign currencies 
the macao pataca is pegged to the hong kong dollar 
certain asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar and the macao pataca will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or that the current peg rate for these currencies will remain at the same level 
the floating of the renminbi and possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies 
any change in such exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on certain of our debt instruments 
we do not currently hedge for foreign currency risk 
certain gaming laws apply to our planned gaming activities and associations in other jurisdictions where we operate or plan to operate 
certain nevada gaming laws also apply to our gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the state of nevada 
we are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning our proposed gaming activities and associations occurring outside the state of nevada  including macao and other jurisdictions 
we will also be subject to disciplinary action by the nevada gaming commission if we knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation  fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of nevada gaming operations  
table of contents engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in nevada  reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the state of nevada or gaming in nevada  or is contrary to the gaming policies of nevada  engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the state of nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees  or employ  contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability  or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling 
in addition  if the nevada state gaming control board determines that one of our actual or intended activities or associations in a foreign gaming operation may violate one or more of the foregoing  we can be required by it to file an application with the nevada gaming commission for a finding of suitability of such activity or association 
if the nevada gaming commission finds that the activity or association in the foreign gaming operation is unsuitable or prohibited  we will either be required to terminate the activity or association  or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association 
consequently  should the nevada gaming commission find that our gaming activities or associations in macao or certain other jurisdictions where we operate are unsuitable  we may be prohibited from undertaking our planned gaming activities or associations in those jurisdictions 
the macao gaming authorities exercise similar powers for purposes of assessing suitability in relation to our activities in jurisdictions outside of macao 
we may not be able to monetize some of our real estate assets 
part of our business strategy in macao relies upon our ability to profitably operate and or sell certain of our real estate assets once developed  including vacation suites and retail malls  and to use the proceeds of these operations and sales to refinance in part our construction loans for these assets  as well as to provide investment capital for additional development both in macao and elsewhere 
our ability to sell these assets will be subject to market conditions  the receipt of necessary government approvals and other factors 
if we are unable to profitably operate and or monetize these real estate assets  we will have to seek alternative sources of capital to refinance in part our construction loans and for other investment capital 
these alternative sources of capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
vml may have financial and other obligations to foreign workers hired by its contractors under government labor quotas 
the macao government has granted vml a quota to permit it to hire foreign workers 
vml has effectively allocated this quota to its contractors for the construction of the venetian macao and other projects on the cotai strip 
vml  however  remains ultimately liable for all employer obligations relating to these employees  including for payment of wages and taxes and compliance with labor and workers compensation laws 
vml requires each contractor to whom it has allocated part of its labor quota to indemnify vml for any costs or liabilities vml incurs as a result of such contractor s failure to fulfill employer obligations 
vml s agreements with its contractors also contain provisions that permit it to retain some payments for up to one year after the contractors complete work on the projects 
we cannot assure you that vml s contractors will fulfill their obligations to employees hired under the labor quotas or to vml under the indemnification agreements  or that the amount of any indemnification will be sufficient to pay for any obligations vml may owe to employees hired by contractors under vml s quotas 
until we make final payments to our contractors  we have offset rights to collect amounts they may owe us  including amounts owed under the indemnities relating to employer obligations 
after we have made the final payments  it may be more difficult for us to enforce any unpaid indemnity obligations 

table of contents the transportation infrastructure in macao may need to be expanded to meet increased visitation in macao 
macao is in the process of expanding its transportation infrastructure to service the increased number of visitors to macao 
if the planned expansions of transportation facilities to and from macao are delayed or not completed  and macao s transportation infrastructure is insufficient to meet the demands of an increased volume of visitors to macao  the desirability of macao as a gaming and tourist destination  as well as the results of operations of our macao properties  could be negatively impacted 
we are currently not required to pay corporate income taxes on our casino gaming operations in macao 
this tax exemption expires at the end of and may not be extended 
we have had the benefit of a corporate tax holiday in macao  effective may   which exempts us from paying corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games 
we will continue to benefit from this tax exemption through the end of we cannot assure you that this tax exemption will be extended beyond the expiration date and we do not expect this tax exemption to apply to our non gaming activities once the venetian macao and our other cotai strip properties open 
macao is susceptible to severe typhoons that may disrupt operations 
macao is susceptible to severe typhoons 
macao consists of a peninsula and two islands off the coast of mainland china 
on some occasions  typhoons have caused a considerable amount of damage to macao s infrastructure and economy 
in the event of a major typhoon or other natural disaster in macao  our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
although we have insurance coverage with respect to these events  we cannot assure you that our coverage will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against all direct and indirect costs  including loss of business  that could result from substantial damage to  or partial or complete destruction of  our macao properties or other damage to the infrastructure or economy of macao

we purchased an insurance policy for loss coverage in connection with all litigation relating to the construction of the venetian the insurance policy 
under the insurance policy  we self insured the first million of covered losses excluding defense costs and the insurance company the insurer insured defense costs and other covered losses up to the next million 
the principal exclusions from coverage under the insurance policy are lien claims of bovis subcontractors directly against the company direct claims and the lido claims 
during the year ended december   we paid million and million to resolve the lido claims and three direct claims  respectively  parts of which were applied to the million self insured retention amount
