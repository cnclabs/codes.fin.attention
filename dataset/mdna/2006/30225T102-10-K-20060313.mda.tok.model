overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  formed to continue the business commenced in by our predecessor companies to own  operate  acquire  develop and redevelop professionally managed self storage properties 
since  our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than self storage properties 
in july  we  along with joint venture partner prudential real estate investors prei  acquired storage usa susa from ge commercial finance for approximately billion in cash 
the transaction  the largest to date in the self storage industry  made us the second largest operator of self storage facilities in the united states with properties owned or managed in states including washington  dc as of december   of our properties were wholly owned  we held joint venture interests in properties  and our taxable reit subsidiary  extra space management  inc  operated an additional properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee 
the properties that we own or in which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately  units and currently serve a customer base of  tenants 
the susa acquisition gives us a national platform upon which to leverage operational  advertising and other economic efficiencies 
the acquisition also creates a built in acquisition pipeline through various joint venture  franchise and third party management partners from which we can grow in the future 
we have also been able to retain several key executives from the susa organization  as well as the majority of its field operations team 
to maximize the performance of our properties  we employ a state of the art  proprietary  web based tracking and yield management technology called store 
developed by our management team  store enables us to analyze  set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions 
as part of the susa acquisition  we gained access to susa s industry leading revenue management team revman  which managed susa s rental rate and discount strategies 
we believe that the combination of store s yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by revman will allow us to more proactively manage revenue in the future 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our self storage properties and from management fees on the properties we manage for joint venture partners  franchisees and unaffiliated third parties 
this management fee is equal to approximately of total revenues generated by the managed properties 
we operate in competitive markets  often where consumers have multiple self storage properties from which to choose 
competition has impacted  and will continue to impact our property results 
we experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels  with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity 
our operating results  therefore  depend materially on our ability to lease available self storage space  to actively manage unit rental rates  and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments 
we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local  regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store  the operating management software employed at the properties and through the use of the process developed by revman 
we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value 
our strategies to maximize stockholder value include maximize cash flow at our properties we seek to maximize revenue generating opportunities by responding to changing local market conditions through interactive yield management of the rental rates at our properties 
pursue opportunities to acquire self storage portfolios we intend to continue to selectively acquire  for cash or by utilizing op units as acquisition currency  privately held self storage portfolios and single self storage assets in high population density areas 
strategically select and develop sites we plan to continue to expand by selecting and developing new self storage properties through joint ventures 
continue our joint venture strategy to pursue development opportunities and enhance returns we plan to grow by continuing our development activities in conjunction with our joint venture partners thus mitigating the risks normally associated with early stage development and lease up activities 
where appropriate  we plan to also seek to acquire properties in a capital efficient manner in conjunction with our joint venture partners 
during we acquired wholly owned properties and minority equity interests in additional properties 
we completed the development of six properties in our core markets including two expansions of wholly owned properties 
one of these development properties is owned by us in a joint venture  and the other three properties are owned by extra space development  an entity in which we do not have any ownership interest  but which is owned by certain members of senior management 
these joint venture and third party development properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future 
thirteen properties are scheduled for completion in  eight of which will be owned by us in a joint venture format 
as of december   we operated properties located in states including washington  dc of the properties  are wholly owned  are held in joint ventures with third parties  and an additional properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and managed by us in exchange for a management fee 
the properties are generally situated in convenient  highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as baltimore washington dc  boston  chicago  dallas  las vegas  los angeles  miami  new york city  orlando  philadelphia  phoenix  st 
petersburg tampa and san francisco 
these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels and high barriers to entry for new self storage properties 
the clustering of our assets around these population centers  which has intensified following the susa acquisition  enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale 
we consider a property to be in the lease up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy  but before it has achieved stabilization 
a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate or has been open for three years 
in the results of operations discussion below  we will compare the results of our operations for the year ended december  with historical results of operations for the predecessor for the period from january  through august  and with our historical results of operations for the period from august  through december  comparisons to any prior periods are to the historical results of the operations of the predecessor 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
consolidation we follow fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
under fin r  arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
under fin r  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or ii the entity s equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur  or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin r  the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
based on the provisions of fin r  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit  or ii enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures  a vie may be created under condition ii b or c of the previous paragraph 
for each vie created  we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin r 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements 
real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development  construction  renovation  and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized 
interest  property taxes  and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements  which are generally between and years 
in connection with our acquisition of properties  the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the value of the tangible assets  consisting of land and buildings  are determined as if vacant  that is  at replacement cost 
intangible assets  which represent the value of existing tenant relationships  are recorded at their estimated fair values 
we measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in its facilities 
we amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a straight line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility currently estimated to be months 
intangible lease rights represent purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases 
these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the lease 
evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
if such events occur  we compare the carrying value of these long lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset 
when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value  net of selling costs 
if the estimated fair value  net of selling costs  of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets  then a valuation allowance is established 
the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures  where we have significant influence  but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under the equity method  our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions 
equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures 
for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows  we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures 
under this approach  distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg  a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture s sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 
our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
an investment is impaired if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value 
to the extent impairment has occurred  and it is considered to be other than temporary  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income loss  outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock  when converted under the original provisions of the agreement  is accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 implementation issues related to the treatment of minority interest in certain real estate investment trusts 
revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants 
leases are generally on month to month terms 
prepaid rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
property expenses  including utilities  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and other cost to manage the facilities are recorded as incurred 
management and franchise fee revenue and tenant insurance revenue are recognized when earned 
development and acquisition fee revenue is recognized ratably as development costs are incurred 
real estate sales we evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
in general  sales of real estate and related profits losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition  other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  among other things  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets 
as a reit  we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income  which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders 
we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
we are subject to certain state and local taxes 
provision for such taxes has been included in real estate and other taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
we have elected to treat certain of our existing and newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries trs 
in general  our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no

ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis 
we believe that to further understand our performance  ffo should be considered along with the reported net loss and cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance  as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activates as a measure of our liquidity  or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions

the increase in is primarily the result of the  of cash paid in the acquisition of storage usa

operational summary proved to be both a rewarding and challenging year for us 
during the course of the year  we became the second largest operator of self storage in the united states with the acquisition of susa  and faced the expected challenges of a complex integration while attempting to maximize operational performance in a competitive marketplace 
the susa acquisition took center stage in and commanded a majority of our efforts throughout the year  especially during the second and third quarters 
our operating results were positive  as revenue levels increased compared to those seen in however  our operational performance lagged internal expectations during the first six months of due to the resources required to close and integrate the susa acquisition 
operational performance improved significantly in the last six months of the year  largely due to the impact of the newly acquired susa properties and more aggressive pricing and discounting strategies instituted by revman 
mission critical business processes were completed shortly after the closing of the transaction  and the majority of the integration has been completed 
as a result of completing this integration  we are hopeful that the recent performance trend will continue 
the florida and california markets were among our strongest performing markets  both before and after the susa acquisition 
after the acquisition  our newly strengthened markets of phoenix  las vegas and washington dc were also recognized for their strong revenue growth 
metro chicago  michigan  new jersey  ohio and pennsylvania were among our weakest performing markets 
competitive pressure remains a factor to performance 
however  due to the strength of self storage fundamentals in many markets  the ability to raise rental rates continues to be evident 
despite these increases  many competitors are continuing with high levels of rental discounts  which act as a drag on revenue 
on a same store basis for our pre susa  legacy properties  we experienced increased rental activity compared to  while move out activity was slightly lower 
the susa properties experienced increased rental activity compared to  while move out activity was slightly lower 
outlook we anticipate continued strength in self storage fundamentals due to positive economic conditions in many of our core markets 
we believe that the ability to increase revenues in over levels achieved in exists 
we have seen improvement in our recent year on year performance with both occupancy and revenue 
though there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  we believe that positive economic conditions  the quality and location of our property portfolio and the combination of technology and revman  with its ability to implement real time pricing and promotions  will provide us with the opportunity to grow revenues in we anticipate continued competition from all operators  both public and private  in all of the markets in which we operate 
despite this  we expect a positive operating environment for self storage operators  particularly for those with well located  highly visible  and efficiently managed self storage properties 
we will continue to enhance operational processes and implement technology to maximize our effectiveness as an operator 
revenue outlook increased revenues were seen by many operators in this was also true for us  as was illustrated by positive same store revenue growth 
the ability for us to leverage revman and our technology platform gives us a positive revenue outlook for we aim to achieve not the highest level of occupancy  but the highest sustainable level of revenue to increase stockholder value 
this may mean lower occupancy levels when compared on a year on year basis 
we will also selectively discount certain sites and units based on occupancy  availability  and competitive parameters that are controlled through our point of sale software and revman 
rental discounts were flat in on our same store portfolio compared to and remains an important factor for us 
our evolving system of analyzing different data as it relates to site performance  competitive variables and operational experience will drive site level and portfolio performance in the future 
the ability to proactively control discounts also rests upon the site management team  and we are developing several initiatives to assist our field personnel in this regard 
with the acquisition of susa and our increased scale  advertising opportunities that only a few self storage companies currently possess are now available to us 
we will continue to look at communication tools that stretch marketing dollars further while investigating marketing channels to better communicate our services to prospective customers 
online marketing and commercial sales are two marketing programs that will be much more prominent in  especially since the acquisition of susa 
these programs were heavily utilized at susa  and we believe that they will have a positive affect on our ability to maximize revenues over time 
expense outlook property taxes  utilities and repairs and maintenance were the main components of s increased operating expenses 
as we continue to acquire existing self storage facilities  tax reassessments will continue to occur 
snow removal was the main factor behind the increase in repairs and maintenance and is largely uncontrollable 
national vendor programs have and will continue to be pursued which may drive down the cost of facility maintenance due to increased scale 
we are not forecasting any major increase in repairs and maintenance in we believe that through continued refinement of insurance and risk management processes that insurance costs can also be reduced 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately  available in cash and cash equivalents 
we will be required to distribute at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit 
we intend to use this cash to purchase additional self storage properties in the first quarter of therefore  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
on september   we  as guarantor  and our operating partnership entered into a million revolving line of credit credit facility  which includes a million swingline sub facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by self storage properties 
the operating partnership intends to use the proceeds of the credit facility for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
as of december   the credit facility had approximately million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility 
there was no principal balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december  on october   we entered into a reverse interest rate swap with us bank national association  relating to our existing  fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank  which is due pursuant to the swap agreement  we will receive fixed interest payments of and pay variable interest payments based on the one month libor plus 
on a notional amount of  there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million of debt  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 
as of december   the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt is 
the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december  is 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements  including operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures  dividends to stockholders  distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders  new facility development  property acquisitions  principal payments under our borrowings and non recurring capital expenditures 
we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings  joint ventures with third parties  and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt 
we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from self storage owners who desire tax deferral in their exiting transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december  total less than year years years after years operating leases      notes payable  notes payable to trusts and line of credit interest      principal      total contractual obligations    as of december   the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was  and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 
financing strategy we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors 
although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur  we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time  as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate 
in making financing decisions  our board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to the interest rate of the proposed financing  the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties  prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing  the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing  long term objectives with respect to the financing  target investment returns  the ability of particular properties  and the company as a whole  to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments  overall level of consolidated indebtedness  timing of debt and lease maturities  provisions that require recourse and cross collateralization  corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage  debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets  and the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt 
our indebtedness may be recourse  non recourse or cross collateralized 
if the indebtedness is non recourse  the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates 
in addition  we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties  or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 
we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness  to refinance investments  including the redevelopment of existing properties  for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 
seasonality the self storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september 
historically  our highest level of occupancy has been as of the end of july  while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 
results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
this statement supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 
as originally issued 
sfas r is effective for our year beginning january  we intend to use the modified prospective method to report stock compensation upon adoption of sfas r 
the stock based compensation expense for is not expected to be materially different than the pro forma expense disclosed for under apb no 
we will allocate the expense for unvested stock options granted prior to january  over the vesting period  unless the options are forfeited 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf creates a framework for evaluating whether a general partner or a group of general partners controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership 
eitf states that the presumption of general partner control would be overcome only when the limited partners have certain specific rights as outlined in eitf eitf is effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified 
for general partners in all other limited partnerships  eitf is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  currently  this guidance will not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or statement of cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our future income  cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we had million in total debt of which million is subject to variable interest rates including the million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap 
if libor were to increase or decrease by basis points  the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december  was  the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at december  was
