item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview opnet technologies  inc is a provider of management software for networks and applications 
our solutions address application performance management  network configuration management  capacity planning  and network research and development 
our customers include corporate enterprises  government and defense agencies  network service providers  and network equipment manufacturers 
our solutions are designed to help our customers make better use of resources  reduce operational problems and improve competitiveness 
we operate in one reportable industry segment  the development and sale of computer software programs and related services 
our operations are principally in the united states  and we have subsidiaries in australia  belgium  france  germany and the united kingdom 
we primarily depend upon our direct sales force to generate revenue in the united states 
sales outside the united states are made through our international sales team as well as third party distributors and value added resellers  who generally are responsible for providing technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our revenue is derived from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and training services 
new software license revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software  and excludes revenue derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and technical support revenue 
our software master license agreement provides our customers with the right to use our software either perpetually perpetual licenses or during a defined term  generally for two to four years term licenses 
for fiscal  perpetual licenses represented approximately of software license transactions 
substantially all of our software license arrangements include both perpetual licenses and software license updates and technical support 
software license updates and technical support revenue represent fees associated with the sale of unspecified license updates and technical support under our maintenance agreements 
we offer professional services  under both time and material and fixed price agreements  primarily to facilitate the adoption of our technology 
we consider our consulting services to be an integral part of our business model as they are centered on our software product offerings 
because our consulting services facilitate the adoption of our solutions  we believe that they ultimately generate additional sales of software licenses 
the key strategies of our business plan include increasing sales to existing customers  increasing deal size by selling modules and introducing new products  improving our sales and marketing execution  establishing alliances to extend our market reach and increasing our international presence 
we have focused our sales  marketing  and other efforts on corporate enterprise and united states government opportunities  and to a much lesser extent  service provider and network equipment manufacturer opportunities 
our focus and strategies are designed to increase revenue and profitability 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of revenue growth  we expect to need to closely manage the increases in our total expenses as we implement these strategies 
in march  we entered into a multi year worldwide distribution agreement with cisco systems 
under the terms of the agreement  cisco is distributing a broad range of our software products 
we will also collaborate 
table of contents with cisco s network management technology group to develop new network management solutions 
cisco began sales of our products in the second half of calendar  and we started recording revenue from the cisco systems agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal in november  we entered into a global sales and marketing agreement with computer associates 
under the terms of the agreement  computer associates began marketing our systems performance and capacity modeling technologies 
computer associates began sales of our products in the third quarter of fiscal  and we started recording revenue from the computer associates agreement during the third quarter of fiscal summary of our fiscal financial performance during fiscal  we increased revenue  gross profit  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and deferred revenue 
we believe that revenue growth during fiscal was attributable to executing on our business plan and to an improving economy 
the following table summarizes information on certain key metrics 
fiscal fiscal amount change percentage change dollars in thousands  except per share data operations data total revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross margin total operating expenses income loss from operations income from operations as a percentage of total revenue operating margin net income diluted net income per common share total employees period end total average employees total consultants period end total quota carrying sales persons period end financial condition and liquidity data cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities period end cash flows from operating activities total deferred revenue period end we achieved growth in all revenue categories during fiscal the growth in total revenue was generated primarily by growth in sales of our products and services to corporate enterprises  and to a lesser extent  sales of our products and services to service providers and the united states government 
while total revenue generated from sales of products and services to the united states government increased in absolute dollars by  during fiscal  the percentage of revenue from transactions with the united states government decreased to of total revenue for fiscal from of total revenue for fiscal united states government customers  including the department of defense  utilize our software and professional services to take advantage of our extensive expertise and intellectual property in networking  applications  and protocols 
our ability to model and simulate end to end network and application performance is valuable in determining the impact of tactical or strategic changes to networks  planning for contingencies  and evaluating the impact of new network technologies and protocols 
in addition  our solutions are scalable and address large  complex military systems 
table of contents and networks ie  mobile networks with a variety of operationally proven  advanced predictive performance techniques 
this enables the department of defense to use our software and services to achieve important transformational objectives such as network centricity and improved battle space awareness 
our international revenue increased to  million  or of total revenue  for fiscal we expect revenue from sales outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
international revenue in fiscal benefited from a more experienced direct sales force and our increased focus on corporate enterprises 
sales to corporate enterprises accounted for the largest portion of our international revenue during fiscal during fiscal  sales to corporate enterprises and service providers accounted for the majority of our international revenue 
we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
during fiscal  gross profit increased to  although our gross profit increased in absolute dollars in fiscal  it declined as a percentage of total revenue  decreasing from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline as a percentage of total revenue was expected and was attributable to our implementation of strategies designed to expand our consulting business  which yields a lower gross margin than revenue from new software licenses and software license updates and technical support 
as a software company  we believe that our business model has the potential to generate operating margins of or more 
our operating margin decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the decrease in operating margin during fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely the result of increased legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the increase in legal expenses was partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
during fiscal  we do not expect expenses associated with the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation to have a significant impact on operating margins  since the company signed a confidential settlement agreement with compuware corporation on april  trends that may affect our business and future results while we are cautiously optimistic that economic conditions will continue to improve and result in a stronger environment for it spending  an economic downturn or adverse change in the regulatory environment or business prospects for our customers may decrease our revenue or lower our growth rate 
the demand for our products and services by corporate enterprise and united states government customers has been much stronger than the demand from service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
we believe that lower business activity with service providers and network equipment manufacturers is primarily due to the challenging economy in which these businesses operate  which we expect to continue  at least in the near term 
consequently  our revenue growth and financial results depend  in significant part  upon the economic health of corporate enterprises and united states government agencies and the general environment for it spending 
we intend to take advantage of a gradually improving economy and expect to increase spending in all areas of our business in order to promote future growth 
we anticipate the following trends and patterns over the next several quarters total revenue 
despite indications that the overall economy and it industry are improving  we continue to see cautious capital spending by our current and potential customers 
we currently expect any future growth in revenue to come from sales to enterprise it organizations and the united states government 
we expect revenue from sales to service providers and network equipments manufacturers to fluctuate from quarter to quarter with the potential for periods of declining license revenue 
our ability to increase professional service revenue will depend upon our ability to maintain several large consulting contracts with the united states government and to attract and retain additional qualified consultants  including those with security clearances 
as a result of these factors  we believe that we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue 

table of contents international revenue 
our international sales are impacted by the mix of direct and indirect sales channels and our focus on increasing sales to corporate enterprises 
we believe that these factors impact the timing of sales orders as well as our ability to forecast future revenue 
we expect overall international revenue growth in fiscal  however  we expect to continue experiencing quarterly fluctuations of international revenue 
gross profit margin 
we anticipate an increase in the cost of professional services primarily from hiring additional consultants to support demand for our services 
our overall gross profit margin will be affected by the profitability of individual consulting engagements as well as the amount of gross profit from the sale of new software licenses and software license updates and technical support  which have substantially higher gross margins than the gross margin on professional service revenue 
research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development will be required to maintain our competitive position and broaden our product lines  as well as enhance the features and functionality of our current products 
we made significant personnel investments in research and development during fiscal we expect that the absolute dollar amount of these expenditures will continue to grow but could generally decrease as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will depend upon increases in our revenue growth  among other factors 
sales and marketing expenses 
we depend upon our direct sales model to generate revenue and believe that increasing the size of our quota carrying sales team is essential for long term growth 
we plan to add quota carrying sales persons during fiscal to pursue our growth strategies 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses may increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the increase in legal expenses was partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
during fiscal  we do not expect legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation to have a significant impact on general and administrative expenses  since the company signed a confidential settlement agreement with compuware corporation on april  operating margin 
since a significant portion of our software license arrangements close in the latter part of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in the short term to respond to lower than expected revenue  which would adversely impact our operating margin and earnings 
our operating margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due primarily to a significant increase in our legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the increase in legal expenses was partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
during fiscal  we do not expect legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation to have a significant impact on operating margins  since the company signed a confidential settlement agreement with compuware corporation on april  we remain committed to our long term growth strategies and do not believe that adjustments to our cost structure are necessary at this time  but we intend to closely manage expenses 
acquisitions on october   we completed the acquisition of altaworks for a total purchase price of approximately  as a result of the merger  we acquired all the assets and liabilities of altaworks 
we paid the purchase price in cash from working capital 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired two commercially available software products that provide advanced correlation and analysis technologies to our product portfolio for end to end application performance analysis and  with the addition of altaworks employees  have greater engineering depth and technical expertise 

table of contents this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  consequently  operations of the acquired business were included in our financial statements prospectively from the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  software development costs and income taxes 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and training services 
we recognize revenue based on the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
new software license revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software  and excludes revenue derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and technical support revenue 
our new software license revenue consists of perpetual and term license sales of software products 
new software license revenue is recognized when these criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  the software license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for license arrangements with end users  it is our customary practice to have a written contract software license agreement  which is signed by both the end user and us  and a purchase order or equivalent 
a written contract can be executed based on the customer specific format or on the standard shrink wrap software master license agreement 
for those end users who have previously negotiated a software license agreement with us  the initial software license agreement is used as evidence of a written contract 
sales to distributors  resellers  and value added resellers collectively referred to as resellers are primarily made outside of north america and are evidenced by a master reseller agreement governing the relationship  which is signed by both the reseller and us  together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
to further evidence an arrangement  our master reseller agreement requires that the reseller provide to us copies of the end user s purchase order and executed copies of the end user s software master license agreements 
delivery has occurred 
physical delivery of our software products to end users or resellers collectively referred to as customers is generally considered to have occurred upon the transfer of media 
table of contents containing our software products to a common carrier usually fob shipping point based on standard agreement terms 
software products may also be delivered electronically to end users 
electronic delivery is deemed to occur after end users have been provided with access codes that allow them to take immediate possession of the software 
if a software arrangement includes undelivered software products or services that are essential to the functionality of delivered software products  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these software products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to any adjustments or refund of any portion of their license fees paid  acceptance provisions  cancellation privileges  or rights of return 
our normal payment terms for our software products and services currently range from net days to net days and primarily vary based on the country in which an agreement is executed 
payments that extend beyond our normal payment terms from the contract date but that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenue from such arrangements is recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
in instances when any of the four criteria are not met  we defer recognition of software license revenue until the criteria are met 
when the sale of the software product requires us to make significant enhancements  customization or modifications to the software that are essential to its functionality  software license revenue and consulting fees are recognized using contract accounting under sop we estimate the percentage of completion  under sop  based on our estimate of total hours to complete the project as a percentage of total hours incurred and the estimated hours to complete 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software license revenue and professional services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements  and continuity and attrition level of professional services staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if we are required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if we expect to incur a loss on the project 
software license updates and technical support revenue represents fees associated with the sale of periodic unspecified product updates license updates and technical support under our maintenance agreements 
license updates consist of the right to unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis and are entered into in connection with the initial software license purchase 
license updates and technical support may be renewed upon expiration of the term 
customers can purchase license updates separately from technical support 
revenue from license updates and technical support is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which typically include new software licenses  consulting services  training and maintenance agreements sold together  are allocated to each element in the arrangement primarily using the residual method based upon the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
discounts  if any  are applied to the delivered elements  usually software licenses  under the residual method 
for periodic unspecified product 
table of contents updates and technical support agreements  vsoe is based upon either the renewal rate specified in each contract or the price charged when sold separately 
for consulting services and training  vsoe is based upon the rates charged for these services when sold separately 
if the only undelivered elements in an arrangement are periodic unspecified updates or technical support agreements for which we are unable to establish vsoe  all revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and training and is recognized as the services are performed 
when we enter into consulting service arrangements that include significant modifications to the software that are essential to the customer s use and the arrangement is bundled with software  revenue under the entire arrangement is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
in these circumstances  revenue to be recognized after applying the residual method is allocated to new software license revenue based upon the relative list price of each product  and to professional service revenue based upon the vsoe of fair value of the professional services  respectively 
we sell new software licenses  license updates and technical support agreements to distributors at predetermined prices 
sales to distributors are not contingent upon resale of the software to the end user 
in most cases  we provide license updates and technical support agreements directly to distributors and the distributors provide support to the end customer 
revenue from sales to distributors is recorded at the amounts charged and in the same manner as all other new software license  license updates and technical support sales 
amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for the limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires significant estimates 
in estimating the allowance  we consider the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  should any of these factors change  our estimates will also change  which could affect the amount of our future allowance for doubtful accounts as well as future operating income 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances could be required 
as of march   accounts receivable totaled  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of acquired technology related to our acquisitions of netmaker in march  wdm netdesign in january  a software product for modeling voice communications in december  altaworks in october  and purchased technology related to the webload ft technology we purchased from radview software  ltd 
in december they are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of five years except for intangible assets acquired from the altaworks acquisition and software purchased from radview software  ltd  which are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
we use the projected discounted cash flow method in valuing our acquired technology related to acquisitions  using certain assumptions including revenue growth  cost levels  present value discount rate  and working capital requirements 
we use the amount of cash paid to value purchased technology 
while we believe the assumptions used to value our acquired technology related to acquisitions are reasonable  actual results will likely differ from those assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
we will periodically review the value of acquired technology for reasonableness 
changes in our assumptions at the time of future periodic reviews could result in impairment losses 
as of march   intangible assets totaled  net of accumulated amortization of  no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform an annual review during our fourth quarter or 
table of contents earlier to identify any facts or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
the review is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections and the market capitalization of our common stock 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value 
as of march   we had goodwill of  no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
accounting for software development costs 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to our customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage 
to date  products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time and all research and development costs have been expensed 
consequently  no research and development costs were capitalized in fiscal  and income taxes 
the income tax provision includes income taxes currently payable plus the net change during the year in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the differences between the carrying value under gaap and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated fiscal fiscal fiscal revenue new software licenses software license updates and technical support professional services total revenue cost of revenue new software licenses software license updates and technical support professional services amortization of acquired technology total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents the following table sets forth  for each component of revenue  the cost of the revenue as a percentage of the related revenue for the periods indicated fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of new software license revenue cost of software license updates and technical support cost of professional service revenue revenue new software license revenue 
new software license revenue was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal for fiscal  the increase in license revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes to service providers and corporate enterprises of the platform products vne server  it sentinel  sp sentinel  netcop  and panorama and modules such as ace advanced console  commander console and planning and design  netcop  ace advanced planning module  specialized model  commander  sitlm and planning and design modules became available in fiscal royalties pertaining to a distribution agreement with cisco systems also contributed to the increase in fiscal license revenue as compared to fiscal the increase in license revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher sales volumes to corporate enterprises and united states government customers of the platform products opnet it guru  opnet sp guru  it sentinel  sp sentinel and dnvm and modules such as flow analysis  netdoctor  and wireless 
it sentinel  sp sentinel and dnvm became available in fiscal software license updates and technical support revenue 
software license updates and technical support revenue was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal software license updates and technical support revenue growth rates are affected by the overall new software license revenue growth rates  as well as the renewal rate of annual maintenance contracts by existing customers 
the increase in software license updates and technical support revenue in fiscal and fiscal reflects increases in the overall customer installed base as compared to the prior year 
professional service revenue 
the components of professional services for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands consulting services training and other income professional services revenue professional service revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and of in fiscal from fiscal consulting services revenue comprises   and of professional service revenue for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in professional service revenue were primarily due to growing demand for our consulting services by united states government agencies 
revenue from consulting services provided to united states government agencies were   and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal in january  we were awarded a consulting contract with the united states department of defense that contributed approximately  and  of consulting revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the funding under this contract for calendar year was  under the first of four possible contract extensions  the funding under this contract for was  
table of contents in january  we were awarded the contract option for calendar year in the amount of  the option contributed approximately  and of consulting revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
funding under this award may be increased or decreased during the calendar year 
in february  we were awarded the contract option for calendar year in the amount of  the option contributed approximately of consulting revenue for fiscal the option year for calendar year under this contract may be exercised by the united states department of defense at its discretion 
our future results of operations could be adversely affected if any of the remaining options are not exercised or the contract otherwise does not receive additional funding 
funding under this award may be increased or decreased during the calendar year 
international revenue 
our international revenue increased to  or of total revenue and from  or of total revenue  for fiscal and  respectively 
our international revenue increased during fiscal from  or of total revenue  for fiscal our international revenue is primarily generated in europe and japan 
we have focused our efforts on increasing international sales to corporate enterprises 
international revenue from corporate enterprises comprised the largest percentage of international revenue for fiscal during fiscal   and  we expanded our operations outside the united states through the hiring of additional direct sales persons in our foreign subsidiaries 
cost of revenue cost of new software license revenue consists primarily of royalties  media  manuals  and distribution costs 
cost of license updates and technical support revenue consists of royalties  media  distribution costs  and personnel related costs in providing technical support 
cost of professional service revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing consulting and training to our customers 
gross margins on new software license revenue and software license updates and technical support revenue are substantially higher than gross margin on professional service revenue  due to the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing professional services 
cost of new software license revenue 
cost of software license revenue was   and in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on software licenses revenue was   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the cost of new software license revenue is primarily comprised of royalty payments required for certain of our software license sales 
consequently  the proportion of licenses sold that require royalty payments impacts the gross margin 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of proportionately fewer license sales requiring royalty payments 
cost of software license updates and technical support revenue 
cost of software license updates and technical support revenue was   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on software license updates and technical support revenue was   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the cost of software license updates and technical support revenue is primarily impacted by the cost of labor associated with providing technical support  and to a lesser extent  royalty payments required for certain license update sales 
gross margins increased in fiscal from fiscal due to a decrease in the proportion of license updates sold that require royalty payments 
gross margins decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to higher royalty payments related to sales of software updates and increases in headcount necessary to support our increasing customer base 
cost of professional service revenue 
cost of professional service revenue was   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin on professional service revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margin on professional service revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in cost of professional services and the resulting lower gross margins for fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to an increase in our consulting staff to meet demand for our services and the costs necessary to recruit  train and assign new 
table of contents consulting staff to billable projects 
we expect the cost of professional services revenue as a percentage of professional services revenue to vary based primarily on the costs necessary to recruit and train new consulting staff and the profitability of individual consulting engagements 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of increased staffing levels required for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of the altaworks acquisition and increased staffing levels required for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased commission expense related to increased sales and increases in our sales and marketing staff to pursue our business plan 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of increased staffing levels  and to a lesser extent  increased commissions and travel costs associated with pursuing our business plan 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to incurring  in legal expenses related to the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation in september of  which was partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the lawsuit filed by compuware corporation 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increase professional services costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased staffing levels necessary to pursue our business plan 
other income expense 
other income  net was   and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increases in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income is primarily the result of an increase in the aggregate balance of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities together with an increase in interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were   and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of adjusting projected foreign tax credits and projected research and development tax credits to the actual amount of the credits computed in conjunction with completing and filing our fiscal tax return 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to recording a tax adjustment of related to an irs examination of research and development tax credits claimed on our corporate tax returns for fiscal and see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the irs examination 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from period to period due principally to the amount of income before taxes from various tax jurisdictions  foreign tax expense  and the amount of tax credits available to us in each period from incremental research expenditures 
future provisions for taxes will depend  among other things  on the mix and amount of worldwide income  the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions and the company s eligible amount of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits and other items 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and through the sale of equity securities 
in august  we completed our initial public offering in which we raised approximately  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling  cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net income  as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense  tax benefits from exercise of employee stock options  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the collections of accounts receivable 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to lower net income due to increased general and administrative expenses related to professional services costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased staffing levels necessary to pursue our business plan 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for fiscal net cash used in investing activities was  and  for fiscal and  respectively

in october  the board approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options that had an exercise price of or greater and are held by current employees  including executive officers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risks and believe that the risk is minimal 
our outstanding note payable has a fixed interest rate and its carrying value approximates fair value 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or notes payable 
at march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and  in marketable securities 
based on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of march   a basis point increase decrease in the interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately  a majority of our revenue transactions outside the united states are denominated in united states dollars 
the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
we currently do not hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
due to the limited nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a change in exchange rates would have a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations
