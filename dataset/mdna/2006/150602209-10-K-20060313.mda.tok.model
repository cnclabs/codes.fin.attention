item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate company  and focuses primarily on the ownership  operation  development and redevelopment of supermarket anchored community shopping centers and drug store anchored convenience centers located in nine states  largely in the northeast and mid atlantic regions 
at december   the company had a portfolio of properties totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla  including wholly owned properties comprising approximately million square feet and six properties owned through joint ventures comprising approximately  square feet 
at december   the portfolio was comprised of i stabilized properties those properties not designated as development redevelopment properties and which are at least leased  with an aggregate of million square feet of gla  which were approximately leased  ii seven development redevelopment properties with an aggregate of million square feet of gla  which were approximately leased  and iii three non stabilized properties with an aggregate of  square feet of gla  which are presently being re tenanted and which were approximately leased as of december  overall  the portfolio was approximately leased at december  the company  organized as a maryland corporation  has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially all of its assets to the operating partnership  organized as a limited partnership under the laws of delaware 
at december   the company owned approximately of the operating partnership and is its sole general partner  the company conducts substantially all of its business through the operating partnership 
op units are economically equivalent to the company s common stock and are convertible into the company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one to one basis 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long term leases 
the company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the terms of their leases 
the company focuses its investment activities on supermarket anchored community shopping centers and drug store anchored convenience centers 
the company believes  because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at such centers  that the nature of its investments provide for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times 
the company continues to seek opportunities to acquire stabilized properties and properties suited for development and or redevelopment activities where it can utilize its experience in shopping center construction  renovation  expansion  re leasing and re merchandising to achieve long term cash flow growth and favorable investment returns 
the company would also consider investment opportunities in regions beyond its present markets in the event such opportunities were consistent with its focus  could be effectively controlled and managed by it  have the potential for favorable investment returns  and contribute to increased shareholder value 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments and purchase price allocations related thereto  asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
these accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management s estimates are based on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 

back to contents the company has identified the following critical accounting policies  the application of which requires significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the respective terms of the leases 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over base rents under applicable lease provisions is included in rents and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 
leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred 
in addition  certain operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
the company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
the company must make estimates as to the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rent  straight line rent  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in tenants payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the provision for depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred 
expenditures for betterments that substantially extend the useful lives of the properties are capitalized 
the company is required to make subjective estimates as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
a shorter estimate of the useful life of an investment would have the effect of increasing depreciation expense and lowering net income  whereas a longer estimate of the useful life of the investment would have the effect of reducing depreciation expense and increasing net income

 goodwill and other intangibles  in valuing real estate acquisitions 
in connection therewith  the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to land  buildings and improvements 
in addition  the fair value of in place leases is allocated to intangible lease assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  which value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
in valuing an acquired property s intangibles  factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related costs 
the value of in place leases is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates  over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates  measured over the non cancelable terms 
this aggregate value is allocated among above market and below market leases  and other intangibles based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease 
the value of other intangibles is amortized to expense  and the above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be immediately recognized in operations 
management is required to make subjective assessments in connection with its valuation of real estate acquisitions 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because above market and below market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income  and the value of other intangibles is amortized to expense 
the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to recognize and measure impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment event exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair market value 
real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period held for sale 
management is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because an impairment loss is recognized in the period that the assessment is made 
hedging activities from time to time  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
derivative instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
any change in the value of a derivative is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  whereas the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in operations 
if interest rate assumptions and other factors used to estimate a derivative s fair value or methodologies used to determine a derivative s effectiveness were different  amounts included in the determination of net income or accumulated other comprehensive income loss could be affected 
results of operations acquisitions 
differences in results of operations between and  and between and  respectively  were driven largely by acquisitions

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely recognized measure of reit performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income applicable to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are computed to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in computing ffo  the company does not add back to net income applicable to common shareholders the amortization of costs incurred in connection with its financing or hedging activities  or depreciation of non real estate assets  but does add back to net income applicable to common shareholders those items that are defined as extraordinary under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income applicable to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
as the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo  the computation of ffo may vary from one company to another 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs 
the following table sets forth the company s calculations of ffo for the years ended december   and 
back to contents net income loss applicable to common shareholders  add deduct depreciation and amortization   limited partners interest    minority interests    minority interests share of ffo   funds from used in operations    ffo per common share assuming conversion of op units weighted average number of common shares shares used in determination of earnings per share  additional shares assuming conversion of op units   shares used in determination of ffo per share   inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation has had the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
however  the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its mortgage loans payable and secured revolving credit facility 
the company will  when advantageous  hedge its interest rate risk using derivative financial instruments 
the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily through i the secured floating rate revolving credit facility used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand its real estate investment portfolio  and ii floating rate acquisition and construction financing 
the company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows  and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company may borrow at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and or treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related variable rate financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is managed using a variety of techniques 
at december   long term debt consisted of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans payable  and the variable rate secured revolving credit facility 
the average interest rate on the million of fixed rate indebtedness outstanding was  with maturities at various dates through the average interest rate on the company s million of variable rate debt was  with maturities at various dates through at december   the company s pro rata share of variable rate debt amounted to million 
based upon this amount  if interest rates either increase or decrease by  the company s net income would decrease or increase respectively by approximately  per annum
