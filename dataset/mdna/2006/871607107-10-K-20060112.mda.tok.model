item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item and by the risk factors set forth below under the caption entitled factors that may affect future results 
please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part of this annual report on form k regarding forward looking statements 
synopsys business synopsys  inc synopsys is a world leader in electronic design automation eda software and related services for semiconductor design 
we deliver technology leading semiconductor design and verification software platforms and integrated circuit ic manufacturing software products to the global electronics market  enabling the development and production of complex systems on chips socs 
in addition  we provide intellectual property ip and design services to simplify the design process  and accelerate time to market for our customers 
we also provide software and services that help customers prepare their designs for manufacturing 
business environment we generate substantially all of our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development r d budgets 
as a result  our customers business outlook and willingness to invest in new  and increasingly complex  chip designs heavily influence our business 
beginning in late calendar  the semiconductor industry experienced its steepest and longest downturn of the past years 
semiconductor industry sales dropped approximately from late to early and then recovered slowly into throughout this period  our customers took many steps to reduce their expenses  including constraining r d and eda expenditures  reducing the number of design engineers they employed  cutting back on their design starts  purchasing from fewer suppliers and requiring more favorable pricing  payment and license terms from those suppliers  as well as pursuing consolidation within their own industry 
further  during this downturn  many semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined 
historically  growth in semiconductor sales has been followed by growth in semiconductor r d spending  which in turn has led to subsequent growth in eda expenditures 
however  although the semiconductor industry association sia reported semiconductor industry growth of approximately in and in  and we believe r d spending among large semiconductor companies increased approximately from to  eda spending in and did not  in fact  track this upturn 
we believe this occurred for a number of reasons 
first  in light of the severity of the downturn  we believe customers intense focus on expense reduction continued even after the downturn ended  and that  as a result  they now generally approach spending more conservatively 
second  the consumer electronics market  in which product price is a primary competitive factor  has been a key driver of the semiconductor industry s recovery 
this price pressure has placed pressure on product development costs and r d spending 
third  increased globalization has placed significant pressure on end user product prices and  as a result  product development costs 
finally  we believe our customers became more cautious about their own business outlook in mid calendar due to a number of factors  including lack of visibility into their own future results  unexpected inventory buildup in the semiconductor supply chain and concerns about the industry s growth prospects in these factors have caused our customers to continue to seek to control costs  including by limiting their eda spending 
following the third quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated the factors discussed above and the reduced customer demand for upfront licenses  which have shorter payment terms than time based licenses and which had accounted for approximately of our license orders from august through the third quarter of fiscal this reduced demand for upfront licenses materially and adversely affected both our bookings revenue and operating cash flow for the third quarter and full year fiscal recognizing our customers increased preference for conserving cash by paying for their licenses over time rather than upfront  effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of time based licenses  in which customers typically pay the license fee ratably over the term of the license 
as a result  upfront licenses represented approximately of our license orders in the five quarters since this shift 
we believe this model shift meets our customers needs  improves the predictability of our business and helps us preserve the value of our technology by reducing the need to book a given license or licenses at the end of a quarter to generate current quarter revenue 
however  this shift negatively impacted our revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations over the last five quarters and  as a result  revenue and earnings for the full year fiscal were below the levels in full year fiscal over the long term  eda spending growth will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r d spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market 
the sia has forecasted modest growth in semiconductor revenues in and we believe semiconductor r d spending will grow similarly during however  we cannot currently predict whether this outlook will contribute to higher r d spending and or to higher eda spending 
if eda spending increases  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on such increases 
further  recognizing that our customers will continue to spend cautiously and aggressively contain costs  we are intensely focused on improving our customers overall economics of design by providing more fully integrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their eda spending with us 
we are under no obligation and expressly disclaim any such obligation to update or alter any of the information contained in this overview  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except to the extent required by law 
fiscal product developments during fiscal  we announced or introduced a number of new products and product developments  including general availability of our ic compiler physical design solution  which unifies previously separate ic design operations by providing concurrent physical synthesis  clock tree synthesis  routing  yield optimization and sign off correlation and delivering significant improvements in design performance and productivity 
announcement of our primerail comprehensive solution for timing  signal integrity and power network sign off 
addition of vcs assertion ip library and native test bench support  helping engineers find more design bugs faster and achieve up to five times faster verification performance 
availability of new tcad tools from our acquisition of ise integrated systems engineering ag in november and our sentaurus tool suite which embeds a comprehensive set of core tcad products for multi dimensional process  device and system simulation into a powerful user interface 
availability of enhanced analog and mixed signal offerings through our acquisition of nassda corporation in may fiscal financial performance summary revenue was million  down from  million in fiscal  primarily reflecting our fourth quarter fiscal license model shift  which significantly reduced upfront license and related maintenance revenue in fiscal time based license revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily reflecting the continued phase in of our license model shift as time based orders booked in prior periods contribute revenue to current and future periods 
upfront license revenue declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting our model driven de emphasis on upfront license bookings 
we derived approximately of our software license revenue from upfront licenses and from time based licenses in fiscal  versus approximately and  respectively  in fiscal  reflecting our license model shift 
maintenance revenue declined by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the shift to a more ratable license model which reduces new maintenance orders since maintenance is included with the license fee in time based licenses and not reported separately  and  to a lesser extent  by non renewal of maintenance by certain existing perpetual license customers 
professional service and other revenue  at million  increased from million in fiscal due to the timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts and continued full utilization of our services capacity 
net loss was million compared to net income of million in fiscal  primarily due to decreased upfront license revenue resulting from our license model transition  increased research and development expenses caused by our fiscal acquisitions of ise integrated systems engineering ag ise and nassda corporation  and increased sales commissions driven by higher shipments and other business performance related compensation  partially offset by a million litigation settlement gain in connection with the nassda acquisition 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal increased slightly to million from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of collections on increased bookings  the absence of fiscal payments relating to the termination of the monolithic systems  inc acquisition  and reduced taxes paid as a result of the net loss for the year  partially offset by increased payments relating to our information technology infrastructure 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for approximately million 
fiscal acquisitions during fiscal  we acquired i ise  expanding our tcad software offerings  ii nassda corporation nassda  which broadens our offering of transistor level circuit simulation tools  particularly in the area of mixed signal and memory designs  and iii certain assets of leda design  a developer of mixed signal intellectual property ip  which will help synopsys meet increasing customer demand for ip solutions 
critical accounting policies we base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which we prepare in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
synopsys recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of synopsys software 
maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees 
synopsys has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
with respect to software licenses  synopsys utilizes three license types technology subscription licenses tsls are for a finite term  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
we bundle and do not charge separately for post contract customer support maintenance or pcs for the term of the license 
term licenses are also for a finite term  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance  plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the three software license types  we recognize revenue as follows technology subscription licenses 
synopsys typically recognizes revenue from tsl license fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period  or  if later  as customer installments become due and payable 
all tsls are reported as time based licenses 
term licenses 
synopsys recognizes the term license fee in full if  upon shipment of the software  payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
such term licenses are reported as upfront licenses 
for term licenses where less than of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment  synopsys recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
due and payable term licenses are reported as time based licenses 
perpetual licenses 
synopsys recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if  upon shipment of the software  payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
such perpetual licenses are reported as upfront licenses 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
such perpetual licenses are reported as time based licenses 
synopsys allocates revenue on software transactions referred to as arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to consulting 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term  and we recognize revenue from consulting services as the related services are performed and accepted 
synopsys makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii its fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement  our customary practice is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and synopsys or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes  or keys  that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and recognize revenue upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
in the case of a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable  due to the fact that maintenance services are included with the software license and due to guidelines relating to arrangements that include rights to receive unspecified future technology 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer or where an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 
if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon its credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue on a cash collected basis 
we recognize maintenance and service revenue as follows maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses 
synopsys recognizes revenue from maintenance associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term 
professional service fees 
synopsys recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services are performed and accepted 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer installed base relationships  trademarks and trade names  covenants not to compete  customer backlog  and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our intangible assets  net was million 
we operate in one operating segment 
we evaluate aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in addition  we evaluate goodwill for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we assess the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our goodwill was million 
income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover all or part of the deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if it is ultimately determined that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the liability would be reversed and the tax benefit would be recognized in the period in which it is determined that the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
see income tax rate  below  and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a notice of proposed adjustment from the internal revenue service irs we received in may asserting a very large net increase to our us taxable income arising from the audit of fiscal years and results of operations revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
under current accounting rules and policies applicable to different kinds of license arrangements  we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times 
in general  we recognize revenue on a time based software license order or tbl  over the license term  and on an upfront term or perpetual software license order at the time the license is shipped 
substantially all of our current time based licenses are technology subscription licenses  or tsls  with an average license term of approximately three years 
maintenance orders generally generate revenue ratably over the maintenance period generally  one year 
professional service orders generally generate revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones 
a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time based license  upfront license  maintenance and professional service revenue for such period 
we derive time based license revenue in any quarter almost entirely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront license orders booked and shipped during the quarter 
we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year 
we also derive professional service revenue almost entirely from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted  not when they are booked 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront license orders booked and shipped during the quarter 
our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of time based and upfront licenses delivered during the quarter 
a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods 
for example  a  order for a three year tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter  but  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
conversely  upfront licenses generate higher current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg  a  order for an upfront license generates  in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped  but no future revenue 
tsls also result in a shift of maintenance revenue to time based license revenue since maintenance is included in tsls  while maintenance on upfront orders is charged and reported separately 
license order mix the percentage of upfront licenses we book is driven by a number of factors  including the level of overall license orders  customer demand  preferred customer payment terms and customer requested ship dates 
prior to august  substantially all of our license revenue was upfront 
beginning in august  when we introduced tsls  we shifted our target license order mix to approximately tsls and upfront licenses  based on our expectations of total orders and our assessment of the demand for upfront licenses 
we substantially maintained this mix from this date through fiscal however  as a result of reduced customer demand for upfront licenses as described above in business environment  we shifted to an almost completely time based license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal our actual license order mix for the last nine fiscal quarters is set forth below 
q q q q q q q q q time based licenses upfront licenses in certain cases  our time based and upfront term license agreements provide the customer the right to re mix a portion of the software initially licensed for other synopsys specified products 
the customer s re mix of product  when allowed under the license arrangement  does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer 
because in such cases the customer does not need to obtain a new license and pay additional license fees to use the additional products  these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately 
however  we believe providing our customers re mix rights can also assist in broader adoption of our products 
total revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions the decrease in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to our license model shift begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which significantly reduced both upfront license fees and maintenance revenue in fiscal the decrease in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to i a lower level of orders than expected in fiscal  ii our shift in the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable license model and iii lower maintenance revenue 
time based license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in time based license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our fourth quarter fiscal license model shift under which previously booked orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods 
the increase in time based revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continued phase in of our initial august ratable license model shift and to the full year revenue contribution in fiscal from a strong level of time based license orders received during fiscal upfront license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the decrease in upfront license revenue  in both percentage and absolute dollar terms  for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that we shipped a substantially higher than average percentage of orders as upfront licenses in the second and third quarters of fiscal and subsequently shifted to a higher ratable license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in upfront revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the shift to a higher ratable license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to lower than expected upfront orders in dollar terms in the third quarter of fiscal when compared to fiscal unfilled upfront license orders were approximately million at october  compared to million as of october  unfilled upfront license orders represent non cancelable license orders we have received from our customers but have not shipped as of the end of the applicable fiscal period 
we generally ship our software products promptly after acceptance of customer orders 
however  a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and  as a result  timing of revenue recognition  including the delivery dates requested by customers  the effect of the related license revenue on our business plan  and our operational capacity to fulfill upfront software license orders at the end of a quarter 
maintenance and service revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions maintenance revenue professional service and other revenue total maintenance and service revenue percentage of total revenue our maintenance revenue has declined due to i our continued shift towards tsls  which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance revenue  ii generally lower maintenance rates on perpetual license transactions above million  and iii to a lesser extent  non renewal of maintenance by certain customers on perpetual or other upfront licenses 
with our license model shift  we  expect progressively more of our maintenance revenue to be included in tsl revenue  and therefore for our separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline 
in addition  some customers may choose in the future not to renew maintenance on upfront licenses for economic or other factors  which would also adversely affect future maintenance revenue 
professional service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and due to timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts 
events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses temporary shutdown of operations 
as a cost saving measure  we temporarily shut down operations in north america for three days during the first quarters of fiscal and  respectively  and four days during the third quarters of fiscal and  respectively  resulting in savings of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the savings in fiscal  and relate primarily to salaries and benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total savings workforce reduction 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  we reduced expenses by decreasing the number of employees in most departments in domestic and foreign locations 
this workforce reduction affected approximately employees in fiscal employees in the us and employees outside the us  and employees in fiscal employees in the us and employees outside the us  resulting in charges of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the charges in each fiscal year relate primarily to severance and other special termination benefits and are included in our consolidated financial statements as follows year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total charge workforce realignment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we realigned our operations to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient 
this realignment affected most departments and resulted in termination of employment of a total of employees in the united states and employees outside the united states 
charges for severance and other termination benefits totaling million were reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal as follows 
year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total charge certain option expenses 
subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we discovered an error in our option grant process related to the documentation of grant dates 
this error was solely with respect to grants to non executive officer employees 
the impact of this error on our first through third quarter income statement was approximately million 
we booked in the fourth quarter million as follows million in cost of goods sold  million in research and development expense  million in sales and marketing expense and million in general and administrative expense 
our results of operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year contained in our earnings release dated november  did not include this expense as we did not believe at that time the error would result in an adjustment to our operating results 
with the error corrected  we expect we will incur no additional expenses relating to this error 
functional allocation of operating expenses historically  we allocate certain human resource programs  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area 
annually  upon a significant change in headcount as in the case of a workforce reduction  realignment or acquisition  or as a result of other business related factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 
we conducted such a review following our workforce realignment in fiscal  the ise acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal and the nassda acquisition completed in the third quarter of fiscal the resulting expense allocations may contribute significantly to fluctuations in individual operating expenses from period to period 
cost of revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation total percentage of total revenue we divide cost of revenue into three categories i cost of license revenue  ii cost of maintenance and service revenue and iii amortization costs 
in april we revised our methodology for allocating and reporting cost of revenue externally to better align costs of revenue with the appropriate revenue categories 
we have reclassified cost of revenue for fiscal and to conform to this new allocation methodology 
in addition  we have segregated expenses directly associated with providing consulting and training from costs of revenue associated with internal functions which provide license delivery and post customer contract support services 
management then allocates these consulting and training costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on the proportion of license revenue and maintenance and service revenue reported during the quarter 
in general  our total cost of revenue is relatively fixed and does not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or license mix 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software products  both time based and upfront 
cost of license revenue includes the allocated cost of employee salary and benefits for providing software delivery  including software production costs  product packaging  amortization of capitalized software development costs related to synopsys products  documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors 
cost of maintenance and service revenue 
cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the related infrastructure necessary to manage a services and training organization 
further  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes allocated costs of employee salary and benefits for providing customer services  such as hot line and on site support  production employees and documentation of maintenance updates 
amortization costs 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts  core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed during fiscal  and we amortize intangible assets on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior and current year acquisitions 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation over the options remaining vesting period of one to four years 
generally  amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest  although employee terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i net reduction of million in amortization expense in core developed technology caused by completion of amortization from fiscal acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of avant corporation  and ii the reduction in royalty expense of million primarily resulting from an accrual of million recorded in fiscal for a potential payment that was determined not required to be paid 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of i million in compensation and employee benefits as a result of a our increased investment in professional services personnel and b higher variable compensation associated with our higher than expected business performance  ii million in compensation due to former ise employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones  and iii million in additional human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal see functional allocation of operating expenses  above 
total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during as compared to the revenue in fiscal and the fact that a large portion of our expenses are fixed 
the increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i an increase in amortization of million of core developed technology recorded as a result of our acquisitions completed in fiscal and  ii an increase of million in field support personnel costs due to targeted hiring in the customer support function  and iii million in additional human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal see functional allocation of operating expenses  above 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of i million in expenses relating to consulting services  ii million in employee expenses as discussed above under workforce realignment  and iii million higher royalty expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during and increased amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation from acquisitions in fiscal operating expenses research and development year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i an increase of million in research and development personnel and related costs primarily as a result of the ise and nassda acquisitions  including million in compensation due to former ise employees now employed by synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones  and ii an increase of million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal as a result of increased headcount 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in contractor costs as many former contractors in lower cost regions were converted to employees 
research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal remained relatively constant as a result of the following offsetting factors i a million reduction in depreciation expense allocated to this line item as a result of decreased capital spending and lower replacement costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  ii severance packages totaling million associated with our workforce reduction during fiscal which were not incurred during fiscal  iii a million decrease in consulting services in fiscal compared to fiscal  iv a million decrease in north america human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses in fiscal as a result of the decrease in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount  and v an increase of million in fiscal research and development personnel and related costs as a result of increased investment in research and development activities 
sales and marketing year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i an increase of million in variable compensation driven by increased shipments  higher commission rates applied to shipments beginning in fiscal and increased business performance related compensation  ii an increase of million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs due to increased headcount and acquisitions during the fiscal year  and iii an increase of million in severance related costs associated with a workforce reduction executed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal these increases were partially offset by decreases of i million as a result of a reduction in expenses for sales conferences and related meetings  ii million in human resources  information technology and facilities corporate allocated costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal as a result of decreased headcount  iii million related to reduced depreciation to this line item as a result of reduced headcount  and iv million related to reduced travel expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i a reduction of million in variable compensation  driven by reduced orders and shipments in fiscal  ii a reduction of million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of decreased headcount due to previous workforce reductions and realignments  and iii million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment 
this decrease was partially offset by increases of i million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount  and ii million related to expanded marketing efforts and charges associated with the cancellation of certain sales employee related functions 
general and administrative year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue fiscal general and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal primarily due to i the million merger termination fee paid to monolithic system technology  inc mosys in april in connection with termination of an acquisition agreement  ii million in professional service fees primarily related to litigation associated with the mosys termination incurred in  iii million in professional services fees incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of mosys expensed in the second quarter of fiscal  iv a decrease of million in bad debt reserve in fiscal due to lower than anticipated billings and successful collection efforts  v a decrease of million in facilities costs in fiscal due to closure of certain facilities  and vi a decrease of million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item in fiscal lower fiscal expenses were partially offset by an increase of i million in employee compensation in fiscal due to increased headcount  ii million in depreciation due to increased equipment and assets  and iii million in consulting costs primarily related to market and internal business process analyses

the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i the million termination fee paid to mosys and professional service fees of million relating to that transaction and the subsequent litigation in fiscal  ii an increase of million in professional service fees in fiscal relating to other litigation matters  iii million in facilities costs primarily related to planned facilities consolidation in fiscal  iv a loss of million related to the sublease of a portion of our ireland headquarters facility in fiscal  and v a million increase in depreciation due to increased capital spending in information technology 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item

in process research and development in process research and development iprd is comprised of in process technologies of i million associated with the acquisition of ise in fiscal  ii million associated with an acquisition in fiscal considered immaterial for financial statement purposes  iii million associated with our acquisition of numerical technologies  inc numerical described below  and iv million associated with an acquisition considered immaterial for financial statement purposes in fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 
valuation of iprd 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date 
the value of in process technology is then divided into two classifications i developed technology completed and ii in process technology to be completed  giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the acquisition 
these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors i time based data  ii cost based data and iii complexity based data 
the value of the in process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
under this approach  the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification divisions 
revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates  iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules  iv product sales cycles  and v the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
from the revenue estimates  operating expense estimates  including costs of sales  general and administrative  sales and marketing  income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets  were deducted to arrive at operating income 
we estimated revenue growth rates for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
operating expense estimates reflect synopsys historical expense ratios 
additionally  these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology is our weighted average cost of capital  taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at this time 
ise 
on november   we acquired ise  a world leading provider of tcad technology computer aided design software and related services 
the iprd expense related to the ise acquisition was million 
ise had one iprd project floops  a next generation process simulator 
we incurred a minimal amount in iprd related to this project which led to the introduction of our sentaurus product in the fourth quarter of fiscal this project is considered to be complete except for ongoing maintenance  future product enhancements and new features related to this core product 
expenditures to complete ise s acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
numerical 
on march   we acquired numerical  which specialized in subwavelength lithography enabling solutions 
the iprd expense related to the numerical acquisition was million 
numerical had five iprd projects phase shift masking psm  subwavelength software  equipment software  cadabra and computer aided transcription system cats representing    and  respectively  of the total iprd value 
these projects were expected to be completed shortly following the merger 
psm  subwavelength software and cats software were completed in fiscal our cadabra product was released in the first quarter of fiscal the equipment software project consists of in process technology for multiple products 
these products were either completed in fiscal  discontinued  or were integrated with other synopsys products during fiscal expenditures to complete numerical s acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts  core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete and other intangibles acquired in business combinations completed during fiscal  and we amortize intangible assets on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from three to ten years 
deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior year acquisitions 
we amortize deferred stock compensation on a straight line basis over the options remaining vesting period of one to four years 
generally  amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest  although employee terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization expense for these assets is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses total percentage of total revenue the decrease in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is driven by completion of the amortization of the intangible assets related to core developed technology from fiscal acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of avant  and by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions  partially offset by amortization charges from the ise and nassda acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to additional amortization of assets acquired in the numerical acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts 
impairment of intangible assets 
there were no material impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal  and expensing of stock awards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal sfas r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to its employees 
under this standard  we generally have not recognized any compensation expense related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or related to the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans 
under the new rules  we will be required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal years  and other income expense  net year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions interest income  net gain loss on sale of investments  net of investment write downs foreign currency exchange gain correction of an error in accounting for certain hedging transactions other total in the first quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas  resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions 
the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of our hedging program 
to correct the error  we reclassified the remaining million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended october  the increase in other income expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to i the million gain from the litigation settlement relating to the nassda acquisition  and ii the reclassification of million from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income 
this increase is primarily offset by million write down of certain investments 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in other income expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced investment gains and reduced rental income 
income tax rate income taxes 
the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of october   current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
non current deferred tax assets  net of non current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance  and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would charge to income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the us as of october   there was no cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 
irs revenue agent s report 
on may   we received a notice of proposed adjustment from the internal revenue service irs asserting a very large net increase to our us taxable income arising from the audit of fiscal years and on june   we received a revenue agent s report rar in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years and of approximately million  plus interest 
interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid  and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate  which adjusts quarterly 
a higher underpayment rate of interest may be charged as a result of the issuance of the rar 
this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
the proposed adjustment for fiscal years and is the total amount relating to these transactions asserted under the irs theories 
on july   we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs  which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs 
resolution of this matter could take a considerable time  possibly years 
we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws  and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals 
accordingly  we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously 
while we believe the irs asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law  we believe it is probable that we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter 
however  based on our analysis to date  we believe we have adequately provided for this matter 
if we are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
repatriation of foreign earnings 
the american jobs creation act of the act provides for a special one time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to of the eligible distribution 
during the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million  of which million qualified for the special one time elective dividends received deduction and million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the act  previously taxed income and return of capital 
we recorded tax expense of million related to the repatriation of million 
during the fourth quarter of  our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan drip to invest up to million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the act 
as required by the act  the reinvestment plan was ratified by the board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal we satisfied the drip reinvestment requirements during fiscal tax reserves 
we may establish reserves for tax contingencies based on the probable outcome of tax positions taken for financial statement purposes compared to positions taken on the tax returns 
in fiscal  we released tax contingency reserves totaling million related to previously acquired companies as a result of expiration of the applicable statute of limitation 
these released liabilities were recorded against acquisition goodwill with no effect on our net loss in fiscal we continuously review our tax contingency reserves to ensure that they are appropriately stated 
such review includes consideration of tax controversy factors such as periods covered by the cause of action  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  our ability to estimate the liability  the timing of the liability and how it will impact our other tax attributes 
at october   we believe that we have adequately provided for our tax related liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 
as of october   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million as of october  cash provided by operations is in part dependent upon the payment terms on our license agreements 
payment terms for time based licenses are generally extended  with the license fee typically paid quarterly in even increments over the term of the license 
conversely  for an upfront license  customers pay a substantial portion of the license fee within the first year 
accordingly  we generally receive cash from time based licenses  the primary component of our business under our almost fully ratable license model  later than from upfront licenses 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in fiscal this increase largely resulted from i an increase in deferred revenue of million due to the change in our licenses from upfront to time based licenses during the last quarter of fiscal  ii the payment of million for the mosys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation made in fiscal but not in  and iii lower disbursements for income taxes and value added taxes paid of approximately million and million  respectively 
this increase was offset by i increased disbursements of million associated with prepaid maintenance contracts for our information technology infrastructure as compared to the prior fiscal year  and ii million reduction in cash used to satisfy accounts payable in fiscal accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased million  or  to million as of october  from million as of october  days sales outstanding dso  calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  decreased to days as of october  from days as of october  the decrease in dso and accounts receivable is attributable to lower billings for the fiscal year due to greater concentration of tsls in our more ratable license model since cash is collected over a longer period of time for tsls than upfront licenses 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash from operations was driven in part by lower orders and reported revenues in fiscal  as well as by increased use of operating cash as follows i cash disbursements for foreign income taxes of approximately million  ii payment of million for the mosys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation costs  iii disbursements associated with our fiscal workforce realignment of approximately million  iv payments of international value added taxes of approximately million  and v increased prepaid maintenance contract expenses for our design and information systems electronic infrastructure 
these uses of cash were partially offset by income tax refunds of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased million  or  to million as of october  from million as of october  days sales outstanding dso  calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  decreased to days as of october  from days as of october  the decrease in accounts receivable and dso was attributable to a million reduction in new billings caused by lower orders during fiscal and longer customer payment terms compared to fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in collections compared to the prior fiscal year 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in fiscal cash used in investing activities remained relatively constant as we offset the increase of million of cash used in acquisitions by a corresponding reduction in cash used in net purchases of short term and long term investments 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to a substantial decrease of cash used for acquisitions and decreased proceeds from the sale of long term investments 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended october  compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal the decrease of million in cash used was due to a decrease of million in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market compared to the year ended october  and decreased proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans compared to fiscal cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds of million from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans during fiscal and increased purchases of our common stock in the open market of million during fiscal the american jobs creation act of the act provides for a special one time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to of the eligible distribution 
during the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million  of which million qualified for the special one time elective dividends received deduction and million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the act  previously taxed income and return of capital 
we recorded tax expense of million related to the repatriation of million 
during the fourth quarter of  our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan drip to invest up to million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the act 
as required by the act  the reinvestment plan was ratified by the board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal we satisfied the drip reinvestment requirements during fiscal we hold our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and in foreign accounts  primarily in ireland  bermuda  and japan 
as of october   we held an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and an aggregate of million in foreign accounts 
funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america 
with the exception of japan and the repatriated funds described above  we currently maintain a policy under apb  accounting for income taxes special areas  of permanently reinvesting such funds outside of the united states 
in april  we entered into a three year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
this facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash  as well as other non financial covenants 
the facility terminates on april  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  however  we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between and based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between and per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in april   we borrowed and repaid million under the credit facility 
on may   we borrowed million under this credit facility in connection with the acquisition of nassda 
we repaid this amount in full as of may  as of october   we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter in thousands long term debt lease obligations capital lease operating lease purchase obligations total commitments other long term liabilities on balance sheet total this commitment relates to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility

purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
includes a approximately million in promissory notes payable in september issued in connection with an acquisition in september and b a bond payable in september to the city of san jose for participating in a development project for land owned by us 
additional information is provided in note of our consolidated financial statements 
certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet  such as unearned revenue  are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future 
we are committed to making an additional payment of million related to the bond payable in note above 
in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to october   we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the next months and an additional million in cash during the two years following the next months if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved in full 
because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals being achieved in full  these amounts are not reflected in the table above 
we closed our acquisition of hpl technologies  inc hpl on december  and are committed to make cash expenditures in fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts are not reflected in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly
