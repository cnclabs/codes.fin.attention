overview business description we are a leading temporary healthcare staffing company and the largest provider of per diem nurse staffing services in the united states as measured by revenues 
more than two thirds of our clients are acute care hospitals  clinics and surgical and ambulatory care centers 
we serve both for profit and not for profit organizations that range in scope from one facility to national chains with over facilities 
our clients pay us directly 
we do not receive a material portion of our revenues from medicare or medicaid reimbursements or similar state reimbursement programs 
our per diem nurse staffing division currently operates in an integrated network of branches that are organized into several geographic regions 
these branches serve as our direct contact with our healthcare professionals and clients 
the cost structure of a typical branch is substantially fixed  consisting of limited personnel  office space rent  information systems infrastructure and office supplies 
we have been able to develop a highly efficient branch management model that is easily scalable 
during  we expanded our services to provide temporary general staffing 
our per diem general staffing assignments place individuals in a variety of areas including clerical  janitorial and food services 
we believe that general staffing compliments our temporary healthcare staffing and makes us a full service provider to our existing clients 
industry trends service revenues and gross profit margins have been under pressure as demand for temporary nurses has been going through a period of contraction 
however  the rate of contraction has slowed during the past year 
due to the current difficult economic times  the unemployment rate  while slightly improved over the past year  remains relatively high 
we believe this has resulted in nurses in many households becoming a primary wage earner  which is causing such nurses to seek more traditional full time employment 
additionally  hospitals are experiencing lower than projected admissions levels and are placing greater reliance on existing full time staff  resulting in increased overtime and nurse patient loads 
we cannot predict when conditions will reverse  but we are confident in the long term growth of the industry 
in a january  report  the us census bureau  population projections bureau  projected that the number of americans over years of age is expected to grow from million in to million in in a july report  the us department of health and human services stated that the national supply of full time equivalent registered nurses was approximately million while demand was approximately million 
this gap between supply and demand for nurses is expected to grow from million in to million by additionally  there is a growing trend to restrict mandatory healthcare worker overtime requirements by employers and to establish nurse patient ratios 
several states have enacted legislation prohibiting mandatory overtime and other states have similar legislation pending 
in conjunction with the aforementioned factors  as the economy rebounds  the prospects for the healthcare staffing industry should improve as hospitals experience higher census levels and increasing shortages of healthcare workers 
acquisitions in  we purchased substantially all of the assets of two healthcare staffing companies for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we made no acquisitions 
in  we purchased substantially all of the assets of one healthcare staffing company for an aggregate purchase price of million 
all such acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  the results of these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates or the dates when we assumed substantial control 
discontinued operations we discontinued our physician staffing services in the second quarter of pursuant to the provisions of the fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 results of operations are to be classified as discontinued when the disposal of the component of an entity has occurred or it has met the held for sale criteria 
as such  the total is shown separately in the line item  income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we had a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million 
restructuring charge subsequent to fiscal year end  we initiated a plan to restructure our per diem nurse staffing division  due to the continued challenging market conditions 
this initiative includes certain per diem branch closures along with corresponding elimination of certain branch positions 
additionally  certain operations and corporate staff will be eliminated 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect to incur a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of the charge will be comprised of approximately million primarily related to severance costs and lease termination fees and approximately million in non cash goodwill impairment related to the branch closures 
we do not expect to realize the full benefits of this initiative until the third quarter of on june   we completed our plan to restructure our operations by closing branches 
the restructuring was necessary to adjust the infrastructure we had put in place to support multiple growth initiatives and was in response to the current contraction in demand for our services 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge  of approximately million  relating to employee severance costs  branch closing costs and lease termination costs 
the restructuring charge is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  no amounts have been or are expected to be incurred or paid in subsequent quarters relating to this restructuring 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in december  we entered into a new credit facility 
the million facility was comprised of a three year million revolving credit facility and a two year million term loan 
approximately million of proceeds from the credit facility were used to refinance all of our existing debt and to pay financing related fees 
the remaining borrowing availability was to be used for working capital and general business purposes 
as a result of the prepayment of the facility  we recorded a charge of approximately million to write off debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished facility 
the charge appears in the line item loss on early extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

statement r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 

sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
additionally  sfas no 
r amends the presentation of the statement of cash flows and requires additional annual disclosures 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies beginning with the first interim period that begins after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that postponed the effective date for sfas no 
r to the fiscal year beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
r on december   using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of apb no 
 and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options  as options granted under our plans have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
on december   our compensation committee accelerated the vesting of all of our unvested stock options awarded to employees under our stock incentive plan with the exception of three of our officers  who only had their options that were scheduled to vest in accelerated 
as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock representing approximately of the total outstanding options  which otherwise would have vested periodically over the next months  became immediately exercisable 
approximately of the accelerated options would have vested in if we had already adopted the fair value method  the acceleration of the options would have increased compensation expense by approximately million in and would have decreased compensation expense by approximately million in  million in and million in our compensation committee s decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was in response to the issuance of sfas no 
r 
by accelerating the vesting of these options  we have minimized the potential compensation expense that will be required to be recognized in future periods under sfas no 
r 
however  the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r  which is not expected to be material  cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  its impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in stock based compensation note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in accounting principles in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities at the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and a corresponding adjustment is to be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  it requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
it also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of adoption of this statement is not expected to be significant

the decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended december  was as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in the prior year

as a result of the above  we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the prior year 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  service revenues

seasonality due to the regional and seasonal fluctuations in the hospital patient census of our hospital and healthcare facility clients and due to the seasonal preferences for destinations by our temporary healthcare professionals  the number of healthcare professionals on assignment  revenue and earnings are subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas  particularly florida  that experience seasonal fluctuations in population  during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
historically  the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment has increased from december through march followed by declines or minimal growth from april through november 
this trend may or may not continue in the future 
as a result of all of these factors  results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
liquidity and capital resources discussion on liquidity and capital resources our historical capital resource requirements have been the funding of working capital  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we have historically funded these requirements from a combination of cash flow from operations  equity issuances and borrowings under our credit facilities 
cash flow from operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we used cash generated from operations to repay million of borrowings under our senior credit facility and capital lease obligations 
as of december   we had net working capital of million as compared to million as of december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
available borrowings under our senior credit facility is an important component of our liquidity 
on december   we entered into a new senior credit facility the senior credit facility which replaced the previous facility 
the senior credit facility provided a million revolving credit facility the revolver which expires in december and a million term loan the term loan which was due in december on june   we amended the senior credit facility to reduce the revolver capacity from million to million 
the amendment also favorably modified certain financial covenants while increasing the applicable margin on the revolver by and on the term loan by 
in conjunction with the amendment  on july   we repaid million of borrowings under the term loan 
the million can not be re borrowed under the terms of the term loan 
the impact of repaying the higher average interest rate borrowings under the term loan  offset partially by the marginally higher interest rates  will reduce the overall cost of capital under the senior credit facility going forward 
on february   we amended the terms of the senior credit facility whereby the term loan was reduced to million  the applicable margin for the term loan was reduced  the maturity of the term loan was extended to december and certain financial covenants were favorably amended 
the million term loan repayment was funded with borrowings under the revolver 
on september  and december   we amended the terms of the senior credit facility whereby certain financial covenants were favorably amended and the expiration date was extended to january  the amount that can be borrowed at any given time under the revolver is based on a formula that takes into account  among other things  eligible accounts receivable and an availability reserve  which can result in borrowing availability of less than the full capacity of the revolver 
the revolver bears interest at either prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin at december  with interest payable monthly or as interest rate contracts expire 
the term loan bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin at december  with interest payable as interest rate contacts expire 
unused capacity under the revolver bears interest at and is payable monthly 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the payment of dividends  restrict additional indebtedness and obligations  and require maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
as the borrower under the senior credit facility  our subsidiary  medical staffing network  inc  may only pay dividends or make other distributions to us in the amount of  in any fiscal year to pay our operating expenses 
this limitation on our subsidiary s ability to distribute cash to us will limit our ability to obtain and service any additional debt at the holding company level 
in addition  our subsidiary is subject to restrictions under the senior credit facility against incurring additional indebtedness 
for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate for the loans under the senior credit facility was 
as of december   the blended rate for loans outstanding under the senior credit facility was 
as of december   million was outstanding on the term loan and million was outstanding under the revolver 
as of december   an additional million was immediately available for borrowing under the revolver 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  and were million for the prior year 
the expenditures primarily relate to the upgrade or replacement of various computer systems including hardware  and purchased and internally developed software 
we expect a similar rate and type of capital expenditures on a going forward basis 
because we rely on cash flow from operations as a source of liquidity  we are subject to the risk that a decrease in the demand for our staffing services could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
decreased demand for our staffing services could result from an inability to attract qualified healthcare professionals  fluctuations in patient occupancy at our hospital and healthcare facility clients and changes in state and federal regulations relating to our business 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility and other available sources of liquidity  will be sufficient for us to meet our current and future financial obligations  as well as to provide us with funds for working capital  anticipated capital expenditures and other needs for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
in the longer term  we may require additional equity and debt financing to meet our working capital needs  or to fund our acquisition activities  if any 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations operating leases capital lease obligations total critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission sec release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we will evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
the adequacy of this allowance is determined by continually evaluating customer receivables  considering the customers financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we have recorded goodwill and other intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  through december   goodwill and other intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their lives of to years 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted in  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are no longer amortized 
during the year ended december   we reevaluated our reporting units and determined that each branch location represented a reporting unit  as opposed to viewing the entire company as one reporting unit previously 
we performed an analysis whereby the historical goodwill was allocated or pushed down to each reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed our annual review for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal by performing a fair value analysis of each reporting unit 
the fair value analysis was completed with the assistance of outside valuation professionals 
based on that analysis  no impairment was noted at any individual reporting unit 
accordingly  there was no financial impact in relating to the change in the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
we will continue to perform a reporting unit level fair value analysis impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year 
should impairment indicators be present  including branches not achieving their expected operating results  additional analysis will be performed to determine the extent of any impairment and the associated charge will be recorded to the statement of operations 
should we decide to exit a market and close one or more of our reporting units  the associated goodwill will be written off with a charge to the statement of operations 
although it does not affect our cash flow  an impairment charge to earnings has the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses  as the case may be 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on results of operations 
subsequent to year end  we decided to close certain per diem nurse branches 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we will take a charge of approximately million to write down the associated impaired goodwill 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability that are either self insured or partially self insured and are classified in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the adequacy of these accruals is determined by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on company specific actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that the accruals are overstated or understated  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in the methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
caution concerning forward looking statements the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this document contains such forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  particularly statements anticipating future growth in revenues  operating income and cash flow 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include the following our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and other healthcare personnel  the overall level of demand for services provided by temporary nurses  our ability to enter into contracts with hospital and healthcare facility clients on terms attractive to us  the willingness of hospital and healthcare facility clients to utilize temporary healthcare staffing services  the general level of patient occupancy at hospital and healthcare facility clients  the functioning of our information systems  the effect of existing or future government regulation and federal and state legislative and enforcement initiatives on our business  our clients ability to pay for services  our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and integration strategies  the effect of liabilities and other claims asserted against us  the effect of competition in the markets we serve  and our ability to carry out our business strategy 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  we cannot guarantee future results 
given these uncertainties  the forward looking statements discussed herein might not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility that were subject to variable rates  with a blended rate of 
as of december   an adverse change of in the interest rate of all such borrowings outstanding would have caused us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
foreign currency risk we have no foreign currency risk as we have no revenue outside the united states and all of our revenues are in us dollars 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years and periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future
