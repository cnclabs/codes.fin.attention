item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  accounting for our contract related revenues and costs as well as other cost items requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reliable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations 

table of contents weather can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work is significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature 
changes in weather conditions can create significant variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease its profitability 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
the single largest factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment 
we work in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
an inability to secure and permit aggregate reserves could negatively impact our future operations and results 
tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure and permit aggregate reserves 
although we have thus far been able to secure and permit reserves to support our business  it is likely to become increasingly difficult to do so and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure and permit reserves in the future 
we are subject to environmental and other regulation 
as more fully described under government and environmental regulations above  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and workplace safety  the noncompliance of which can result in substantial penalties as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a substantial portion of our craft workforce 
although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations if they occur in the future 
unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and due to requirements to maintain specific coverage in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts 
although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
as more fully described in insurance and bonding above  we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts 
our inability to obtain surety bonds in the future would significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform we could be liable for completion of the entire contract and  if the contract were unprofitable  this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
diesel fuel  asphalt oil and other petroleum based products are used to fuel and lube our equipment and operate our hot materials processing plants and are a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and are sold to outside parties 
although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts  not all contracts provide such protection 
we also use cement  steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have not been significantly adversely effected by price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future 
as a part of our growth strategy we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve many risks 
these risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention  potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities  record goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges and incur amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results significantly 

table of contents failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
as further described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  we subcontract a portion of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors and we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors  and there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
our long term debt and credit arrangements contain restrictive covenants and failure to meet these covenants could significantly harm our financial condition 
our long term debt and credit arrangements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in most cases  failure to meet the restrictive covenants would result in an immediate repayment liability for all amounts due and cancellation of open lines of credit 
additionally  failure to meet restrictive covenants related to our debt and credit agreements would trigger cross default provisions that would cause us to also be in default of our surety agreements 
although we have not had difficulty meeting these covenants in the past  failure to do so in the future could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

item legal proceedings eldredge a million judgment was entered in june against our wholly owned subsidiary granite construction company gcco by the district court clark county  nevada  in an action entitled eldredge vs 
las vegas valley water district  gcco  et al 
the civil lawsuit was initially brought by a former employee of gcco against the las vegas water district in june the plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint on june   bringing gcco into the action and seeking compensation in addition to the worker s compensation payments the employee previously accepted for injuries sustained when a trench excavation collapsed 
the jury issued a verdict finding against gcco on two causes of action  assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the judgment awarded damages for past and future lost wages  medical expenses and pain and suffering 
although no punitive damages were assessed  gcco s insurance carriers have denied coverage for this judgment 
on june   gcco filed several post trial motions seeking reconsideration by the trial court as well as a reduction in the amount of the judgment 
these post trial motions were heard in september if we do not agree with the judge s rulings on these post trial motions  we intend to pursue an appeal 
we anticipate that the appeal process will take between and months to complete 
during the three months ended june   we recorded a provision of million  which was estimated based on the amount of the judgment described above 
the judgment will accrue interest until it is satisfied 

table of contents after the verdict was issued  the plaintiff filed a motion seeking monetary sanctions against gcco in the amount of million a multiple of the jury verdict based on allegations that gcco and or its trial counsel improperly withheld and or attempted to influence testimony in respect to the case 
gcco s opposition to the motion and the plaintiff s reply have been filed with the court 
we believe that the plaintiff has failed to submit any meaningful proof to support these allegations  that the motion is without merit and that it is highly unlikely that the motion will be granted 
the judge decided after the sanctions motion was heard in september to reserve any decision until after the appeal and calendared the motion for a status check in september wasatch constructors gcco  as a member of a joint venture  wasatch constructors  is among a number of construction companies that were named along with the utah department of transportation in a lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the district of utah 
the plaintiffs are two independent contractor truckers who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the united states under the federal false claims act seeking to recover damages and civil penalties in excess of million 
the original complaint was filed in january  and the third amended complaint was filed in february on october   the district court granted wasatch constructors motion to dismiss the entire case 
the court dismissed the case with prejudice and without leave to amend 
the plaintiffs did not appeal the court s decision to dismiss  and the time to file such an appeal has expired 
silica gcco is one of approximately to defendants in six active california superior court lawsuits  four of which were served against granite in and two were served in  in alameda county riley v 
a aggregates  et al  molina v a aggregates  et al  dominguez v a aggregates  et al  cleveland v 
a 
teichert son  guido v 
a 
teichert son  inc  and williams v a 
teichert son  inc 
each lawsuit was brought by a single plaintiff who  by way of various causes of action  including strict product and market share liability  alleges personal injuries caused by exposure to silica products and related materials during the plaintiffs use or association with sand blasting or grinding concrete 
the plaintiff in each lawsuit has categorized the defendants as equipment defendants  respirator defendants  premises defendants and sand defendants 
we have been identified as a sand defendant  meaning a party that manufactured  supplied or distributed silica containing products 
our preliminary investigation revealed that we have not knowingly sold or distributed abrasive silica sand for sandblasting  and therefore  we believe the probability of these lawsuits resulting in an incurrence of a material liability is remote 
we have been dismissed from seven other similar lawsuits  six of which were served in and one that was served in in addition  we have been apprised of two complaints that are based on similar allegations of exposure to silica containing products being filed  but not served  against gcco and more than one hundred other defendants in california superior court 
we are investigating the specific allegations against gcco for these new complaints 
other we are a party to a number of other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business and believe that the nature and number of these proceedings are typical for a construction firm of our size and scope 
our litigation typically involves claims regarding public liability or contract related issues 
while management currently believes  after consultation with counsel  that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows and or financial position for the period in which the ruling occurs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airport infrastructure  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we have offices in alaska  arizona  california  florida  minnesota  nevada  new york  oregon  texas  utah and washington 
our business involves two operating segments the branch division and the heavy construction division 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
the two primary economic drivers of our business are federal  state and local public funding levels and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and locally 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a weak economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for fewer private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
a weak economy also tends to produce less tax revenue  thereby decreasing the funds available for spending on public infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as gasoline taxes  which are not necessarily directly impacted by a weak economy 
however  even these funds can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
conversely  higher public funding and or a robust economy will increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign project employees to estimating and bidding activities until another project gets underway  temporarily moving their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in very profitable years and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
current year overview comparative financial summary years ended december  in thousands revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses provision for legal judgment gain on sale of property and equipment operating income net income our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect significantly higher operating income from our branch division compared with the corresponding period in  which were primarily driven by the strong private sector market in the west and the ability to work well into the fourth quarter due to mild weather conditions 
branch division operating results also include the recognition of a provision related to an unfavorable legal judgment in the second quarter of our heavy construction division did experience some improvement in operating income in compared with hcd gross profit in and includes a reduction in gross profit for the net effects of changes in estimates of project profitability of million and million  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  the valuation of long lived assets and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog has increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized using the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders  which occur in most large projects  is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the threshold is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 

table of contents the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have many projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time during we worked on over  projects these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger  more complex projects in our heavy construction division  have had and can in future periods have a significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due primarily to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we had approximately million in goodwill at december   million relating to hcd and million relating to our branch division 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently when events and circumstances occur that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded using a discounted future cash flow method 
we then compare the resulting fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment test in and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
the discounted future cash flow method used in the first step of our impairment test involves significant estimates including future cash inflows from estimated revenues  future cash outflows from estimated project cost and general and administrative costs  estimates of timing of collection and payment of various items and future growth rates as well as discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
insurance estimates we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first  to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would result in a change in our assessment of the ultimate liability that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

this private sector demand was also a major factor in the increased sales of materials in california  which grew by million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  a portion of the branch division increase was also attributable to mild weather in the fourth quarter of which enabled many of our locations to complete more work in the quarter than in the fourth quarter of

table of contents gross profit years ended december  in thousands branch division gross profit percent of division revenue heavy construction division gross profit percent of division revenue other total gross profit percent of revenue gross profit as more fully described under critical accounting estimates we recognize revenue only equal to cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches completion 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in our branch division  this policy generally has very little impact on the branch division s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  hcd has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than branch division projects 
as a result  hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach completion and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross margin recognition 
revenue from projects less than complete  for which no margin has been recognized  is as follows revenue from contracts less than complete years ended december  in thousands branch division heavy construction division total revenue from contracts less than complete additionally  as we also describe under critical accounting estimates we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders when they are incurred 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary during periods where a large volume of change orders or contract claims are pending resolution reducing gross profit percent or  conversely  during periods where large change orders or contract claims are agreed or settled increasing gross profit percent 
although this variability can occur in both our branch division and hcd  it can be much more pronounced in hcd because of the larger size of their projects 
gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division increased to in from in gross profit margins for both construction and the sale of materials in the branch division reflected our ability to capitalize on the continued strong private development market in many of the division s locations 
hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue in and of and  respectively  reflected the impact of downward revisions in the estimated profitability of certain contracts 
the net impact of these estimate changes on recognized gross profit during was a reduction in gross profit of approximately million 
this compares with a net reduction in gross profit in of approximately million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have entitlement to additional compensation related to some of these projects and are actively pursuing these claims with the contract owners 
however  the amount and timing of any future recovery is highly uncertain 
while we recognize the impact of estimated costs immediately when known  under our accounting policies we do not recognize revenue from contract changes until we have a signed change order or executed claim settlement 
other gross profit in is primarily related to sales of certain real estate development projects by consolidated subsidiaries of approximately million 
the minority partners share of this gross profit amount was approximately million 

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands salaries and related expenses incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation other general and administrative expenses total percent of revenue general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from to salaries and related expenses increased in due primarily to additional staffing needed to support a higher volume of work 
incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation increased in due to higher profitability 
the increase in other general administrative costs in related primarily to increased bidding activity and other costs related to higher revenue volume 
additionally  other general and administrative expense includes million related to a reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of against a million receivable that we accepted as a partial payment for work on a large private mass transit project which became operational in the latter half of the receivable is part of a series of bonds that formed the basis for the project owners funding for the entire project and is payable out of future fare revenues 
in march  one of the two services rating a series of these bonds reduced their rating to below investment grade 
on february   the second rating service also reduced its rating  citing serious concerns about whether the project s fare revenues would be adequate to pay the series of bonds that we hold 
there is currently no market for these bonds and we have determined that a reserve of of the carrying amount is appropriate 
other general and administrative costs also includes information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expenses

the decrease in equity in income of affiliates in was due to approximately million in gain recorded in related to the sale of certain assets by two partnerships in which we hold an equity method investment 
the decrease in other  net in was due to a gain recognized in the fourth quarter of on the sale of certain shares of tic holdings  inc tic back to tic see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents provision for income taxes years ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due in part to an increase in our partners share of consolidated construction joint venture income 
generally  our construction joint ventures are not subject to income taxes on a stand alone basis 
also contributing to the decreased effective tax rate in was the impact of a deduction based on income from qualified domestic production activities under the american jobs creation act of minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries years ended december  in thousands minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries our minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority owners share of the income of our consolidated subsidiaries  primarily wilder construction company  certain real estate development entities and various consolidated construction joint ventures 
the increase in minority interest in compared with is due to higher profitability of these entities in 
table of contents outlook as we begin our construction season  we are encouraged by the strong demand for our goods and services  the improved outlook for public funding of transportation projects and the momentum of our branch division business in the west 
we are also encouraged by the work our team in our heavy construction division has been doing to turn this business around and we expect to see continued incremental bottom line improvement going forward 
hcd is experiencing significant bidding opportunities across the us while we are not focusing on growing the division s revenues  the current market is allowing us to exhibit more discipline on bid day in an effort to improve the profitability of our projects 
our strategy is to prepare quality bids  execute on our project plan and deliver the bottom line performance improvement we need from this business 
our branch division is experiencing the best market we have seen in many years 
both the public and private sector markets are strong in most of the areas in which we work and are contributing to a healthy demand for our construction services and materials 
in the public sector  funding for transportation  particularly in california  our largest market  is promising 
according to caltrans  new caltrans contracting was approximately million in fiscal and is expected to increase to billion in fiscal once allocations by the california transportation commission are completed 
with additional funding from the recently passed highway bill and proposed early repayment of proposition loans  it is anticipated that caltrans contracting levels may reach the billion range in fiscal caltrans funding for transportation projects is primarily driven by revenues from taxes on gasoline  truck weight fees and federal programs 
we continue to be busy in the private sector market as well 
we have worked hard over the past several years to cultivate relationships in this market and believe those efforts are paying off 
it is also important to note that in addition to the benefits provided directly to our business  a strong private sector market absorbs capacity in the marketplace as well 
as we have historically seen  this tends to help create a market which typically will support higher margins 
we anticipate our aggregates business will remain strong 
the ownership of aggregate materials is proving to be extremely valuable both as a resource for our core construction business as well as a strategic and profitable retail business 
our long term plan is to continue to invest in this part of our business by acquiring additional aggregate reserves  permitting or green fielding new facilities and expanding our existing operations 
our industry continues to be challenged with a shortage of skilled labor and we expect the industry will continue to face this challenge as the demand for construction related services remains strong or grows across the united states 
at granite  we are working diligently to implement specialized training programs to develop our people and improve their skills 
our investment in our employee development initiative is an important strategy that we believe will allow us to turn the shortage of labor in the marketplace into an advantage for granite 
as we have stated previously  we are subject to oil price volatility as it relates to our use of liquid asphalt and diesel fuel 
some of our projects are indexed and include price escalation clauses that provide protection in the event that petroleum product prices increase significantly 
although we are exposed to price spikes in projects that do not include such clauses  we have historically been able to recover some or all of those costs when prices come down 
with respect to steel  we are exposed to price increases and steel delivery delays on some of our hcd projects that are currently under construction 
while we do have some exposure in these areas of our business  we have not been materially adversely impacted to date 
in an effort to minimize our exposure on future projects  we are closely monitoring the industry s outlook on future pricing so that we can properly reflect anticipated future price escalation in our bids 
in summary  we look forward to the year ahead 
we are encouraged by the strength of our markets and the opportunities for our branch division business in both the private and public sectors 
our top priority for hcd remains the safe and successful execution of our work and the incremental improvement of our bottom line financial performance 

table of contents prior years revenue revenue from our branch division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in branch division revenue primarily reflected increases in private sector construction revenue and sales of construction materials as a result of the increase in demand created by the continuing strong housing market in california and other branch division locations 
the increase in revenue from construction materials was also due to increases in both unit volume and average sales price of certain products  which we believe reflected an appreciation in the market for the growing scarcity of finite aggregate resources and the results of our strategic focus on maximizing revenue from external sales of materials 
public sector revenue as a percent of total branch revenue remained relatively unchanged compared with as increased local government agency revenue was largely offset by a reduction in state government agency work  particularly in california 
we continued to experience reduced awards from the california state department of transportation due to ongoing budgetary uncertainty in the state 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  included in hcd revenue for the year ended december  was million all in the public sector resulting from the consolidation of our partners share of construction joint venture revenue under fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the increase over was due primarily to results from a higher backlog at the beginning of  particularly in the northeast 
backlog backlog in our heavy construction division at december  was  million  an increase of million  or  from backlog at december  included in hcd backlog at december  was million resulting from the consolidation of our partners share of construction joint venture backlog under fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the increase resulted from new awards in california and in the south  partially offset by a reduction in the northeast and reflected changes primarily in public sector backlog 
additions to hcd backlog in the fourth quarter of included a million design build bridge project in florida  a million highway project in texas and a million transit structure project in new york 
branch division backlog at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the december  level 
the increase was due primarily to higher backlog in the private sector for projects located throughout the west  including california  due largely to the continued strong demand in the housing sector 
public sector backlog increases in states other than california were generally offset by a decrease in california  where ongoing budgetary issues have had a negative impact on the amount of funding available for infrastructure projects 
branch division awards in the fourth quarter of included a million bridge project in alaska and a million sewer pipeline project in california 
gross profit revenue from projects that were less than complete was million in and million in included in revenue from projects less than complete for the year ended december  is million resulting from the consolidation of our partners share of construction joint venture backlog under fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase in revenue from projects less than complete had the effect of reducing our overall gross margin 
no significant claim revenue was recognized in either or gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division decreased slightly in as compared with reflecting normal variability in the mix of work performed during the year 
the decrease in hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue in as compared with was due primarily to downward revisions in certain profit forecasts due to additional estimated costs to complete 
the net impact of these estimate changes on recognized gross profit during was a reduction in gross profit of approximately million  of which approximately million was recognized in the fourth quarter 
included in the net impact of this change in estimate in both the quarter and year ended december  was approximately million representing our partners proportionate share see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of this change in estimate related to downward revisions of ten projects 
the amount attributable to each project ranged from approximately million to million 
the cost estimate changes resulted from a variety of factors including costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  design problems on design build projects  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations and higher estimated liquidated damages on two projects 
at december   six of these projects were greater than complete  two were greater than complete and the remaining two projects averaged complete 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million from to salaries and related expenses increased in due primarily to additional staffing needed to support a higher volume of work 
incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation decreased in due to lower profitability in the increase in other general administrative costs in related to increased bidding activity and higher revenue volume as well as costs associated with complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of other general and administrative costs included information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expenses 
gain on sales of property and equipment gain on sales of property and equipment increased by million from to due primarily to the million gain on sale of certain assets related to our redi mix concrete business in utah in march other income expense equity in income of affiliates primarily comprised income from our equity method investment in two land development partnerships in the year ended december  and million in income related to the sale of the state route toll road franchise by the california private transportation corporation  of which we are a limited partner in the year ended december  provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due primarily to the inclusion in our pre tax income of the minority interest in the income of our consolidated construction joint ventures as required by fin  which are generally not subject to income taxes on a stand alone basis  and a lower overall state tax rate  net of federal tax benefit  due to changes in the mix of earnings in differing tax jurisdictions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  acquisitions and other investments 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities totaled million at december  and included million of cash from our consolidated joint ventures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this joint venture cash is for the working capital needs of each joint venture s project 
the decision to distribute cash must generally be made jointly by all of the partners 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next months and beyond 
if we experience a significant change in our business such as the execution of a significant acquisition  we would likely need to acquire additional sources of financing  which may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants  or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities in contributing to this increase were higher net income in the year ended december   an increase in net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  compared with december  the increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was due primarily to cash payments received to mobilize several projects in the early stages of construction and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was largely due to growth in costs related to revenue growth in partially offsetting these items was an increase in accounts receivable of million from december  to december  included in this increase is approximately million related to an increase in accounts receivable retention provisions in our contracts  which are generally due upon completion of the projects and acceptance by the project owner 
the growth in retention receivable is largely due to an increase in the number of large hcd projects that were nearing completion at december  compared with the same period in cash used by investing activities of million in represents a million increase from the amount used by investing activities in the increase was largely due to higher net additions to property and equipment in compared with cash used by financing activities was million in  an increase of million from the increase was mainly due to lower proceeds from long term debt in compared with  which included million advanced under our bank revolving line of credit 
this was partially offset by lower net distributions to our minority partners in our consolidated construction joint ventures 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations outstanding as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations under construction contracts other purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations wilder stock repurchase obligation total these obligations represent the aggregate minimum principal maturities of long term debt and do not include interest 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these obligations represent the minimum rental commitments and minimum royalty requirements under all noncancellable operating leases 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these obligations represent our best estimate of future purchases of materials and subcontract services related to our current contract backlog 
these obligations represent firm purchase commitments for equipment and other goods and services not connected with our construction backlog which are individually greater than  and have an expected purchase after february  the timing of expected payment of deferred compensation is based on estimated dates of retirement 
actual dates of retirement could be different and would cause the timing of payments to change 
the timing of expected payment for redemptions is based on estimates including dates of retirement which could differ from actual dates of retirement and would cause the timing of payments to change 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock of which million remained at december  in addition  we are authorized to purchase shares for contribution to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire between february and october we are generally required by the beneficiaries of these standby letters of credit to replace them upon expiration 
additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 
on june   we entered into an agreement for a million bank revolving line of credit  which replaced the million line of credit we entered into in june the new revolving line of credit allows for unsecured borrowings for up to five years through june   with interest rate options 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit is at our choice of selected libor rates plus a margin that is recalculated quarterly 
the margin was at december  the unused and available portion of this line of credit was million at december  restrictive covenants under the terms of our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  additionally  our wilder subsidiary has restrictive covenants on a wilder stand alone basis under the terms of its debt agreements that include the maintenance of certain ratios of working capital  liabilities to net worth and tangible net worth and restricts wilder capital expenditures in excess of specified limits 
wilder was in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 

table of contents joint ventures we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of the prospective venturers construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  however  if one of our partners is unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
we also participate in various line item joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work 
the revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated with its own work 
all partners in a line item joint venture are jointly and severally liable for the completion of the total project under the terms of the contract with the project owner 
there is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture 
each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self performed contract 
we account for our portion of these contracts as project revenues and costs in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work in our consolidated financial statements 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures provide that each party will assume and pay its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december  approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share of unconsolidated construction joint ventures or work that our partners are directly responsible for in line item joint ventures  had yet to be completed 
we have never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however  it is possible that we could in the future and such a loss could be significant
