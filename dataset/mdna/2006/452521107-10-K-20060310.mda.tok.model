part i item business overview immersion corporation was founded in  and we consummated our initial public offering on november  our common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol immr 
immersion corporation is a leading provider of haptic technologies that allow people to use their sense of touch more fully when operating a wide variety of digital devices 
to achieve this heightened interactivity  we develop and manufacture or license a wide range of hardware and software technologies and products 
while we believe that our technologies are broadly applicable  we are currently focusing our marketing and business development activities on the following target application areas automotive  consumer  entertainment  industrial  medical simulation  mobile communications  and three dimensional design and simulation 
we manage these application areas under two operating and reportable segments immersion computing  entertainment  and industrial and immersion medical 
in markets where our touch technologies are a small piece of a larger system  such as mobile phones and controls for automotive interfaces  we license our technologies or software products to manufacturers who integrate them into their products and sell the end product s under their own brand names 
in some markets  we have brand visibility on consumer packaging  end user documentation  and in software applications 
in other markets  such as medical simulation  touchscreen input devices  and three dimensional computer aided design  we manufacture and sell products under our own immersion brand name  through direct sales  distributors  and value added resellers 
in all market areas  we also engage in development projects for third parties and government agencies from time to time 
our objective is to drive adoption of our touch technologies across markets and applications to improve the user experience with digital devices and systems 
we and our wholly owned subsidiaries hold more than issued or pending patents in the us and other countries  covering various aspects of hardware and software technologies 
haptics and its benefits the science of haptics refers to tactile and kinesthetic information that supplies a tangible representation of the environment to the human sensory system 
the term force feedback has often been used to mean haptics in general  though haptics is actually comprised of two types of sensing and two types of technologies 
tactile sensing refers to an awareness through stimulation of the skin  which can be accessed through vibro tactile technologies 

table of contents kinesthetic sensing refers to an awareness through the position of body parts and their movement  which can be accessed using force feedback technologies 
without our perception of haptic information  it would be hard to believe that something is tangible 
unlike sight and hearing  which are mainly input systems  touch is bi directional  allowing us to both feel take in information and manipulate have an effect on something 
all human senses are complementary  contributing to our perception of the environment 
without one of them  our perception would change and without touch  any motor action  such as typing  peeling an orange  or opening a door would be extremely difficult 
a person s sense of touch and the haptic information it interprets is a critical part of our interactions with the world 
in the world of computers and digital devices and controls  haptic feedback is often lost 
to replace the lost sensation of touch  input output devices can create the physical forces  known as haptic feedback  force feedback  touch feedback  or tactile feedback 
these forces are exerted by actuators  usually motors  which are built into consumer devices such as joysticks  steering wheels  gamepads  and mobile phones 
actuators can also be designed into more sophisticated devices used in automotive  industrial  medical  or retail kiosk and point of sale systems  such as digital switches  rotary controls  and touchscreens 
our programmable haptic technologies embedded in touch enabled devices can give users the physical sensations of interacting with rough textures  smooth surfaces  viscous liquids  compliant springs  solid barriers  deep or shallow detents  jarring vibrations  heavy masses  and rumbling engines 
as a user operates a touch enabled device  such as a joystick  motors within the device apply computer modulated forces that resist  assist  and enhance the manipulations 
these forces are generated based on software algorithms and mathematical models built to produce appropriate sensations 
for example  when simulating the feel of interacting with a solid wall or barrier  a computer program can signal motors within a force feedback joystick to apply forces that emulate the impenetrability of the wall 
the harder the user pushes  the harder the motors push back 
when simulating the placement of cardiac pacing leads  a computer program can signal actuators to apply forces that would be encountered when navigating coronary pacing leads through a beating heart 
these forces can be synchronized with appropriate simulations of an electrocardiogram  blood pressure  heart rate  and fluoroscopy displays 
when simulating the feel of pressing a button  a computer program can signal actuators attached to a touchscreen to apply forces that emulate the button s particular press and release characteristics 
even though the user touches a screen that is flat  our technology delivers the perception that the button is pushed inward 
for mobile phones  our software can control the motor used in substantially all phone models  thereby enhancing the output from a simple on off buzz to a rich palette of tactile communications 
our programmable haptic system can be used  for example  to advise users of the identity of an incoming caller  supply vibrations signifying an emotion in a text message  provide a tactile alert  and aid in general navigation and operation 
ringtones can also be haptically enhanced  allowing users to feel the beat of a particular song 
mobile games are made more engaging and enjoyable by adding vibro tactile effects to particular events such as explosions  car crashes  and bowling strikes 
the mathematical models that control motors may be simple modulating forces based on a function of time 
these forces can produce jolts and vibrations for example 
more complex forces can emulate surfaces  textures  springs  and damping 
all forces can be synchronized with audio  video  or application program logic 
for example  a series of individual simulated forces can be combined to give the seamless feel of a complex interaction  like driving a sports car  which might include the centrifugal forces in the steering wheel  the vibration of the road surface  the revving of the engine  and the bass beat of a song 
we believe the programmability of our haptic products is a key differentiator over purely electro mechanical systems and can drive the further adoption of digital devices 
a programmable device can supply a tactile response appropriate to the context of operation for systems and devices of many types 
these tactile cues can help users operate more intuitively or realize a more enjoyable or natural experience 
used in combination with sight and sound cues  touch feedback adds a compelling  engaging  multimodal aspect to the user interface 
our haptic products and technologies can also add a tactile quality to interactions that have been devoid of tactile confirmation  such as when using a touchpad or touchscreen 
the confirmation and navigational cues obtained by programmable haptics can aid in performance and accuracy and increase user satisfaction 
the addition of programmable haptics 
table of contents can help in the conversion from purely mechanical rotary controls to digital devices or from a mechanical keyboard  switch  or button interface to an electronic touchscreen 
programmability also supplies more flexibility in terms of the types of responses that are possible such as nonlinear or dynamic qualities  in upgradeability  in consistent performance that will not degrade over time  and in the potential for personalized settings 
multiple mechanical controls can be consolidated into one versatile programmable control  which can save space and improve ergonomics 
conversely  one programmable control device can be implemented as many different types of controls with context appropriate touch feedback  which can simplify inventory 
industry background haptic systems were first used in applications like military flight simulators 
in the s  combat pilots honed their flight skills in training simulators that replicated the feel of flying actual planes 
motors and actuators pushed  pulled  and shook the flight yoke  throttle  rudder pedals  and cockpit shell  reproducing many of the tactile and kinesthetic cues of real flight 
though advanced for their time  these systems were limited by the then available technology and were therefore relatively crude and low fidelity by today s standards 
they also cost at least hundreds of thousands  if not millions of dollars  and therefore were not within the grasp of consumers or even most businesses 
by the late s and early s  computing power reached the point where rich color graphics and high quality audio were possible 
computers evolved from primitive command prompt  text based systems with monochrome displays to powerful systems capable of rendering colorful graphics and animations and of playing music and sound effects 
these advancements spawned entirely new businesses in the late s and early s 
to the consumer  this multimedia revolution opened new possibilities 
flight simulation moved from a professional pilot only activity to a pc based hobby for millions of real and aspiring pilots 
the graphics and sound these hobbyists experienced were far superior to what the combat pilots in the s had in their expensive flight simulator systems 
the multimedia revolution also made the medical simulation business possible 
by the s  high end workstations enabled renderings of the human anatomy to be displayed with never before possible realism 
companies were founded to harness this new technology and turn it into safer and more effective teaching aides for medical personnel 
however  the multimedia revolution also highlighted a shortcoming in simulation products 
even though medical graphics and animations looked incredibly realistic  they could not possibly convey what it actually feels like to break through a venal wall with a needle or cut through the tissue surrounding the gall bladder 
in the case of flight simulation  graphics and sound could not possibly convey what it actually feels like to fight the flight yoke or flight stick out of a steep dive or through a sharply banked turn 
only hands on experience provided this critical component of learning 
so by the mid s  these new industrial and consumer multimedia products were in need of enhanced haptic technology that could provide the sensations similar to an actual hands on experience 
we were founded in to bring the critical sense of touch back into the user s experience 
by combining the basic concepts used in the military flight simulators of the s  state of the art advancements in robotic controls  advancements in the understanding of how the human sense of touch works  and advancements in computing power  we were able to significantly reduce the cost and size of haptic solutions while increasing the quality of the simulated forces 
some of our early technology was used in the world s first consumer force feedback peripherals for computer video games  such as flight sticks and steering wheels 
these products not only looked and sounded more realistic  they allowed users to feel haptic effects that simulated  for example  textures  bouncing and hitting a ball  and vibrations from gun fire 
in addition  with our technology  sophisticated medical simulators offered medical professionals the ability to practice and enhance their surgical and other procedural skills in a way not previously possible 
continued advancements in size  power  and cost reductions have pushed the adoption of haptics technology even further into those industries  as well as into new ones 
our touchsense technology is now incorporated into 
table of contents computer and console gaming systems  and in products such as gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels for sony s playstation and playstation  microsoft s xbox and xbox  nintendo s gamecube  and the pc and apple macintosh computer 
furthermore  more than  immersion medical simulators have been deployed at hospitals and medical schools throughout the united states and abroad  including beth israel deaconess medical center  mayo clinic rochester  mn  northwestern university  rush university medical center  st 
mary s hospital london  and stanford university 
over the past few years  the ever increasing demands of connectivity  interactivity  and functionality have driven advancements in mobile phone capabilities 
improvements focused on processing power  data communications bandwidth  operating system sophistication  and memory  as well as user interface design  high resolution color displays  stereo speakers  and motor and case design 
as a result  our touchsense software and technology used in the gaming market is now being deployed as vibetonz software products for mobile phone handsets 
although the first touchscreens were introduced in the early s  their broad acceptance and proliferation didn t occur until the mid to late s 
since their introduction  advancements in computing power  operating systems  graphical user interfaces  and multimedia software  combined with gradual cost reductions  have today made the touchscreen the user interface device of choice for many applications 
in  we announced a touchsense technology solution to enable enhanced tactile cues for providing a more intuitive  personal  and natural experience for the user 
instead of just feeling the passive touchscreen surface  users perceive that buttons press and release  just as physical buttons and switches do  creating a class of products we call active touchscreens 
our haptic technologies are also now used by corporate industrial designers and by researchers from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  stanford university  and the massachusetts institute of technology mit 
automobiles manufactured by bmw  mercedes benz  rolls royce  and volkswagen use programmable haptic controls powered by immersion technology 
in addition  we offer d capture and interaction products to help game developers  mechanical designers  animators  and other professionals reduce production time and streamline the workflow process 
today  we believe that as computing power increases and pushes multimedia capabilities into new areas  even more opportunities will be created for our programmable haptic technologies 
our solutions our goal is to change the way people interact with digital devices by engaging their sense of touch 
core competencies include our understanding of how interactions should feel and our knowledge of how to use technology to achieve that feeling 
our strength in both of these areas has resulted in many novel applications 
we believe that our touch enabled products and technologies give users a more complete  intuitive  enjoyable  and realistic experience 
our patented designs include software elements such as real time software algorithms and authoring tools  and specialized hardware elements  such as motors  sensors  transmissions  and control electronics 
together  these software and hardware elements enable tactile sensations that are context appropriate within the application 
we have developed haptic systems for many types of hardware input output devices such as computer mice  joysticks  mobile phones  rotary devices  touchscreens  and flexible and rigid endoscopy devices for medical simulations 
we have developed many mechanisms to convey forces to the user s hands or body 
these include vibro tactile actuators  direct drive or cable driven mechanisms  and other proprietary devices that supply textures and vibration  resistance  and damping forces to the user 
to develop our real time electronic actuator controllers  we had to address challenges such as size  accuracy  resolution  frequency  latency requirements  power consumption  and cost 
our control solutions include both closed loop and open loop control schemes 
in closed loop control  the firmware reads inputs from the input output devices  and then calculates and applies the output forces in real time based upon the input data 
in open loop control  a triggering event will activate the firmware to calculate and send the output signal to the actuator in real time

table of contents companies may develop products that compete with products employing our touch enabling technologies  but are based on alternative technologies  or develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies  or design around our patents 
many of our licensees  including microsoft  logitech  samsung  and others have greater financial and technical resources upon which to draw in attempting to develop computer peripheral or mobile phone technologies that do not make use of our touch enabling technologies 
with respect to our microscribe product line  we believe the g model  aimed primarily at the design  animation  and reverse engineering markets  competes favorably with other digitizing technologies  such as laser scanning and sonic systems  and with other articulated arm models  which are all of higher accuracy and higher price than these markets generally require 
the microscribe mx model  aimed at high accuracy manufactured parts inspection and reverse engineering markets  competes favorably on price to other coordinated measurement machine cmm models manufactured by faro technologies and romer cimcore which is a part of hexagon ab 
it also competes favorably with these competitors for many types of projects where accuracy measurement tolerances are greater than inch 
sensable technologies currently sells high end d sculpting and design products that employ haptics 
we believe that sensable s products compete on some level with our d interaction products 
competitors to our cyberglove data glove include fifth dimension technologies  phoenix technologies  and measurand 
for licensed applications  our competitive position is partially dependent on the competitive positions of our licensees that pay a per unit royalty 
our licensees markets are highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our licensees markets include price  performance  user centric design  ease of use  quality  and timeliness of products  as well as the manufacturer s responsiveness  capacity  technical abilities  established customer relationships  retail shelf space  advertising  promotional programs  and brand recognition 
touch related benefits in some of these markets may be viewed simply as enhancements and compete with nontouch enabled technologies 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights for any reason could hurt our competitive position 
there is no guarantee that patents will be issued from the patent applications that we have filed or may file 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or issued in the proper geographic regions  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
immersion medical products and markets we have developed numerous simulation technologies that can be used for medical training and testing 
by enabling a medical simulator to more fully engage users sense of touch  our technologies can support realistic simulations that are effective in teaching medical students  doctors  and other health professionals what it feels like to perform a given procedure 
the use of our simulators allows these professionals to perfect their practice in an environment that poses no risks to patients  where mistakes have no dire consequences  and where animal or cadaver use is minimized 
we partner with leading medical technology companies  such as medtronic inc and terumo cardiovascular systems corporation  to develop products that closely simulate not only the look  but also the feel  of performing actual medical procedures 
we have five medical simulation product lines the cathsim accutouch system  which simulates vascular access procedures such as intravenous catheterization and phlebotomy  the endoscopy accutouch system  which simulates endoscopy procedures  including bronchoscopy and lower and upper gi endoscopic procedures  the endovascular accutouch system  which simulates endovascular interventions  including cardiac pacing  angiography  angioplasty  and carotid and coronary stent placement  the laparoscopy accutouch system  consisting of simulation hardware that can be integrated with third party software for laparoscopic surgical procedure simulation  and the hysteroscopy accutouch system  which simulates hysteroscopy procedures 
these systems are used for training and educational purposes to enable health professionals to feel simulated forces that they would experience during actual medical procedures  such as encountering an unexpected obstruction in an artery 
the 
table of contents systems provide a realistic training environment augmented by real time graphics that include anatomic models developed from actual patient data and high fidelity sound that includes simulated patient responses 
all our accutouch products  except for the laparoscopic system  are comprised of a hardware system  an interface device  and software modules that include several cases of increasing difficulty  allowing users to develop their skills by experiencing a broad range of pathologies in differing anatomical conditions 
we design each product line to maximize the number of procedures that can be simulated with minimal additional customer hardware investment 
these systems then enable potential additional sales of software to the installed base of hardware systems 
we believe the relatively low price of our software modules provides an opportunity for repeat sales 
we currently have over various software modules available that replicate such medical procedures as intravenous catheterization  peripherally inserted central catheters picc  bronchoscopy  colonoscopy  cardiac pacing  carotid and coronary angioplasty  and hysteroscopy 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were from medtronic 
sales and distribution sales of these products may experience seasonal fluctuations related to teaching hospitals summer residency programs 
in addition  there may be variations in timing of revenue recognition from the sale of systems with upgrade rights and from development contracts 
the latter may depend on numerous factors including contract milestones and timing of work performed against the contract 
most raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are readily available commercial components 
there are no unusual working capital requirements in the medical segment 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for revenue information for the past three years 
with respect to medical simulation products  we employ a direct sales force in the us that markets simulation systems to hospitals  colleges and universities  nursing schools  medical schools  emergency medical technician training programs  the military  medical device companies  and other organizations involved in procedural medicine 
we have eight regional medical sales representatives in the united states 
we also have one independent sales representative in europe and resellers outside the us for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were medical revenues 
competition there are several companies that currently sell simulation products to medical customers 
some simulators target the same minimally invasive procedures as do ours  while others sell mannequin based systems for emergency response training 
all simulators compete at some level for the same funding in medical institutions 
competitors include simbionix usa corporation  mentice corporation  laerdal medical as  medical education technologies  inc  and medical simulation corporation 
the principal competitive factors are the type of medical procedure being simulated  technological sophistication  and price 
we believe we compete favorably on all three 
research and development our success depends on our ability to invent  improve  and reduce the costs of our technologies in a timely manner  produce our products cost effectively  and interact with our licensees who are integrating our technologies and licensed software into theirs 
immersion engineering 
we have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and scientists who possess experience in the disciplines required for touch enabling technology development  including mechanical engineering  electrical engineering  firmware  control system  computer science  and haptic content design 
for medical simulations  we have assembled a unique team of experts who are skilled at modeling the anatomy and physiology of various medical cases  creating graphical renderings  designing haptic feedback  and devising advanced control algorithms to simulate realistic navigation for medical procedures  such as through the body s blood vessels 

table of contents licensee interaction 
in order to increase the successful design and adoption of our technology or software products in a licensee s product  we make efforts to ensure clear communication between us and our customers 
typically  collaborative development efforts are structured using a four phase approach including product definition  concept development  detail design  and production design phases 
at the conclusion of each phase  a review meeting is held with team members from both companies to examine what was discovered and the conclusions that were reached during that portion of the project 
these reviews provide an excellent opportunity to reassess the project direction and product viability prior to entering subsequent phases 
the continuation of our development effort is contingent upon successful completion of prior phases 
this method ensures that the customer s financial risk is minimized and that project deliverables remain consistent with the goals established in the product definition phase 
the four phase design process is typically used for designing new systems when the solution is not known beforehand 
for software product solutions  the integration of our products for example  firmware for mobile phones requires a straightforward approach  providing integration kits that include comprehensive documentation  libraries  and source code 
we work with the customer to guarantee conformance to a standard and to ensure that third party developers can expect a consistent set of haptically enabled devices in the field 
our research and development efforts have been focused on technology development  including hardware  software  control algorithms  and design 
we have entered into numerous contracts with corporations and government agencies that help fund advanced research and development 
our government contracts permit us to retain ownership of the technology developed under the contracts  provided that we supply the applicable government agency a license to use the technology for noncommercial purposes 
for the years ended december    and  our research and development expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
intellectual property we believe that intellectual property protection is crucial to our business 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  nondisclosure agreements with employees and third parties  licensing arrangements  and other contractual agreements with third parties to protect our intellectual property 
we and our wholly owned subsidiaries hold more than issued or pending patents in the us and other countries covering various aspects of our hardware and software technologies 
some of our current us patents begin to expire starting in where we feel it is appropriate  we will engage the legal system to protect our intellectual property rights 
for example  we filed a complaint against sony computer entertainment  inc and sony computer entertainment of america  inc collectively sony computer entertainment on february  in the us district court for the northern district court of california 
on september   a jury returned a verdict favorable to us in our patent infringement suit against sony computer entertainment 
judgment was entered in our favor and we were awarded million in past damages  and pre judgment interest in the amount of million  for a total of million 
additionally  the court issued a permanent injunction stayed pending appeal against the manufacture  use  sale  or import into the united states of the infringing sony playstation system 
sony computer entertainment has appealed the judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation

on may   sony computer entertainment filed a similar request for reexamination of the patent 
on july   we filed a petition to dismiss  stay or alternatively to suspend both of the requests for reexamination  based at least on the grounds that a final judgment has already been entered by a united states district court  and that the pto s current inter partes reexamination procedures deny due process of law 
the pto denied the first petition  and we filed a second petition on september  on november   the pto granted our petition  and suspended the inter partes reexaminations until such time as the parallel court proceedings warrant termination or resumption of the pto examination and prosecution proceedings 
on december   sony computer entertainment filed a third petition requesting permission to file an additional inter partes reexamination on the claims of the and patents for which reexamination was not requested in sony computer entertainment s original requests for reexamination  we have opposed this petition

the appeals of the january and february orders regarding the compulsory license have been consolidated with this appeal of the judgment 
sony computer entertainment s opening brief was filed on october   we filed an opposition brief on december  due to the cross appeal by internet services llc isllc see below  the federal circuit allowed us to file a substitute opposition brief on february  responding to the briefs filed by both sony computer entertainment and isllc 
we expect the briefing for the appeal to be concluded by all parties by the end of march on july   sony computer entertainment filed a motion in the district court before judge wilken seeking relief from the final judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on the grounds of alleged fraud and newly discovered evidence of purported prior art which sony computer entertainment contends we concealed and withheld attributable to mr 
craig thorner  a named inventor on three patents that sony computer entertainment urged as a basis for patent invalidity during the trial 
we dispute and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations 
briefing is complete  and a hearing was held before judge wilken on 
table of contents january  on march   the court denied sony computer entertainment s motion pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in its entirety 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict how the court of appeals will decide the appeal 
we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
we expense litigation costs as incurred and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
the litigation has diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved  the litigation could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
in the event we settle our lawsuit with sony computer entertainment  we will be obligated to pay certain sums to microsoft as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if sony computer entertainment ultimately were successful on appeal or in the reexamination process  the judgment may be put at risk  assets relating to the patents in the lawsuit may be impaired  and sony computer entertainment may seek additional relief  such as attorneys fees 
internet services llc litigation on october   isllc  a company licensee and cross claim defendant against whom sony computer entertainment had filed a claim seeking declaratory relief  filed claims against us alleging that we breached a contract with isllc by suing sony computer entertainment for patent infringement relating to haptically enabled software whose topics or images are allegedly age restricted  for judicial apportionment of damages awarded by the jury between isllc and us  and for a judicial declaration with respect to isllc s rights and duties under agreements with us 
on december   the court issued an order dismissing isllc s claims against sony computer entertainment with prejudice and dismissing isllc s claims against us without prejudice to isllc filing a new complaint if it can do so in good faith without contradicting  or repeating the deficiency of  its complaint 
on january   isllc filed amended cross claims and counterclaims against us that contained similar claims

isllc s complaint seeks a share of our judgment and recovery against sony computer entertainment and of the microsoft settlement proceeds  and generally restates the claims already adjudicated in district court 
our response to the complaint is due on march  litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  has been in the past  and could result in the future  in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property 
table of contents rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming  and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technologies  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we and our licensees could be enjoined from the continued use of the technologies at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed  and we could not develop non infringing technologies or license the infringed or similar technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses would increase and our revenues could decrease 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees have received similar letters from these or other companies 
such letters or subsequent litigation may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  such letters may cause a dispute between our licensees and us over indemnification for the infringement claim 
any of these notices  or additional notices that we or our licensees could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation against us  either regarding the infringement claim or the indemnification claim 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technologies and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against our licensees  or us  whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technologies unless we can enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims by third parties against our licensees could also result in claims by our licensees against us under the indemnification provisions of our licensees agreements with us 
the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and we expect to continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights under our technology and intellectual property 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
we refer to the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including  but not limited to  field of use definitions  market sector  and product category definitions  collectively as license provisions 
due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories  and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different from our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to a claims that we have granted rights to one licensee which are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee  and or b claims by one licensee against another licensee that may result in our incurring indemnification or other obligations or liabilities 

table of contents in addition  after we enter into an agreement  it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that we did not foresee or was not foreseeable at the time we entered into the agreement 
as a result  in the agreement  we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of potentially lucrative new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
our products or our licensees products may have flaws or other defects that may lead to personal or other injury claims 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  financial loss  or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
any claims against us would be time consuming  expensive to defend  and distracting to management  and could result in damages and injure our reputation and or the reputation of our products  or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels  or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
if the settlement on our current class action lawsuit falls through  the continuing lawsuit could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming to defend against  and if we are not successful  could adversely affect our business

the operative amended complaint is brought on purported behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from the date of our ipo through december  it alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of on the grounds that the registration statement for the ipo did not disclose that the underwriters agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the ipo in exchange for excess commissions to be paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the complaint also appears to allege that false or misleading analyst reports were issued 
the complaint does not claim any specific amount of damages 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the motion was denied as to claims under the securities act of in the case involving us  as well as in all other cases except for cases 
the motion was denied as to the claim under section b as to us  on the basis that the complaint alleged that we had made acquisition s following the ipo 
the motion was granted as to the claim under section b  but denied as to the claim under section a  as to the remaining individual defendant 
we and most of the issuer defendants have settled with the plaintiffs 
in this settlement  plaintiffs have dismissed and released all claims against the immersion defendants  in exchange for a contingent payment by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all of the ipo cases  and for the assignment or surrender of certain claims we may have against the underwriters 
the immersion defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we believe is remote 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement 

table of contents if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage  or terrorist activity 
california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
any such loss at our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments  and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
industry and technology risks we have little or no control or influence on our licensees design  manufacturing  promotion  distribution  or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
however  we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technologies in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  achieve commercial acceptance  or generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
products incorporating our touch enabling technologies are generally more difficult to design and manufacture  which may cause product introduction delays or quality control problems 
if our licensees fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for products that generate royalties for us  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
alternatively  if a product that incorporates our touch enabling technologies achieves widespread market acceptance  the product manufacturer may elect to stop making it rather than pay us royalties based on sales of the product 
peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the video console gaming and computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty and license revenue 
most of our current gaming royalty revenues come from third party peripheral makers who make licensed gaming products designed for use with popular video game console systems from microsoft  sony  and nintendo 
video game console systems are closed  proprietary systems  and video game console system makers typically impose certain requirements or restrictions on third party peripheral makers who wish to make peripherals that will be compatible with a particular video game console system 
these requirements and restrictions could be in the form of hardware technical specifications  software technical specifications  security specifications  component vendor specifications  licensing terms and conditions  or other forms 
if third party peripheral makers can not or are not allowed to obtain or satisfy these requirements or restrictions  our gaming royalty revenues could be significantly reduced 
furthermore  should a significant video game console maker choose to omit touch enabling capabilities from its console system  it may very well lead our gaming licensees to stop making products with touch enabling capabilities  thereby significantly reducing our gaming royalty revenues 
the recently launched microsoft xbox ships with touch enabling capabilities built in  and the upcoming next generation nintendo revolution 
table of contents has been reported by nintendo to have touch enabling capabilities 
however  no announcements have been made regarding the touch enabling capabilities of the upcoming next generation sony console system 
microsoft launched its next generation xbox video game console in november  and it is anticipated that sony and nintendo will launch their new next generation video game console systems in historically  according to data from the npd group  sales of console peripherals by third party suppliers grow to about or more of total market share near the end of the life cycle of a console system 
when next generation console systems are released third party peripheral product sales initially account for or less of total market share 
this percentage increases as the console model ages 
most of our current gaming royalty revenue is from third party peripheral makers 
consequently  with the new console introductions already beginning and continuing to take place over the year  our gaming royalty revenue will likely decrease from current levels  which may hurt our business 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets might decline if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled gaming products and consumer products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services  excluding specified products  covered by our patents 
we also granted to microsoft a limited right  under our patents relating to touch technologies  to sublicense specified rights  excluding rights to excluded products and peripheral devices  to third party customers of microsoft s or microsoft s subsidiaries products other than sony corporation  sony computer entertainment inc  sony computer entertainment of america inc  and their subsidiaries 
in exchange  for the grant of these rights and the rights included in a separate sublicense agreement  microsoft paid us a one time payment of million 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled console gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as mobile phones and pdas 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments might decline 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not licensed the rights to produce wireless controllers to any third party peripheral makers 
wireless game controllers account for a significant and growing portion of our royalty revenue  including revenue from logitech and mad catz 
therefore  by retaining the market for wireless xbox game controllers exclusively for itself  microsoft will likely significantly increase its market share of all aftermarket game controller sales  the effect of which is likely to reduce our gaming royalty revenue 
logitech accounts for a significant portion of our revenue and the failure of logitech to achieve sales volumes for its gaming peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies may reduce our total revenue 
logitech accounts for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from logitech 
we expect that logitech will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
if logitech s sales volumes for its computer and console gaming peripheral products that incorporate our technologies decline  our total revenue may decline 
medtronic accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and a reduction in sales to medtronic  or a reduction in development work for medtronic  may reduce our total revenue 
medtronic accounts for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from medtronic 
if our product sales to medtronic decline  and or medtronic reduces the development activities we perform  then our total revenue may decline 

table of contents automotive royalties will be reduced if bmw were to abandon its idrive system or remove our technology from the idrive 
our largest royalty stream from the automotive industry is currently from bmw for its idrive controller 
press reviews of this system have been largely negative and critical of the system s complex user interface  which we did not design 
nevertheless  this negative press may cause bmw to abandon the idrive controller or to redesign it and or remove our technology from it 
the design cycle time for major automotive systems like idrive is typically two to five years 
one or more of the current bmw product lines may go through replacement or redesign and during that cycle the idrive controller may be replaced or removed 
historically  bmw has often launched its newest technology in its series 
we also believe that the current series is due for redesign by and that our technology may  or may not  be part of the redesigned idrive 
a decline in our royalties from bmw will harm our business 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our revenue and or results of operations could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly 
our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products for a wide variety of systems  products  and services  and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components  products  and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules 
we may experience a shortage of  or a delay in receiving  certain supplies as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints  supplier financial weaknesses  disputes with suppliers  other problems experienced by suppliers  or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these supplies may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues  or the supplies may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed 
we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs  or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings  resulting in further costs and delays 
additionally  our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues 
we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology  availability  price  quality  or other considerations 
in addition  new products that we introduce may use custom components obtained from only one source initially  until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers 
the performance of such single source suppliers may affect the quality  quantity  and price of supplies to us 
accordingly  our revenue and or results of operations could be adversely impacted by such events 
because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently must work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technologies for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies are currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows me  and windows xp operating systems  including directx  microsoft s entertainment applications programming interface 
modifications and new versions of microsoft s operating system including directx and the upcoming windows vista anticipated to launch in late may require that we and or our licensees modify the touch enabling technologies to be compatible with microsoft s modifications or new versions  and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline 
reduced spending by corporate or university research and development departments may adversely affect sales of our three dimensional and professional products 
any economic downturn could lead to a reduction in corporations or university budgets for research and development in sectors  including the automotive and aerospace sectors  which use our three dimensional and professional products 
sales of our three dimensional and professional products  including our cyberglove line of 
table of contents whole hand sensing gloves and our microscribe line of digitizers  could be adversely affected by cuts in corporate research and development budgets 
competition between our products and our licensees products may reduce our revenue 
rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns  declining average selling prices  and increasing foreign and domestic competition characterize the markets in which we and our licensees compete 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
we face competition from unlicensed products as well 
our licensees or other third parties may seek to develop products using our intellectual property or develop alternative designs that attempt to circumvent our intellectual property  which they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 
we have experienced significant change in our business  and our failure to manage the complexities associated with the changing economic environment and technology landscape could harm our business 
any future periods of rapid economic and technological change may place significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering  and other resources 
in particular  because our technologies are complex  if the economy weakens  an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating  and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our licensees may be required 
the market for certain touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for certain of our touch enabling technologies and certain of our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions  or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees  component customers  and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
negative product reviews or publicity about our products  our licensees products  haptic features  or haptic technology in general could have a negative impact on market adoption  our revenue  and or our ability to license our technologies in the future 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees  and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technologies  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new or renewal of licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding  and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  
table of contents the fact that we may compete with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies in new applications like mobile phones and touchscreens  difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs and risks necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  difficulties in signing up new automotive licensees for not yet commercialized technology when their components suppliers may not yet be able to meet the car companies stringent quality and parts availability standards  difficulty in signing up new gaming licensees  as well as losing our existing gaming licensees  if we are not successful in the litigation with sony computer entertainment  and reluctance of content developers  mobile phone manufacturers  and service providers to sign license agreements without a critical mass of other such inter dependent supporters of the mobile phone industry having a license or without enough phones in the market that incorporate our technologies 
a majority of our current royalty revenue has been derived from the licensing of our portfolio of touch enabling technologies for video game console and personal computer gaming peripherals  such as gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels 
though substantially smaller than the market for dedicated gaming console peripherals  the market for gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels for use with personal computers is declining and is characterized by declining average selling prices 
if the console peripheral market also experiences declines in sales and selling prices  we may not achieve royalty revenue growth 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
we rely on our significant patent portfolio to protect our proprietary rights 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court or the patent office were to limit the scope  declare unenforceable  or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments or they may choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements  other contractual agreements  and copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our products  trademarks  and other proprietary rights would be difficult  expensive  and time consuming  particularly overseas 
certain terms or rights granted in our license agreements or our development contracts may limit our future revenue opportunities 
while it is not our general practice to sign license agreements that provide exclusive rights for a period of time with respect to a technology  field of use  and or geography  or to accept similar limitations in product development contracts  we have entered into such agreements and may in the future 
although additional compensation or other 
table of contents benefits may be part of the agreement  the compensation or benefits may not adequately compensate us for the limitations or restrictions we have agreed to as that particular market develops 
over the life of the exclusivity period  especially in markets that grow larger or faster than anticipated  our revenue may be limited and less than what we could have achieved in the market with several licensees or additional products available to sell to a specific set of customers 
if we are unable to continually improve and reduce the cost of our technologies  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products  which could impair our revenue growth 
our ability to achieve revenue growth depends on our continuing ability to improve and reduce the cost of our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete  and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technologies could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial  and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies or products  the technologies we develop infringe on third party patents  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete 
compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union may increase our costs and limit our revenue opportunities 
the rohs directive eliminates most uses of lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  mercury  and certain fire retardants in electronics placed on the market after july  we have not yet quantified the potential full effect of this new directive on our products  but the directive will require changes to some of our products that may be costly and this may have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we are currently in discussions with our suppliers and working with them so that we can be in compliance as of the effective date of the rohs directive 
if we are unable to  or decide not to make our products compliant by the effective date  we will not be able to ship them in the european union and or any other region that adopts the directive until such time that they are compliant  and this may limit our revenue opportunities 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent their widespread adoption 
personal computer and console gaming peripherals  mobile phones  touchscreens  and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies can be more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as alps electric co  ltd  bmw  logitech  microsoft  and samsung have licensed our technologies  the greater expense of development and production of products containing our touch enabling technologies as compared to non touch enabled products may be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption and sale of touch enabled products 

table of contents if we fail to increase sales of our medical simulation devices  our financial condition and operations may suffer 
our medical simulation products  such as our endovascular accutouch system and our laparascopic surgical workstation  have only recently begun to be used by hospitals and medical schools to help train healthcare professionals 
as a result  many of these medical institutions do not budget for such simulation devices 
to increase sales of our simulation devices  we must  in addition to convincing medical institution personnel of the usefulness of the devices  persuade them to include a significant expenditure for the devices in their budgets 
if these medical institutions are unwilling to budget for simulation devices or reduce their budgets as a result of cost containment pressures or other factors  we may not be able to increase or maintain sales of medical simulators at a satisfactory rate 
any failure to increase sales of our medical simulation products will harm our business 
third party validation studies may not demonstrate all the benefits of our medical training simulators  which could affect customer motivation to buy 
in medical training  validation studies are generally used to confirm the usefulness of new techniques  devices  and training methods 
for medical training simulators  several levels of validation are generally tested content  concurrent  construct  and predictive 
a validation study performed by a third party  such as a hospital  a teaching institution  or even an individual healthcare professional  could result in showing little or no benefit for one or more types of validation for our medical training simulators 
such validation study results published in medical journals could impact the willingness of customers to buy our training simulators  especially new simulators that have not previously been validated 
due to the time generally required to complete and publish additional validation studies often more than a year  the negative impact on sales revenue could be significant 
medical licensing and certification authorities may not recommend or require use of our technologies for training and or testing purposes  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine  or abim and the american college of cardiology  or acc  have great influence in recommending particular medical methodologies  including medical training and testing methodologies  for use by medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse medical simulation products as a training and or testing tool  market penetration for our products could be significantly and adversely affected 
we have limited distribution channels and resources to market and sell our medical simulation and three dimensional simulation and digitizing products  and if we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling these products  we may not achieve or sustain product revenue growth 
we have limited resources for marketing and selling medical simulation or three dimensional simulation and digitizing products either directly or through distributors 
to achieve our business objectives  we must build a balanced mixture of sales through a direct sales channel and through qualified distribution channels 
the success of our efforts to sell medical simulation and three dimensional simulation products will depend upon our ability to retain and develop a qualified sales force and effective distributor channels 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to sell and market our simulation products 
a number of our distributors represent small  specialized companies and may not have sufficient capital or human resources to support the complexities of selling and supporting simulation products 
there can be no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  distributors will market our products successfully or  if our relationships with distributors terminate  that we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in the distribution  sales  or marketing network for our simulation products could have a material adverse effect on our product revenues 

table of contents competition in the medical market may reduce our revenue 
if the medical simulation market develops as we anticipate  we believe that we will have a greater number of competitors 
this increased competition may result in the decline of our revenue and may cause us to reduce our selling prices 
competition in the mobility or touchscreen markets may increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
if the mobility or touchscreen markets develop as we anticipate  we believe that we will face a greater number of competitors 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial and technical resources than we do  and the costs associated with competing with such potential competitors could be significant 
additionally  increased competition may result in the reduction of our market share and or cause us to reduce our prices  which may result in a decline in our revenue 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive per unit automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we do not earn per unit royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless and until automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer or a supplier to an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the per unit automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle or the option packages if our technology is an option for example  a navigation unit  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 
we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate  and retain sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of if  how  and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices considerably above the current market price of our common stock 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technologies  and develop new technologies 
investment risks our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  the timing of work performed under development agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  stock based awards  acquisitions of technologies  or businesses  the timing of introductions and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees  our competitors  or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  our ability to attract  integrate  and retain qualified personnel  and seasonality in the demand for our products or our licensees products 
our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of our common stock by insiders or others  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company  such as the suit currently filed against us 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares 
issuance of the shares of common stock upon conversion of debentures  exercise of stock options  and exercise of warrants will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of common stock in the following circumstances will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders i upon conversion of some or all of the convertible debentures ii upon exercise of some or all of the stock options  and iii upon exercise of some or all of the warrants 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or upon such exercises  respectively  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of these convertible debentures  stock options  and warrants may encourage short selling by market participants 
our major stockholders retain significant control over us  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance matters and could also affect the volatility of our stock price 
we currently have  have had in the past  and may have in the future  stockholders who retain greater than  or in some cases greater than  of our outstanding stock 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to exercise significant influence over matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and 
table of contents mergers or other business combinations  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us 
further  if any individuals in this group elect to sell a significant portion or all of their holdings of our common stock  the trading price of our common stock could experience volatility 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  which may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to ensure a sufficient supply of cash for continued operations and litigation costs 
we have taken measures to control our costs and will continue to monitor these efforts 
in addition  sony computer entertainment has made payments to us pursuant to the court s orders 
although we have received the payments  we may be required to return them and any future payments based on the outcome of an appeals process 
our plans to raise additional capital may include possible customer prepayments of certain royalty obligations in exchange for a royalty discount and or other negotiated concessions  entering into new license agreements that require up front license payments  and through debt or equity financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
changes in equity markets over the past five years have adversely affected the ability of companies to raise equity financing and have adversely affected the markets for financing for companies with a history of losses such as ours 
additional financing may require us to take on more debt or issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock such that our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention  or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future  acquire businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities  or increase our intellectual property portfolio 
if we consummate acquisitions through cash and or an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  and potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if we fail to comply with nasdaq s maintenance criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock could be delisted 
to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  we are required to comply with one of two sets of maintenance criteria for continued listing 
under the first set of criteria  among other things  we must maintain stockholders equity of at least million  the market value of our publicly held common stock excluding shares held by our affiliates must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
under the second set of criteria  among other things  the market value of our common stock must be at least million or we must have both million in assets and million in revenues  the market value of our publicly held shares must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
as of december   our most recent balance sheet date  we had a deficit in stockholders equity  and therefore would not have been in compliance with the first set of listing criteria as of that date 
although we were in compliance with the second set of criteria  should the price of our common stock decline to the point where the aggregate value of our outstanding common stock falls below million  the value of our publicly held shares falls below million  or the bid price of our common stock falls below per share  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to 
table of contents comply with the applicable criteria and our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  it would likely be more difficult to affect trades and to determine the market price of our common stock 
in addition  delisting of our common stock could materially affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our future ability to raise necessary capital 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as standards are modified  supplemented  or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost  and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or additional regulatory rulings that will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
these changes and other legal changes  as well as proposed legislative initiatives following the enron bankruptcy  are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
in addition  insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of high claims rates over the past year  which we expect will increase our premiums for our various insurance policies 
further  the financial accounting standards board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r which requires us  as of january   to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense of our employee stock options 
sfas no 
r may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial conditions and may impact the way we conduct our business 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results

sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  no 
mc sdny the named defendants are immersion and three of our current or former officers or directors the immersion defendants  and certain underwriters of our november  initial public offering ipo 
subsequently  two of the individual defendants stipulated to a dismissal without prejudice 
the operative amended complaint is brought on purported behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from the date of our ipo through december  it alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the ipo did not disclose that the underwriters agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the ipo in exchange for excess commissions to be paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the complaint also appears to allege that false or misleading analyst reports were issued 
the complaint does not claim any specific amount of damages 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the motion was denied as to claims under the securities act of in the case involving us as well as in all other cases except for cases 
the motion was denied as to the claim under section b as to us  on the basis that the complaint alleged that we had made acquisition s following the ipo 
the motion was granted as to the claim under section b  but denied as to the claim under section a  as to the remaining individual defendant 
we and most of the issuer defendants have settled with the plaintiffs 
in this settlement  plaintiffs have dismissed and released all claims against the immersion defendants  in exchange for a contingent payment by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all of the ipo cases  and for the assignment or surrender of certain claims we may have against the underwriters 
the immersion defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we believe is remote 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  may  will  and other similar expressions 
however  these words are not the only way we identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements  which refer to expectations  projections  or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in item a  risk factors  those described elsewhere in this report  and those described in our other reports filed with the sec 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements which could occur after the filing of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  inventories  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable accounting standards including staff accounting bulletin sab no

 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
royalty and license revenue we recognize royalty and license revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee as well as time based licenses of our intellectual property portfolio 
up front payments under license agreements are deferred and recognized as revenue based on either the royalty reports received or amortized over the license period depending on the nature of the agreement 
advance payments under license agreements that also require us to provide future services to the licensee are deferred and recognized over the service period when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe related to the value of the services does not exist 
we generally recognize revenue from our licensees under one or a combination of the following license models license revenue model revenue recognition perpetual license of intellectual property portfolio based on per unit royalties  no services contracted

see also comments regarding multiple element arrangements below 
if the information received from our licensees regarding royalties is incorrect or inaccurate  our revenues in future periods may be adversely affected 
to date  none of the information we have received from our licensees has caused any material reduction in future period revenues 
product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when the product is shipped  provided collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligation remains 
we sell the majority of our products with warranties ranging from three to twenty four months 
we record the estimated warranty costs during the quarter the revenue is recognized 
historically  warranty related costs and related accruals have not been significant 
we offer a general right of return on the microscribe product line for days after purchase 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of a 
table of contents microscribe system and provide an accrual for potential returns based on historical experience 
no other general right of return is offered on our products 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue is comprised of professional services consulting services and or development contracts  customer support  and extended warranty contracts 
development contract revenues are recognized under the cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
customer support and extended warranty contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into revenue arrangements in which the customer purchases a combination of patent  technology  and or software licenses  products  professional services  support  and extended warranties multiple element arrangements 
when vsoe of fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
the price charged when the element is sold separately generally determines the fair value or vsoe 
for arrangements where vsoe of fair value exists only for the undelivered elements  we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in greater or future operating losses 
long term liabilities in we executed a series of agreements with microsoft as described in note to the consolidated financial statements that provided for settlement of our lawsuit against microsoft as well as various licensing  sublicensing  and equity and financing arrangements 
we accounted for the proceeds received under the agreements as a long term customer advance based on certain provisions that would result in payment of funds to microsoft 
upon microsoft s election to convert its shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock into common stock in april  we reduced the long term customer advance from microsoft to the minimum amount we would be obligated to pay microsoft upon a settlement with sony computer entertainment 
the remainder of the consideration was transferred to common stock 
in december  we executed a series of agreements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements that provided for the issuance of senior subordinated convertible debenture convertible debenture  and warrants  and that granted certain registration rights to the holders of the convertible debentures registration rights 
we accounted for the issuance of our convertible debentures and related warrants in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and other related accounting guidance 
we estimated the relative fair value of the various instruments included in the agreements entered into in december and allocated the relative fair values to be as follows warrants million  put option million  registration rights million  issuance costs million  convertible debenture million 
the convertible debentures are being accreted to million over their five year life  resulting in additional interest expense 
the value of the warrants is included in stockholders deficit  the value of the put option and registration rights are recorded as liabilities and are subject to future value adjustments  and the value of the convertible debentures is recorded as long term debt 

table of contents recovery of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
to date such estimated losses have been within our expectations 
inventory reserves we reduce our inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product return and warranty reserves we provide for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns and warranty obligations based on historical experience when related revenues are recognized  and we defer warranty related revenue over the related warranty term 
intangible assets we have acquired patents and other intangibles 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal and filing fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets  and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they issue  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during  we capitalized external costs associated with patents and trademarks of million 
our total amortization expense for the same period for all intangible assets was million 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations overview of during  we achieved several significant milestones including growth in several of our key market areas 
this growth was due  in part  to our continued investment in a strengthened and more focused sales and marketing effort across our business segments during in addition  as market acceptance of medical simulation has increased  our medical product sales grew in on a year over year basis and accounted for of total immersion medical revenue for the year 
this growth is also a result of the ongoing transformation of our business model into one emphasizing product development that leads to increased product sales 
in we introduced significant new software modules for our endovascular training simulator 
in  an additional handset licensee was signed  sky teletech 
in addition  the first samsung mobile phones with our vibetonz technology launched  and by the end of the year  four vibetonz enabled models were being offered by six wireless operators worldwide that serve a total of approximately million subscribers

on march   the us district court for the northern district of california entered judgment in our favor and awarded us a total of million in damages and interest with regard to our litigation with sony computer entertainment 
the court issued  and subsequently stayed pending appeal  a permanent injunction against the manufacture  use  sale  or import into the united states of the infringing sony playstation system consisting of the playstation consoles  dual shock controllers  and the games found by the jury to infringe our patents 
the court further ordered sony computer entertainment to pay a compulsory license fee for the duration of the stay of the permanent injunction  pursuant to which sony computer entertainment has made quarterly payments to us 
sony computer entertainment has appealed the judgment  including the million award  the injunction  and the compulsory license  to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in  we expect to continue to focus on the execution of sales and marketing plans in our established businesses to increase revenue and make selected investments in product and technology development for longer term new growth areas 
we have taken measures to control our operating expenses including a reduction in force of approximately in early we expect litigation expenses to decrease in as compared to we have budgeted to continue to protect and defend our extensive intellectual property portfolio across all business segments 
our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of our new products or our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors  and the cost of ongoing litigation

our total revenue for the year ended december  increased by  or to million from million in royalty and license revenue 
royalty and license revenue is comprised of royalties earned on sales by our licensees and license fees charged for our intellectual property portfolio 
royalty and license revenue increased by  or from to the increase in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of an increase in gaming royalties of  and an increase in automotive royalties and licensee revenue of  offset by a decrease in medical royalty and license revenue of million 
the increase in gaming royalties was mainly due to increased third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers  increased growth in the game console controller market  and royalties from new licensees signed in late and early in the console peripheral business  many of our third party licensees from whom we earn per unit royalties enjoyed the benefits of strong sales of premium products and significant market share growth in at the expense of first party peripheral 
table of contents makers ie  sony  microsoft  and nintendo 
third party peripheral makers market share tends to increase as consoles near end of life 
microsoft s xbox next generation video console system was introduced in november  and additional next generation consoles are expected to be introduced in late by sony and nintendo 
accordingly  we anticipate that third party royalties will likely decline as these new consoles are introduced and market share shifts back to first party peripheral makers 
for the xbox next generation video console system  microsoft has  to date  not licensed the rights to produce wireless controllers to any third party peripheral makers 
wireless game controllers account for a significant and growing portion of all game controller sales 
therefore  by retaining the market for wireless xbox game controllers exclusively for itself  microsoft will likely significantly increase its market share of all aftermarket game controller sales  the effect of which is likely to reduce our gaming royalty revenue 
furthermore  according to npd funworld  in the first two months of launch of the xbox  microsoft had over a market share of wired xbox game controllers  leaving third parties with less than a market share 
while we expect third party market share of wired xbox game controllers to increase in from its current level  the dominant market position by microsoft in wired xbox game controllers will reduce our gaming royalty revenue compared to in the pc gaming peripheral business  the overall industry again declined  but this decline was more than offset by the aforementioned gains in the console peripheral business 
automotive royalties increased in due to increased licensee revenue from signing a new licensee in and royalties from an increased number of vehicles manufactured with our technology incorporated in them 
we expect increased automotive royalties and license revenue in based on new licensees signed and additional launches of cars sold incorporating our technology 
the decrease in medical royalty and license revenue in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue from our license and development agreements with medtronic 
revenue recognition on the license and development agreements with medtronic is based on cost to cost percentage of completion  a decrease in activity on these contracts results in a decrease in revenue recognized 
product sales 
product sales increased by million or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased medical product sales of million  in particular  increased sales of our vascular access  endovascular  and laparoscopic simulator platforms 
this increase was a result of focusing sales force resources on selling training simulator products to hospitals and teaching institutions as well as targeted marketing programs and improved reseller performance 
additionally  as the market acceptance of medical simulation has increased  we have transformed our business model for immersion medical into one that emphasizes product development and product sales as opposed to development contracts 
offsetting this was a decrease of  in product sales mainly from our d and professional products  and microprocessors 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of our d products such as our cyberglove and cybertouch tm devices caused by the delay in upgrades to this product line and increased competition  decreased sales of our force feedback electronics for arcade gaming due to the timing of product introductions by our customers  and reduced sales of microprocessors based on a decision to eliminate the sales effort related to this lower margin product line 
development contracts and other revenue 
development contracts and other revenue decreased by  or from to development contracts and other revenue is comprised of revenue on commercial and government contracts 
the decrease in this category was primarily due to decreases in both medical government and commercial development contract revenues  but was partially offset by an increase in development contracts in the industrial market 
the decrease in medical development contract revenue was due to a decrease in revenue recognized on our license and development agreements with medtronic and the continued transition of our medical engineering resources from government grants and certain commercial development contract efforts to product development efforts that focus on leveraging our existing sales and channel distribution capabilities

the cost of product sales increased by  or from to this increase was mainly due to increased product sales of and the corresponding increased direct materials  freight costs to customers  and royalties  as well as increased inventory write offs  offset in part by decreased overhead and decreased price and cost variances 
increased volume related expense such as increased direct materials  increased freight costs  and increased royalties accounted for  of the increase in cost of product sales from to of the aforementioned amount  direct materials only increased by  due to favorable product mix shifts resulting from increased sales of higher margin products such as our vascular access training simulators and reduced sales of our lower margin microprocessors 
additionally during  we experienced increased physical inventory write offs  scrap charges  and increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of  due to some product and process transitions during the period 
these increases were offset in part by reduced overhead costs and reduced price and cost variances of  cost of product sales as percentage of revenue declined to in as compared to in due to the aforementioned favorable product mix shifts

accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no

r will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal we expect that the new standard will result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share  as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas no

although such pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important aspects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition

the compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption  is recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption is based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our foreign operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had outstanding million of fixed rate long term convertible debentures 
the holder of a convertible debenture has the right to convert the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest in whole or in part into our common shares at a price of per common share  the conversion price 
in the event of a change of control  a holder may require us to redeem all or a portion of their convertible debenture

we have equity investments in several privately held companies 
we intend to hold our equity investments for the long term and will monitor whether there has been other than temporary declines in their values based on management s estimates of their net realizable value taking into account the companies respective financial condition and ability to raise third party financing 
if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recorded and the individual security is written down to a new cost basis 
as a result of our review of the fair value of these investments  we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of the remaining cost basis of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet is zero 
as of december   management determined that the carrying value of these investments at zero is appropriate
