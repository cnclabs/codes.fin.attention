the future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets were below their respective carrying amounts 
as a result  an impairment loss was measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and fair value  which was based on current estimates of market price 
the fourth quarter provision for income taxes was a charge of  primarily due to a charge resulting from a net change in the total valuation allowance for of  during the year end financial accounting closing process  we determined that the timing of when we will generate sufficient us taxable income to realize our us deferred tax assets became less certain  therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance  primarily against our net federal deferred tax assets in the us  of  we recorded similar valuation allowances in certain other jurisdictions in the fourth quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
unless otherwise noted  all dollars are presented in thousands general we have six major product categories graphite electrodes  cathodes  carbon electrodes  carbon refractories  advanced graphite materials and natural graphite  the results of which are reported in the following segments synthetic graphite  which primarily serves the steel  aluminum  transportation and semiconductor industries and includes graphite electrodes  cathodes and advanced graphite materials and related services 
we have a strategic alliance in the cathode business with alcan pechiney  one of the world s largest aluminum producers  which is a owner of our cathode subsidiary  carbone savoie 
other  which includes carbon electrodes  refractories and natural graphite 
our natural graphite activities  which are conducted by aet  primarily serve the electronics  automotive  petrochemical and power generation industries and include advanced flexible graphite and flexible graphite solutions and related services 
we have a strategic alliance in the natural graphite business with ballard power systems  the world s recognized leader in pem fuel cells 
ballard power systems became a strategic investor in aet in june  by investing million in shares of ballard power systems common stock for a equity ownership interest in aet 
our other carbon product activities serve the silicon metal  steel and ferro alloy industries 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
over the three years prior to the first half  we faced extremely challenging business and industry conditions 
adverse global and regional economic conditions negatively impacted many of the end markets for our products 
many of the customers in these markets reduced production levels  became less creditworthy  filed for bankruptcy protection or were acquired as part of consolidation trends within their industries 
in addition  for most of this period  industry wide capacity for most of our products exceeded demand 
such factors reduced demand and prices for products sold by us 
global and certain regional economic conditions began to strengthen in the second half 
steel production increased globally and was particularly strong in china 
we estimate that worldwide steel production was about million metric tons in we estimate that eaf steel production increased to about million metric tons in we believe that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate was about in and in we operated our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at very high levels in the strengthening in the steel industry in and the tightening of the graphite electrode supply demand balance lead to an increase in average graphite electrode prices in as compared to demand for cathodes in excluding china decreased from because of reduced construction of new aluminum smelters 
we operated our cathode manufacturing capacity at relatively high operating levels in demand for carbon refractories was strong in as a result of our increased penetration of various markets  including europe and china  and increased blast furnace construction and refurbishment 
weak economic conditions resulted in relatively low demand and weak pricing in for most of our other products 
global and regional economic conditions continued to strengthen throughout and steel demand and production remained strong 
we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about higher than in we estimate that electric arc furnace steel production increased in to million metric tons 
worldwide graphite electrode demand increased to approximately million metric tons driven by increased steel production and  in particular  eaf steel production 
graphite electrode supply remained tight for graphite electrodes used in eaf melter applications 
graphite electrode prices for the eaf melter segment increased over the course of we believe that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate was about in we operated our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at virtually maximum operating levels throughout we estimate that worldwide aluminum production was about million metric tons in  about higher than in demand for cathodes increased slightly in as compared to  primarily due to the construction of new aluminum smelting furnaces  offset by delays in relines of existing furnaces as a result of longer pot life from technology improvements 
consolidation of aluminum companies  including alcan s acquisition of pechiney  also delayed the start of known new smelter projects 
we believe that  in  there was an excess supply of cathodes  on a worldwide basis 
demand for carbon refractories strengthened consistent with growth in integrated steel production in and related increases in blast furnace lining refurbishments and  to a lesser extent  new blast furnace construction 
demand for carbon electrodes strengthened consistent with increases in production of silicon metal 
demand for our advanced graphite materials strengthened in as compared to  consistent with increased production by the customers we serve in the semiconductor  electronics  energy and transportation industries 
throughout  we experienced upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based raw materials 
these cost increases impacted almost all of our product lines 
we believe these cost increases were experienced industry wide 
demand for thermal management solutions in smaller  more powerful electronic devices continued to grow rapidly in our etm solutions are enabling some of the most advanced  thinnest and lightest products being sold today 
these devices include  among others  plasma display panels  liquid crystal displays  ultra lightweight laptops and cell phones 
sales of our etm products grew significantly to  in as compared to  in graphite electrode demand is primarily linked with the global production of steel in electric arc furnaces and  to a lesser extent  with the total production of steel and certain other metals 
this production is linked to global and regional economic conditions 
overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about an increase as compared to china s steel production  however  grew almost in and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
although approximately of chinese steel production is blast oxygen furnace steel production  china is also the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity continued to grow  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a more favorable global pricing environment in notwithstanding the growth in worldwide steel production  the steel industry in most of our major markets operated at lower operating rates in we believe that these lower operating rates resulted in a reduction of steel inventories in the us and  to a lesser extent  in other regions of the world 
our venture with alcan pechiney  which is a owner of our cathode business and which purchases cathodes from us under requirements contracts that remain in effect through  continues to position us as the leading supplier of cathodes to the aluminum industry 
our refractories business is linked primarily to construction and refurbishment of blast furnaces in the integrated segment of the global steel industry and  to a lesser extent  submerged arc furnaces in the ferroalloy industry 
we have benefited from the growth of steel production in china through  and have expanded our global sales to large markets such as india and russia as well as several smaller markets 
excluding china  carbon electrode demand in was essentially the same as in in  certain silicon metal producers who are the primary carbon electrode consumers announced plans to idle capacity 
we expect growth in china to continue to replace idle capacity elsewhere  leaving overall demand relatively flat in the near future 
carbon electrode average selling prices in remained at levels 
demand for our advanced graphite materials increased in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  silicon and oil and gas exploration  and defense and transportation industries 
we operated our advanced graphite materials capacity at very high levels in demand for thermal management solutions in smaller  thinner  more powerful electronic devices continued to grow rapidly in our etm solutions are enabling some of the most advanced  thinnest and lightest products being sold today 
these devices include  among others  flat panel displays  plasma and liquid crystal display lcd  ultra lightweight laptops  cell phones  and led lighting applications 
the flat panel display market is expected to grow from million units of the tv market to million units by sales of our etm products grew significantly  to about million in as compared to about million in throughout  we continued to experience upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based materials 
these cost increases impacted almost all of our product lines 
outlook 
global and regional economic conditions are expected to remain relatively stable in  with global eaf steel production growth of approximately 
we estimate that worldwide total steel production will increase to about billion metric tons in  about higher than in worldwide graphite electrode demand is also expected to remain stable in we expect demand growth of approximately  driven primarily by new eaf product capacity and higher eaf operating rates 
we expect net sales of graphite electrodes to increase approximately in we expect graphite electrode sales volume to be approximately  to  metric tons  depending on market conditions 
we expect upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based raw materials 
these cost increases will impact almost all of our product lines 
we believe our graphite electrode production costs will increase approximately to in as compared to we estimate that worldwide production of aluminum will increase in by about over we expect demand for cathodes in to increase as compared to  primarily due to the construction of new aluminum smelting furnaces and increased demand for relining  or expansion  of existing smelters 
we believe that  in  there will be an excess supply of cathodes  on a worldwide basis 
in  we believe that the overall demand for advanced graphite materials will remain at a high level  resulting from continued strength in the energy markets and defense and transportation industries 
in  we expect continued strong demand for our carbon refractories 
the integrated steel industry is expected to remain strong through  with growth continuing in china  india  and brazil 
a number of large expansion projects are known to be in the planning  engineering  and early construction phases 
in addition  the chinese government has announced its intention to close all small  inefficient blast furnaces  which we believe will require significant replacement capacity in the coming years 
for  we expect net sales of etm products of about million 
we continue to see the need for efficient thermal management in electronic devices as a major challenge for manufacturers 
the move toward increased functionality and convergence is creating the need for larger amounts of memory in devices  larger color displays in portable devices  wireless and increased speed of data transmission  all resulting in significant thermal management issues 
as a result  our etm materials and solutions address these challenges and at the same time enable device manufacturers to capitalize on these growing trends in a more cost efficient manner 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions during  we repurchased senior notes for cash or in exchange for shares of our common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detailed information 
on january   we completed an offering of  aggregate principal amount of debentures at a price of of principal amount 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately  we used the net proceeds to repay the remaining  of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  to make provisional payments of  against the fine the eu antitrust fine that was assessed against us in by the directorate general iv of the european communities the eu competition authority  and to fund general corporate purposes  including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable and strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our businesses 
the balance was invested in short term  investment quality  interest bearing securities or deposits 
on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing has enhanced our stability and liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july as a result of the refinancing  we have no material debt scheduled to mature prior to july antitrust litigation against us in  the doj and the eu competition authority commenced investigations into alleged violations of the antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
the antitrust authorities in canada  japan and korea subsequently began similar investigations 
the eu competition authority also commenced an investigation into alleged antitrust violations in connection with the sale of specialty graphite 
these antitrust investigations have been resolved 
several of the investigations resulted in the imposition of fines against us 
these fines  or payments in accordance with a payment schedule in the case of the doj antitrust fine  have been timely paid 
we have settled virtually all of the civil antitrust lawsuits including class action lawsuits previously pending against us  certain civil antitrust lawsuits threatened against us and certain possible civil antitrust claims against us arising out of alleged antitrust violations occurring prior to the date of the relevant settlement in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes  carbon electrodes and bulk graphite products 
all settlement payments due have been timely paid 
there remain  however  certain pending claims as well as pending lawsuits in the us relating to the sale of graphite electrodes sold to foreign customers 
it is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the us or other jurisdictions 
we are currently not reserved for such matters 
other proceedings against us on march   the company was served with a complaint commencing a securities class action in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint alleges that gti and certain of our executive officers violated federal securities law by making false statements or failing to disclose adverse facts about us in  or in relation to  a press release issued by us on november  our analysis and investigation relating to this lawsuit is in its earliest stages  and  as a result  we are not able to assess the likelihood of loss  if any  or the amount thereof 
we have not yet filed a response to the complaint 
we intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 
we are involved in various other investigations  lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of them  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
product warranties we generally sell products with a limited warranty 
we accrue for known warranty claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
claims accrued but not yet paid amounted to at december  and at december  the following table presents the activity in this accrual for balance at december  product warranty charges  payments and settlements  balance at december  realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had  of gross deferred income tax assets  of which  required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had  of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are classified on a net current and net non current basis for each tax jurisdiction 
the net change in gross deferred income tax assets for was an increase of  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter with a full valuation allowance 
the net change in the total valuation allowance for was a increase of  during the year end financial accounting closing process  we determined that the timing of when we will generate sufficient us taxable income to realize our us deferred tax assets became less certain 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance of  against deferred tax assets in the us and  in certain us jurisdictions  which resulted in a total net charge of  until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient us taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be full reserved 
this adjustment does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability in the us we are executing current strategies  and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
the current us tax attributes  if utilized  will allow us to significantly reduce our cash tax obligations in the us we currently expect our overall book tax rate to be to and our overall cash tax rate to be to 
customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in and of our net sales in in  four of our ten largest customers were based in europe  three were in the us and one was in each of brazil  canada  and korea 
in  three of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non graphite electrode products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations financial information discussed below omits our non strategic composite tooling business that was sold in june and has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
the results of our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations 
compared to consolidated 
net sales of  in represented a  or  increase from net sales of  in primarily due to higher net sales of graphite electrodes  which increased  primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton 
higher sales volumes of carbon refractory products resulted in an increase of  while higher electronic thermal management sales resulted in an increase of  the remaining  increase in net sales occurred almost equally within advanced graphite materials and cathodes 
cost of sales of  in represented a  or  increase from cost of sales of  in cost of sales increased  due to higher sales volumes and the impact of a less favorable product sales mix   due to the net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes   due to higher operating costs and  primarily due to increased electronic thermal management sales  partially offset by  of improvements of productivity throughout our manufacturing network 
gross profit of  in represented a  or  increase from gross profit of  in gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in see below for further details regarding such changes 
selling  administrative and other expenses increased  from  in to  in the increase was due to investments to improve global business processes  primarily new global information systems and sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
these changes in business processes resulted in higher costs of  in addition  we incurred higher selling expenses of  in as a result of higher net sales 
the net unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates increased costs by  these higher costs were partially offset by  of lower employee benefit costs consisting primarily of lower variable compensation expenses and  to a lesser extent  lower post retirement expense 
other costs which increased selling  administrative and other expenses were individually insignificant 
research and development expenses decreased  from  in to  in the decrease was primarily due to both higher benefits from external funding proceeds from grants awarded to us in by the state of ohio to support fuel cell development programs and lower net costs due to our voluntary severance programs and workforce attrition 
these personnel reductions are net of increases in research and development resources dedicated to electronic thermal management development activities 
other income expense  net  was expense of  in as compared to income of  in the net increase in expense of  was primarily due to the following losses due to changes in currency exchange rates  primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans  increasing  for as compared to  losses attributable to a reduction of senior notes outstanding due to debt for equity exchanges and repurchases  increasing  for as compared to  expenses pertaining to legal  environmental and other related costs increasing  for as compared to  offset by losses on foreign currency exchange rate contract  decreasing  for as compared to  charges for employee benefit curtailment and other costs  decreasing  for as compared to  and other costs  net  decreasing  in as compared to in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of  consisting of an  charge associated with the closure and settlement with certain of our u 
s pension plans  with the remaining primarily due to further organizational changes 
in  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of  comprised primarily of the following a  net benefit associated with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy consisting of a reduction in cost estimate  partially offset by the completion of further severance agreements for employees terminated in connection with the closure  offset by a  charge relating primarily to severance programs and related benefits associated with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom  and a charge associated primarily with changes in estimates related to us voluntary and selective severance programs 
the restructuring accrual is included in other accrued liabilities and other long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheets

we recorded a  charge in relating to the eu antitrust fine 
we recorded a  charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims in the first quarter 
this charge was offset by a gain due to the refund of million  based on currency exchange rates then in effect that we received from the eu competition authority as a result of the reduction of the eu antitrust fine to million  plus accrued interest of a million which was calculated at a rate of per annum  an aggregate of about million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on our appeal thereof was issued 
the following table presents an analysis of interest expense for the year ended december  dollars in thousands interest incurred on debt   interest rate swap benefit   amortization of fair value adjustments for terminated hedge instruments   accelerated amortization of fair value adjustments for terminated hedge instruments due to reduction of senior notes  amortization of debt issuance costs   interest on doj antitrust fine  including imputed interest amortization of premium on senior notes amortization of discount on debentures interest incurred on other items interest expense   average total debt outstanding was  in as compared to  in the average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual rates include the benefits of our interest rate swaps  but exclude imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine  the amortization of the effective discount on the debentures  the amortization of the net proceeds from the sale of swaps and the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchange of common stock for  and repurchases of  senior notes outstanding 
we recorded interest income in of  primarily attributable to interest earned on cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of the debentures 
provision for income taxes was a charge of  in as compared to a charge of  in the effective income tax rate was in the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of a standard tax election known as check the box the special tax election that accelerated  of taxable income in the us that resulted in the utilization of approximately  in deferred tax assets  of which approximately  were existing foreign tax credits 
this resulted in tax expense that was  higher in than if we had not made this election 
the effective rate in was also impacted by a benefit from the eu competition authority refund  which was non taxable in the us  and by nondeductible expenses associated with certain restructuring charges 
the effective income tax rate was not meaningful in because we incurred income tax expense of  even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of  primarily due to tax expense of  associated with nondeductible antitrust related charges and an additional  from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective income tax rate was in and in  in each case excluding the impact of restructuring charges  antitrust charges or benefits  and the tax expense resulting from the special tax election 
during  we recorded a gain from the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business 
the discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of in as a result of the matters described above  net income was  in as compared to net loss of  in synthetic graphite 
net sales of  in represented a  or  increase from net sales of  in  primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton 
volume of graphite electrodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of  in net sales 
average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in was  per metric ton as compared to  per metric ton in the higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of  in net sales  approximately one third of which was due to the positive impact of net changes in currency exchange rates 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of  due primarily to changes in product and geographical mix 
the remaining  increase in net sales in the synthetic graphite segment occurred almost equally within advanced graphite materials and cathodes 
advanced graphite materials sales increased primarily due to the strengthening in the semiconductor  electronics  energy and transportation markets 
higher volumes of products sold increased net sales by  while improved pricing increased net sales by  remaining increases were due to net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes 
cathode net sales increased primarily due to  net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes and  due to a favorable change in product mix  offset by negative pricing impacts 
cost of sales of  in represented a  or  increase from cost of sales of  in cost of sales increased  due to higher sales volumes and the impact of a less favorable product sales mix   due to the net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes and  due to higher operating costs  partially offset by  of improvements in productivity throughout our manufacturing network and of improvements in other costs

as a result  gross profit in was  or  higher than in gross margin was of net sales in  while gross margin was of net sales in compared to consolidated 
net sales of  in represented a  or  increase from net sales of  in net sales of graphite electrodes increased  primarily due to higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton  offset by lower sales volumes and a less favorable product sales mix 
advanced graphite materials net sales increased  due primarily to higher sales volumes and improved pricing 
net sales of cathodes increased  due to higher sales volumes along with a more favorable product sales mix  offset by negative pricing impacts 
net sales of natural graphite increased  primarily due to an increase in etm net sales  partially offset by decreases in sales of other natural graphite products 
remaining increases in net sales were primarily due to an increase in net sales of carbon electrodes  primarily driven by increased volumes 
cost of sales of  in represented a  or  increase from cost of sales of  in cost of sales increased  due to higher operating costs   due to a less favorable product sales mix   due to the net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and  due to other costs  partially offset by a decrease of  due to lower sales volumes

we expect to record additional charges of approximately million in and million in related to such initiatives 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we announced plans to shut down carbon electrode production operations at our columbia  tennessee manufacturing facility 
this plan is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of we expect to record total charges of approximately million throughout and related to such shut down 
as a result of the rationalization of our synthetic graphite facilities  we expect to achieve both operating efficiencies and production cost savings 
the restructuring of our graphite electrode facilities is aimed at improving our operating performance  including leveraging our infrastructure for greater productivity and contributing to our continued growth 
we anticipate annualized cost savings between million and million  with the full benefit of such savings expected to be realized in and beyond

other segment and corporate related primarily to remaining lease payments on our former corporate headquarters  and related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from wilmington  delaware to our research development center in parma  ohio 
in  we recorded a  charge related to the impairment of our long lived carbon electrode fixed assets in columbia  tennessee as a result of our fourth quarter review of our carbon electrode forecasts 
the future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets were below their respective carrying amounts 
as a result  an impairment loss was measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and fair value  which was based on current estimates of market price 
we recorded a  charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims in the first quarter 
this charge was offset by a gain due to the refund of million  based on currency exchange rates then in effect that we received from the eu competition authority as a result of the reduction of the eu antitrust fine to million  plus accrued interest of a million which was calculated at a rate of per annum  an aggregate of about million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on our appeal thereof was issued

provision for income taxes was a charge of  in as compared to a charge of  in the effective income tax rate was approximately in the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a charge resulting from a net change in the total valuation allowance for of  during the year end financial accounting closing process  we determined that the timing of when we will generate sufficient us taxable income to realize our us deferred tax assets became less certain  therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance  primarily against our net federal deferred tax assets in the us  of  we recorded similar valuation allowances in certain other jurisdictions in both the second and fourth quarters of  which resulted in charges totaling  the effective income tax rate was in the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of the special tax election that accelerated approximately  of taxable income in the us that resulted in the utilization of approximately  in deferred tax assets  of which approximately  were existing foreign tax credits  and  of net operating loss carryforward

as a result of the matters described above  our net loss was  in as compared to net income of  in synthetic graphite 
net sales of  in represented a  or  increase from net sales of  in net sales of graphite electrodes increased  primarily due to higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton  offset by lower sales volumes and a less favorable product sales mix 
the average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in was  per metric ton as compared to the average in of  per metric ton 
the higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of  in net sales  including the net unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
volume of graphite electrodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the lower volumes of graphite electrodes sold represented a decrease of  in net sales and resulted primarily from pricing initiatives 
the effect of a less favorable product sales mix decreased net sales  other decreases in net sales amounted to  advanced graphite materials net sales increased  due primarily to higher sales volumes  which increased net sales  and improved pricing  which increased net sales  including the net favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates of net sales of cathodes increased  due to higher sales volumes of  along with a more favorable product sales mix of  offset by negative pricing impacts 
cost of sales of  in represented an  or  increase from cost of sales of  in cost of sales increased  due to higher operating costs   due to a less favorable product sales mix   due to the net unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and  due to other costs  partially offset by a decrease of  due to lower sales volumes 
as a result  gross profit in was  or  higher than in gross margin was of net sales in  while gross margin was of net sales in other 
net sales of  in represented a  or  increase from net sales of  in net sales of natural graphite increased  primarily due to an increase in etm net sales of  partially offset by decreases in sales of other natural graphite products  primarily relating to softer automotive end market conditions 
remaining increases in net sales of the other segment were primarily due to an increase in net sales of carbon electrodes  primarily driven by increased volumes 
cost of sales of  in represented an  or  increase from cost of sales of  in the cost of sales of carbon electrodes increased  due to higher sales volumes and higher costs 
cost of sales of natural graphite increased  primarily due to an increase in certain higher raw material costs and higher overhead costs 
remaining increases were primarily within refractories and were due primarily to higher production costs 
as a result  gross profit in was  or  lower than in gross margin was of net sales in  while gross margin was of net sales in effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
during the past three years  we experienced higher freight  energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum based raw materials 
we seek to mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales through improved operating efficiencies  higher prices for our products and ongoing cost savings  and  in some cases  fixed price or derivative contracts 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
at december   we had fixed about of our worldwide natural gas exposure through using such contracts 
as of february   we had fixed about of our worldwide natural gas exposure through such contracts 
currency translation and transactions we account for our non us subsidiaries under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders deficit and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
highly inflationary economies are defined as having cumulative inflation of about or more over a period of three calendar years 
in general  the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations rather than as part of stockholders deficit on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have subsidiaries in russia  mexico  brazil and other countries which have had in the past  and may have in the future  highly inflationary economies 
we account for our mexican and russian subsidiaries using the dollar as their functional currency  as sales and purchases for each subsidiary are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur costs in dollars and the currency of each of the six non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  and we sell our products in multiple currencies 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and  to a limited extent  each other 
when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by us  which is priced in dollars 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income

at december   the aggregate principal amount of these loans was  these loans are subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
a portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations

in  we had a net total of  of currency losses  including  of exchange losses due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  payment of restructuring costs  pension and post retirement contributions  debt reduction payments and other obligations 
we are highly leveraged and have other substantial obligations 
at december   we had total debt of  cash and cash equivalents of  and a stockholders deficit of  as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable and payments thereof to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling  in and  in during  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling  at a cost lower than the cost to borrow a comparable amount for a comparable period under the revolving facility 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been unchanged at december  and about  higher at december  all such receivables sold during were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold remained on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as well as cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to million 
at december    was available after consideration of outstanding revolving and swingline loans of  and outstanding letters of credit of 
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the revolving facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the senior notes  the debentures and the revolving facility  as applicable 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants over the next twelve months 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
at december   or  of our total debt excluding the fair value adjustments to debt and the unamortized bond premium and including the original value of the debenture derivative liability relating to the debentures redemption feature with a make whole provision consists of variable rate obligations 
such amount includes  outstanding under the revolving facility and  of other debt 
at december   the revolving facility had an effective interest rate of  our  principal amount of senior notes had a fixed rate of and an effective rate of including the effect of the amortization of fair value adjustments for terminated hedge instruments and our  principal amount of debentures had a fixed rate of 
we estimate interest expense to be approximately million for we continue to implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report

pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information services 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi managed our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
this contract was amended  effective september  to reduce the scope of cgi s management of our data center services  networks  desktops and telecommunications 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide any of these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the third quarter  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi valued at that time at million 
such amounts are excluded from the above table  as these amounts do not include an unconditional purchase obligation 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our finance and accounting business process services bps  including accounts receivable and accounts payable activities  and provided various related analytical services such as general accounting  cost accounting and financial analysis activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a memorandum of agreement with cgi  terminating such services 
the memorandum was entered into after the parties determined that the termination of the contract was in their mutual best interest 
such termination is effective during the first quarter of thereafter  we will be solely and entirely responsible for all of the services previously rendered by cgi under the contract 
b consists of the outstanding balance of the doj antitrust fine 
c represents estimated postretirement  pension and related benefits obligations based on actuarial calculations 
d excludes the accounting for deferred financing costs or gains on the sale of hedge instruments 
payments assume senior notes  with a fixed rate of interest of  mature on february  and the debentures  with a fixed rate of interest of  effectively mature on january  e local lines of credit are established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of the revolving facility 
the total amount available under the lines of credit amounted to million at december  cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
as a result of our significant leverage and other substantial obligations  our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
accordingly  we have placed the highest priority on accelerating the amount and speed of cash generated every day 
our efforts include leveraging our unique global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
in addition  we may exchange or repurchase senior notes or debentures as described below 
we also continue to evaluate other opportunities to reduce our obligations  including the obligations associated with our us defined benefit plan  which was frozen in typically  the first quarter of each year results in neutral or negative cash flow from operations due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements and other factors 
typically  the other three quarters result in positive cash flow from operations 
the third quarter tends to produce relatively less positive cash flow from operations primarily as a result of scheduled plant shutdowns by our customers for vacations 
our cash flow from operations in the first and third quarters typically is adversely impacted by the semi annual interest payments on the senior notes and the debentures 
the second and fourth quarters correspondingly benefit from the absence of such interest payments 
in addition to the above factors  in and  we had negative cash flow from operations primarily due to payments in connection with restructurings  antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and uses of cash from working capital 
in  we had positive cash flow from operations despite continued payments in connection with restructurings and antitrust investigations and the continued use of cash for working capital to  among other things  build inventories 
for  we expect increasingly positive cash flows from operations 
in addition to the factors described above  we expect a weaker than normal first quarter due to  lower sales and profit because of weaker than normal customer shipments because graphite electrode customers took full contract volumes in the fourth quarter and a higher use of cash for temporarily higher inventory because of higher graphite electrode operating levels in the first quarter as compared to the lower shipments 
this is expected to result in negative cash flow during the first quarter and debt levels that may be million or more higher in the first quarter than those at the year end and generally higher than the average level expected for the full year as part of our cash management activities  we seek to manage accounts receivable credit risk and collections  and payment of accounts payable to seek to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide were only of global net sales during the last years 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that our business strategies will continue to improve the amount and speed of cash generated from operations under current economic conditions 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these strategies are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs while they are being implemented 
we also believe that our planned asset sales together with these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt and other obligations over the long term 
we may from time to time and at any time repurchase senior notes or debentures in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
these purchases may be effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under the revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  in exchange for common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
our high leverage and other substantial obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and other obligations thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our leverage and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of our business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although we cannot assure you that such will be the case  we believe that  based on our expected cash flow from operations  our existing capital resources  and taking into account our working capital needs and our efforts to reduce costs  improve efficiencies and product quality and accelerate commercialization of new products and cash flow  we will be able to manage our liquidity to permit us to service our debt and meet our obligations when due 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in related party transactions 
since january   we have not engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet and compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral  executive employee loans and stock purchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments 
we have not undertaken or been a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements or other commitments including non exchange traded contracts  other than interest rate caps  interest rate swaps  currency exchange rate contracts and natural gas contracts  which are described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commitments under non cancelable operating leases that  at december   totaled no more than million in each year and about  in the aggregate  and  at december   totaled no more than million in each year and about  in the aggregate 
minimum required purchase commitments under our information technology outsourcing services agreement with cgi described above that  at december   totaled approximately million in each year and about  in the aggregate and at december   totaled no more than million in each year and about  in the aggregate

other uses in consisted of  of payments for antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims   of restructuring costs related to severance and related payments and  of other payments consisting primarily of pension and post retirement contributions and payments 
cash flow used in investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was  in   in and  in cash used in investing activities was  in capital expenditures in were  capital expenditures related primarily to the expansion of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity  implementation of people soft enterprise one formerly known as jd edwards one world information systems and essential capital maintenance

cash used in investing activities was  in capital expenditures in were  and related primarily to the expansion of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity  including expansion of our graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in spain  france  and south africa  implementation of people soft enterprise one formerly known as jd edwards one world information systems and essential capital maintenance 
other investing uses of  pertained primarily to the purchase of derivative instruments 
such uses were offset by  in proceeds from the sale of assets  primarily pertaining to the sale of our fixed assets in connection with closure of our advanced synthetic graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom 
cash used in investing activities was  in capital expenditures amounted to  in and related primarily to graphite electrode productivity and production stability initiatives and other essential capital maintenance 
such uses were offset primarily by proceeds from the sale of derivative instruments and the sale of other assets 
other investing uses of  pertained primarily to payments in connection with the sale of interest rate swaps 
such uses were partially offset by  from the sale of certain assets 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow provided by financing activities was  in   in and  in during  we received net proceeds of  from a registered public offering of common stock and  from the sale of interest rate swaps 
we used these proceeds primarily to repay term loans of  outstanding under the senior facilities  reduce the outstanding balance under the revolving facility and repay other short term debt 
cash provided by financing activities was  in during  we received gross proceeds of  less issuance costs of  from the issuance and sale of the debentures and  from the exercise of stock options 
we used these proceeds to repay term loans of  outstanding under the senior facilities  to pay  primarily to the eu competition authority and to replace cash previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable as described above in cash flow used in operating activities 
in addition  we purchased  aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest  for  in cash 
cash provided by financing activities was  in during  we incurred borrowings of  primarily under the revolving facility 
we used these net borrowings to fund working capital requirements  primarily inventory that we have replenished and built in anticipation of stronger demand 
such borrowings were offset by payments under the revolving facility of  and  in financing and other costs 
costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection   capital expenditures related to environmental protection  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
accounting for financial instruments requires us to make judgments about the value of those instruments at specified dates 
while we believe that our estimates of values are reasonable  if the actual values are significantly different than the estimated values  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
derivative liability associated with our debentures 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the redemption option and its make whole provision the redemption make whole option contained in the debentures  qualify as an embedded derivative that was not clearly and closely related to the characteristics of the debentures upon issuance 
since the redemption make whole option does not currently qualify for any scope exception within sfas no 
 it is required by sfas no 
to be accounted for separately from the debt instrument and recorded as derivative financial instruments 
the embedded derivative financial instrument was classified as a derivative liability upon issuance and is included in other long term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet 
we estimate the fair value of the redemption make whole option using a financial model that uses several assumptions  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining maturity and the closing price of our common stock to determine estimated fair value of our derivative liability 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock during each quarterly period 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss or gain from a loss or gain contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or a gain has become receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss or gain can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss or gain from a contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss or gain  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the discounted future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  significant increases or decreases in our cost of capital  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  companies are to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting  which accounting principles board opinion apb no 
allowed and resulted in no expense for many awards of stock options for which the exercise price of the option equaled the price of the underlying stock at the grant date 
in addition  sfas no 
r retains the modified grant date model from sfas no 
under that model  compensation cost is measured at the grant date and adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of certain conditions 
the fair value of an award is not remeasured after its initial estimation on the grant date except in the case of a liability award or if the award is modified 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  we will be required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of the actual impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r will depend upon the amount  nature and type of stock based compensation awards outstanding upon implementation and that we may issue in the future 
based on the current stock based compensation plans in effect and awards issued  our estimated expense in for stock based compensation is   of which relates to restricted stock grants and of which relates to unvested stock options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk unless otherwise noted  all dollars are presented in thousands we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commercial energy rates and changes to the fair value of the redemption make whole option 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
our exposure to changes in the fair value of the redemption make whole option results primarily from changes in the closing price of our common stock 
interest rate management 
we implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
use of these initiatives is allowed under the senior notes and the revolving facility 
we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate debt represented by the senior notes into variable rate debt 
at december   we had swaps for a notional amount of million 
at december   we had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
at december    out of our total outstanding million notional amount of interest rate swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the related debt called a fair value hedge 
the related debt for those swaps is the senior notes  of which  aggregate principal amount was outstanding at december  at december  excluding the offsetting value of our interest rate caps  the principal value of our debt was reduced by  as a result of our current fair value hedges 
the market values of those interest rate swaps  excluding changes in value resulting from accrued interest payable or receivable from the counterparty  are recorded as part of other long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
accrued interest receivable from or payable to the counterparty is recorded as a component of interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the remaining million of our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of any specific debt instrument 
any changes in the market value of those swaps are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations 
in  the mark to market impact of the undesignated swaps was all of our swaps are valued monthly  and we are required to provide cash collateral to the counterparty to the extent that the fair market value of the swap liability  net of the fair market value of our interest rate caps  exceeds a specific threshold 
at december   all of our swaps were with one counterparty and this threshold was million 
we were not required to provide any cash collateral at december  during the first quarter of  we sold million notional amount of undesignated swaps and paid a nominal fee 
additionally  we sold million notional amount of our fair value hedge swaps and paid  in cash 
immediately thereafter  we repurchased million notional amount of fair value hedge swaps with a different counterparty 
during the second quarter of  we sold million notional amount of swaps and paid  during the fourth quarter of  we sold million notional amount of swaps and paid  as a result of these transactions  at december   we had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
at december   the variable interest rate was calculated based on the six month libor rate as of the date of payment plus  calculated in arrears 
during  a portion of the variable interest rate was calculated based on the six month libor rate as of the date of payment plus calculated in arrears and a portion of the variable interest rate was calculated based on the six month libor  set in advance  plus 
at december   the senior notes are at a fixed rate of per annum 
when we sell a fair value hedge swap  the gain or loss is amortized as a credit or charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
when we effectively reduce the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes through debt for equity exchanges  repurchases or otherwise  the related portion of such credit or charge is accelerated and recorded in the period in which such reduction occurs 
at december  and  the principal value of our debt was increased by  and  respectively  as a result of gains realized from previously sold swaps 
the net impact of current and terminated hedge instruments was a  and a  increase in the fair value of our debt at december  and  respectively  and was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on the line entitled fair value adjustments for hedge instruments 
additional information with respect to the impact of our swaps on interest expense is set forth under interest expense in note to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference 
we enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to the incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure  represented by the net impact of our swaps on the senior notes  to no greater than per annum 
at december   we had interest rate caps for a notional amount of million 
during  we sold all of our outstanding interest rate caps 
all of our interest rate caps are marked to market monthly 
gains and losses are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value adjustment on caps was a loss for  a  loss for  and a loss for currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to euro denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments  which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
the notional amount of open foreign exchange contracts  used by us to minimize foreign currency exposure against euro depreciation  amounted to  at december  in  one contract expired and we sold all remaining open foreign exchange contracts 
as a result  at december   we had no such contracts outstanding 
gains and losses associated with these contracts amounted to a loss of  in  a loss of in and a gain of  in commercial energy rate management 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
the unrealized gain on outstanding contracts at december  amounted to at december   we had fixed about of our worldwide natural gas exposure through using such contracts 
the outstanding contracts at december  were a nominal receivable 
as of february   we had fixed about of our worldwide natural gas exposure through such contracts 
we are required to provide cash collateral to certain counterparties to the extent that the fair market value of the natural gas derivative contracts exceeds a specific threshold 
at december   this threshold was million 
we were not required to provide any cash collateral at december  derivative liability associated with the debentures 
the redemption make whole option is accounted for separately from the underlying debt evidenced by the debentures and is recorded as a derivative financial instrument 
the embedded derivative financial instrument was classified as a derivative liability upon issuance and is included in the other long term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the derivative liability to its estimated fair value 
upon issuance at january   the estimated fair value of the derivative liability was  at december   the estimated fair value of the derivative liability was  at december   the estimated fair value of the derivative liability was  we estimate the fair value by using a financial model that uses several assumptions  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining maturity and the closing price of our common stock 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin  changes in interest rates on interest expense and changes in the more relevant variables on the redemption make whole option for particularly our current stock price  historical stock price volatility and borrowing costs 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million 
in addition  based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all maturities would have increased our interest expense for by about million 
the sensitivity analysis used to assess the potential effect of changes in the more relevant variables impacting the redemption make whole option which was based on hypothetical changes of did not result in material changes
