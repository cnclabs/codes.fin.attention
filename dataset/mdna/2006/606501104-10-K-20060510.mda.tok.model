controls and procedures  as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us and our representatives in other reports  filings with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec  press releases  conferences  or otherwise  may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section le of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
this information includes  without limitation  statements concerning o our future financial position and results of operations  o planned capital expenditures  o our business strategy and other plans for future operations  o the future mix of revenues and business  o our commitments and contingent liabilities  o future demand for our services  and o predicted improvement in energy industry and seismic service industry conditions 

table of contents although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company and our management  identify forward looking statements 
the actual results of future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth below in item a 
risk factors and elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors demand for land based seismic data is not assured demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by o oil and gas prices and industry perceptions of future price levels  o the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  o the availability of current geophysical data  o the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and o local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry has a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  prices of oil and gas  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated substantially 
this has  in the past  and may  in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
loss of significant customers will adversely affect us we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  the single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
because our customer base is relatively small  the loss of one or more customers for any reason could adversely affect our results of operations 
significant defaults of past due customer accounts would adversely affect our results of operations on january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and notes receivable of which million was over days past due 
at january  we had an allowance of million to cover losses in our receivable balances 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
international economic and political instability could adversely our results of operations our results of operations are dependent upon the current political and economic climate of several countries in which our customers either operate or are located 
international sources including canada accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended january  since the majority of our lease and sales contracts with our customers are denominated in us  australian  canadian and singapore dollars and british pounds  there is some risk of economic loss from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
however  our internationally sourced revenues are still subject to the risk of currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars  taxation policies  and expropriation  as well as to political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other hazards 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates have increasingly materially affected our results of operations for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of the canadian  australian  united kingdom  singapore and russian subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has become material because of the significant amount of equipment assigned to our canadian and australian operations and the fluctuations in the canadian and australian dollar exchange rates over the last few years 
our operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of three to nine months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment on the initial lease 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lessees are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other customers after the termination of the original leases  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we depend on key personnel our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer  mr 
michael pinnington  our managing director of seamap uk and mr 
mark welker  our managing director of seamap pte ltd 
mr 
mitcham s employment agreement is automatically renewed on a year to year basis until terminated by either party giving days notice prior to the end of the current term subject to earlier termination on certain stated events 
the agreement prohibits mr 
mitcham from engaging in any business activities that are competitive with our business and from diverting any of our customers to a competitor for two years after the termination of his employment 
both mr 
pinnington and mr 
welker have a five year employment agreement with the company effective july that prohibits them from engaging in a similar business as the company for a period of seven years  should they leave employment of the company 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham  mr 
pinnington or mr 
welker could have a material adverse effect on the company 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment  and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers 
weather conditions cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in leasing revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada from january through march or april 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 

table of contents we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than us 
we believe that our competitors  in general  have neither as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do  or similar exclusive lease referral agreements with suppliers 
competition exists to a lesser extent from seismic data acquisition contractors that may lease equipment that is temporarily idle 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenue from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our suppliers 
however  should those relationships deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining the existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these could adversely affect our future results of operations 
our stock price is subject to volatility due to recent energy industry conditions  energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been extremely volatile 
such stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing 
possible adverse effect of anti takeover provisions  potential issuance of preferred stock certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business corporation act may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with such preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock 
although we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which in turn are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
due to our unique position as the largest independent lessor of seismic equipment  we believe that we are privy to information about future projects from many data acquisition contractors 
as a result  the seismic exploration market is improving 
we believe that this increase is being driven by historically high world oil and north american natural gas prices  combined with the maturation of the world s hydrocarbon producing basins 
the future direction and magnitude of changes in seismic data acquisition activity levels will continue to be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices 
we lease and sell seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offer technical support during the lease term 
the majority of all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
from time to time  we sell lease pool equipment to our customers 
these sales are usually transacted when we have equipment that we do not have immediate or near term need for in our leasing business or if we desire to upgrade our lease pool 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
seamap s primary products include the industry leading range of gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems which now provide operators more precise control of their exploration tools and the buoylink gps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
while benefiting from the sales of existing designs  seamap continues to develop new products for the seismic industry including a new fairlead which streamlines streamer deployment 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
our lease revenue is seasonal  especially in canada and russia  where a significant percentage of seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from january through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other equipment because of the unstable terrain 
current prices of oil and natural gas have resulted in increased activity in the oil and gas industry resulting in an increased demand for seismic services 
this increased demand has contributed to an increased demand for leasing of our equipment 
we cannot predict how long the current trend will last  but we have learned that a depressed oil and gas industry results in lower demand  thus lower revenues from leasing our equipment 
the company does not quantitatively calculate utilization rates for its equipment lease pool 
however  we do subjectively monitor factors which we believe reflect trends in utilization 
for example  we believe that the increase in our leasing revenues and the relatively constant size of our lease pool can be attributed to an increase in utilization of our lease pool equipment 
the company has relatively fixed costs within certain revenue ranges and  as a result  our earnings are particularly sensitive to changes in utilization and demand for our lease equipment 
our operations and the utilization of our lease pool depend upon these levels of activity 
such activity levels typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile 
our revenues increased during and  which we believe resulted from an improvement in market conditions 
we believe that increased activity will result in a greater demand for our lease pool equipment  which will result in increased utilization of our lease pool equipment 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from international customers totaled million  million and million  representing  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian  canadian and singapore dollars and british pounds 
results of operations mitcham consolidated for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded income from continuing operations in the approximate amount of million  compared to income from continuing operations of approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  and a loss of million for the fiscal year ended january  we had no income or loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended january  compared to income of million for the fiscal year ended january  and a loss of million for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents during fiscal  our results of operations were affected by several significant factors 
our revenues increased million  reflecting a significant increase in leasing revenues of million and an increase in equipment sales of million primarily as a result of our acquisition of seamap 
the increase in revenues was attributable to several factors 
our increase in leasing revenues was largely attributable to the significant increase in leasing activities recorded by our us operations 
our fixed and variable costs are an important factor affecting our results of operations 
depreciation expense totaled million  and includes amortization of intangible assets in the amount of  for the year ended january  this expense will vary between periods based on acquisitions of new equipment and sales of equipment with remaining depreciable life 
direct cost of seismic leasing is a variable expense that fluctuates with our equipment leasing revenues 
the main components of this cost are freight  sublease expenses and repairs and maintenance  to the extent that repairs performed are normal wear and tear and not billable to the lease customer 
revenues mitcham consolidated for fiscal  our consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million from fiscal  representing increases in both leasing and sales activity for the year 
during fiscal  leasing revenues increased million  while seamap contributed million in equipment sales 
additionally  our leasing revenues significantly increased in our us operations and were complemented by moderate increases in our canadian and australian operations 
a weakened us dollar and its impact on foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing consolidated revenues during the year ended january  by million over the prior year 
for fiscal  consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million from fiscal  driven by increases in both leasing and sales activity during the year 
consolidated revenues for fiscal increased approximately million  or  from fiscal due mainly to increases in both leasing and sales activities for the year 
during fiscal  leasing revenues increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in our north american revenues  our expanding marine seismic business  our first large rental contract in the southeast asia market  and the inclusion of the operations of sap  which we acquired in december sap s revenues for fiscal were approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal seismic equipment sales for fiscal were million as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
seamap operations contributed million in equipment sales 
costs and expenses mitcham consolidated depreciation expense for fiscal amounted to million  including million amortization on intangible assets  which was million  or  lower than fiscal the depreciation totals are a sum of direct costs lease pool depreciation in the amount of million and depreciation and amortization totaling million 
for fiscal  depreciation expense was million  which was million  or  lower than fiscal depreciation expense 
during fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million 
at january   approximately million of our lease pool assets were fully depreciated 
this compares to million at january  these assets  though fully depreciated  are expected to generate revenue by either leasing activity or through a sale of that equipment 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing fiscal depreciation expense by approximately million 
for fiscal  foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing depreciation expense by million from the fiscal amount 
our business generally parallels trends in the oil and gas industry 
when the oil and gas industry was depressed over the period from to  we experienced net losses for those periods 
as the oil and gas industry is on an upward trend and we are experiencing increased demand for our equipment  including 
table of contents equipment that has been fully depreciated  increased demand for our equipment results in higher revenues and generally has no impact on depreciation in the short term as our equipment is depreciated from the first month it is placed in service until it is fully depreciated 
depreciation expense is recorded monthly whether or not the equipment is actually generating revenue on a lease contract 
during periods of high demand  such as the one we are currently experiencing  our ability to lease older equipment  including fully depreciated equipment is enhanced  whereas in periods of low demand  the opposite is true 
as a result  revenues and depreciation expense will not necessarily directly correlate 
over the long term  depreciation expense is impacted by increases in equipment purchases to meet growing demand for our leased equipment 
for example  we have been able to purchase equipment at discounts through volume purchase arrangements 
a lower purchase price results in lower depreciation expense than in previous periods 
these lower purchase prices are the sole reasons for the decrease in our cost basis as the total number of units of lease pool equipment have not materially decreased 
on the other hand  although some of the equipment in our lease pool has reached the end of its depreciable life  given the increased demand  that equipment continues to be in service and continues to generate revenue 
because the depreciable life of our equipment in our industry is determined more by technical obsolescence than by usage or wear and tear  some of our equipment  although fully depreciated  is still capable of functioning appropriately 
currently  in our industry  higher demand is generating more leasing revenue and older equipment is more in demand than in times past 
we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of million  which was approximately million higher than fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in activity related to seismic leasing during fiscal direct costs for fiscal were million  which was approximately million lower than fiscal direct costs 
for fiscal  direct costs totaled million  representing an increase of million from the fiscal direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  repairs and sublease expense 
sales of new equipment will typically have gross margins of to 
the gross margins on used equipment  on the other hand  will vary widely depending on the level of depreciation for each item at the time of sale 
in fiscal we had used lease pool equipment sales of million compared to million and million in fiscal and respectively 
cost of sales for this equipment was million  million and million for years  and respectively 
this yielded margins of in  in and in we had other equipment sales of million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
the cost of sales for other equipment sales was million  million and million for fiscal  and respectively 
this resulted in margins of for fiscal  for fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million  or million greater than fiscal expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million  or million greater than fiscal expenses of million 
the acquisition of seamap in fiscal resulted in an increase of general and administrative costs of million over the prior year along with additional increases in accounting fees of million and consulting fees of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in legal fees of million for fiscal during fiscal  we incurred one time severance related charges of approximately million related to the resignation of our former chief financial officer 
of this amount  million was recorded as a non cash stock based compensation expense 
additionally  during the year we incurred approximately million in non recurring professional fees related to the internal investigation of the company s internal controls that was conducted by the company earlier in the year 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to an increase in travel  customer relations  investor relations  insurance  compensation expenses  rent and utilities and professional fees 
during fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of   and  respectively 
at january  and  we had past due trade accounts and note receivables in the approximate amount of million and million  respectively 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable amounted to million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million against assets held for sale as a result of our decision to sell the operating assets of dsi 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal  however  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge against our seismic equipment lease pool in fiscal of this amount  million was attributable to land systems  cables  geophones and land peripherals and million was impaired in marine and other equipment 
we also recorded impairment of for slow moving and obsolete lease pool inventory during the year 
for fiscal  we had an income tax benefit of million as a result of a reduction of our valuation allowance by that same amount 
this compares to a million income tax expense in fiscal and no income tax expense in fiscal 
table of contents segment reporting we have two reportable segments for reporting results of operations 
the mitcham segment consists of the operations of mitcham industries  inc in huntsville  texas  mitcham canada ltd and sap

additionally  during fiscal we conducted a company wide physical inventory of our lease pool assets 
as a result  we recorded a charge in the approximate amount of  related to missing equipment that had remaining net book value 
this charge was recorded as a component of cost of goods sold for the year 
gross margins on equipment sales will vary significantly between periods due to the mix of sales revenue between new seismic equipment versus sales of depreciated seismic equipment being sold from our lease pool

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash flow statements for fiscal and have been restated 
footnote to the financials has a detailed breakdown of the changes that occurred due to the restatement 
our principal sources of cash have been cash flows from our short term leasing operations 
during fiscal  and  our cash flows from operating activities were affected by several significant factors 
the principal factor that has affected our cash flows is a marked increase in oil and gas exploration and development activities 
increases in the price of oil and natural gas  combined with the maturation of the world s hydrocarbon producing basins  have improved market conditions and have increased demand for our equipment 
as of january   we had net working capital of approximately million as compared to net working capital of million at january  and million in from to and to  our working capital increases are due to the increase in revenue of million and million respectively  an increase in trade receivables of million and million respectively and an increase in inventory of million 
also affecting the increase in working capital from to and from to is a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase of million respectively  and a decrease in current maturities of long term debt of million and million respectively 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our principal sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and proceeds from sales of lease pool equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million in and net cash provided by investing activities in of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended january  was million  compared to net cash used in financing activities for the years ended january  and january  of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year totaled approximately million as compared to capital expenditures of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our capital expenditures during the past three fiscal years were made primarily to fulfill specific lease contracts 
the company has been able to purchase new equipment for our lease pool at lower prices in recent years through volume purchasing discounts  which has allowed the company to maintain a constant level of equipment at a lower unit cost 
we do not anticipate that we will need to purchase more equipment than we would customarily purchase in order to sustain equipment leasing revenue growth  however  we may purchase additional equipment should favorable economic factors continue to exist 
million  net of million in cash  was used on the acquisition of seamap 
during fiscal  the company purchased million in certificates of deposit and redeemed million  with interest rates varying from to and maturities of six to nine months 
sales of used lease pool equipment generated cash flow of million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we fulfilled our million sercel purchase commitment in its entirety 
at january   we had trade accounts and notes receivable of million that were more than days past due 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  which management believes is sufficient to cover any losses in our trade accounts receivable and notes receivable 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance 
due to the uncertainty of collection  we do not recognize the interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
in most cases where we have a chronic collection problem with a particular customer  future business is done on a prepayment basis or if additional credit is extended  revenues are not recognized until collected 
although the extension of repayment terms on open accounts receivables temporarily reduces our cash flow from operations  we believe that this practice is necessary in light of seismic industry conditions and that it has not adversely affected our ability to conduct routine business 
during fiscal  we issued a note receivable in the approximate amount of million related to open accounts receivable balances for one customer 
the note bears interest at the rate of per annum and provides for eight monthly payments of approximately  additionally  we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
unless there is a question as to whether an account is collectible  the sales revenue and cost of goods sold are recognized upon agreement of terms and delivery has occurred 
on june   we obtained a million revolving loan agreement and credit line with first victoria national bank 
this line replaced and increased the expiring credit line of million with first victoria national bank 
the new facility has a two year term and bears interest at the prime rate 
the credit line allows the company to borrow funds to purchase equipment and is secured by the equipment purchased and any leases on that equipment 
interest on any outstanding principle balance is payable monthly  while the principal is due at the end of the two year term 
the revolving loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants that require  among other things  that the company maintain a debt to shareholder s equity ratio of a maximum of to  maintain a current assets to current liabilities ratio of a minimum of to  and not 
table of contents incur or maintain any indebtedness or obligations or guarantee the debts or obligations of others in a total aggregate amount which exceeds million without the prior written approval of first victoria national bank  except for indebtedness incurred as a result of the seamap acquisition and other specific exceptions 
we had not borrowed any funds available under this credit line as of january  in connection with the seamap acquisition  we issued million in promissory notes payable to the shareholders of seamap 
the notes are three year  notes with no principal or interest due in the first months 
interest on the full amount of the principal is due on the first anniversary of the notes in the amount of  no further interest or principal payments are due until the second anniversary of the notes 
at that time  interest on the full amount of the notes and or million of the principal amount of million is due 
on the third anniversary of the notes  interest on the unpaid principal and the remainder of the principal is due 
the terms of the purchase and sale agreement provide for additional earn out payments of million  subject to seamap achieving certain annual revenue thresholds of million and million over a five year period 
at the present time  we believe that cash on hand and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital and liquidity needs over the next months 
however  should demand warrant  we may pursue additional borrowings or other sources of capital

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and useful lives of our lease pool assets  useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and our impairment assessment of the lease pool and various intangible assets 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease until there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
commission income is recognized once it has been paid to us 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the lessee is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from the equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectibility 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically  as conditions warrant  based on whether such receivables are collectible 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance and do not recognize interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
long lived assets we carry property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from two to ten years 
cables are depreciated over years  geophones over years  channel boxes over a five year period and earth vibrators and other heavy equipment are depreciated over a ten year period 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life or the life of the leases 
intangible assets are amortized from to years 
seismic equipment held for lease consists primarily of recording channels and peripheral equipment and is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the equipment  which is five years for channel boxes and years for other peripheral equipment 
as this equipment is subject to technological obsolescence and wear and tear  no salvage value is assigned to it 

table of contents the estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on the company s experience as to the economic useful life of its products 
we review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment  including technological obsolescence  market demand and actual historical useful service life of our lease pool equipment 
additionally  to the extent information is publicly available  the company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness 
when we purchase new equipment for our lease pool  we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated  whether the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period 
our policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue  then the asset will remain on our books 
however if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity  then it is removed from our books 
in accordance with sfas  the company performs a review of its lease pool assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we typically review all major categories of assets not each individual asset in our consolidated lease pool with remaining net book value to ascertain whether or not we believe that a particular asset group will generate sufficient cash flow over their remaining life to recover the remaining carrying value of those assets 
assets that we believe will not generate cash flow sufficient to cover the remaining net book value are subject to impairment 
we make our assessments based on customer demand  current market trends and market value of our equipment to determine if it will be able to recover its remaining net book value from future leasing or sales 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the sale of dsi s operating assets 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the valuation of our seismic equipment lease pool 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
we intend to maintain the recorded valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of the tax valuation allowances 
in determining the valuation allowance  we considered the following positive indicators the current level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities resulting from historically high prices for oil and natural gas  increasing world demand for oil  our anticipated positive income in certain jurisdictions  and our existing customer relationships 
we also considered the following negative indicators the risk of the world oil supply increasing  thereby depressing the price of oil and natural gas  the risk of decreased global demand for oil  and the potential for increased competition in the seismic equipment leasing and sales business 
based on our evaluation of the evidence  we believe that it is appropriate to reduce our valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by million  leaving a valuation allowance 
table of contents on our books of million  which will give rise to a deferred tax asset of million at january  new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  revised share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation as amended sfas  and requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award usually the vesting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 

table of contents foreign currency risk we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
a foreign exchange contract is an arrangement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate 
foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the us dollar against foreign currencies and are included in other income in the statements of operations 
we recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the us dollar weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the us dollar strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
we recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the us dollar strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the us dollar weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at january  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within canada  australia  singapore and the united kingdom 
the subsidiaries in these countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in canadian  australian and singapore dollars and british pounds 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in canadian  australian and singapore dollars and british pounds  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars
