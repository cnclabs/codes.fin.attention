item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
overview pc connection is a national direct marketer of a wide range of it products and services including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications  and other products  and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers  distributors  and other suppliers 
we also offer a growing range of repair  configuration  installation  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium sized businesses  or smbs  through our pc connection sales subsidiaries  b large corporate accounts  or large account  through our moredirect subsidiary  and c federal  state  and local government and educational institutions  or public sector  through our govconnection subsidiary 
we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by account managers focused on the business  education  and government markets  ii our web sites  and iii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media 
the primary challenges we face in effectively managing our business are increasing our revenues while improving our gross profit margins in all three business segments  recruiting  retaining  and improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively managing and leveraging our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses over a higher sales base 
with only moderate growth projected in the overall it industry  any significant sales growth for us must come through increased market share 
competition is expected to be even more intense in the future  which could put more pressure on margins 
we enjoyed a modest improvement in sales productivity average annualized sales per sales representative in compared to the prior year and have made significant investments in our sales training programs and information systems in anticipation of further productivity gains in the latter half of we also launched in the fourth quarter of our core sales training program with the goal of improving sales representatives retention and productivity 
increasing our sales representatives productivity will remain a key corporate challenge for the upcoming year 
we also invested in our services business in in anticipation of migrating our business from a product centered to solution oriented model 
as previously reported  the general services administration  or gsa  cancelled its contract with govconnection in november  following its review of that subsidiary s contract management system and procedures and the possibility of the sale of unqualified items and underpayment of required fees 
although we were awarded a new gsa contract in august  we have experienced significant declines in our and federal government sales from levels 
our federal government revenues may continue to be negatively impacted as govconnection seeks to regain sales under the new gsa contract 
this matter is further discussed in the section entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses special charges income from operations our overall increase in net sales resulted from year over year sales growth achieved in all three business segments 
the year over year increases in our gross margin and sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales are attributable largely to the inclusion of additional vendor consideration amounts as reductions to cost of sales 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in our catalogs as well as other advertising promotions 
as noted in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we revised our estimates in the third quarter of relating to vendor consideration as a result of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
this pronouncement requires that such consideration be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales unless the consideration represents reimbursement for costs incurred for a specific advertising program funded by an individual vendor 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of additional advertising reimbursements in excess of advertising costs incurred as reductions to cost of sales and inventory 
we recorded million and million of these respective amounts as offsets to cost of sales  and the respective balances reduced inventory 
such excess advertising reimbursements had previously been recorded as offsets to sg a expense 
this revision resulted in increases  on a consolidated basis  of and in both gross margin and sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales for and  respectively 
sg a expenses also increased as a result of increased investments in related to our improvements to our sales systems and our service related business 
as a result of these investments  we expect to see increases in both retention and productivity in our sales representatives in the latter half of 
table of contents sales distribution the following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by business segment  sales channel  and product mix years ended december  business segment smb large account public sector total sales channel outbound telemarketing and field sales online internet inbound telesales total product mix notebooks and pdas desktop servers storage devices software net com products printers and printer supplies video  imaging  and sound memory and system enhancements accessories other total gross profit margins the following table summarizes our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  for the last three years years ended december  segment smb large account public sector total consolidated gross margin increased modestly year over year in due to the gross margin gain realized in our smb and public sector segments  as the large account segment experienced a slight year over year gross margin decline 
our increase in gross margin rate for the year ended december  was primarily the result of our revised estimates relating to eitf  as discussed previously 
specifically  on a segment basis for the year ended december   our revised estimates relating to eitf resulted in increases of and  respectively  in our smb and public sector gross margin rates 
we continue to focus on improving product margins by increasing add on sales of accessories and other companion products to system sales and by increasing sales of third party warranty  installation  and other services 
excluding the effect of eitf  gross margins decreased in primarily as the result of increased competitive pressures  as described more fully below 

table of contents we continue to focus on generating more gross profit dollars per transaction and on increasing gross margin 
our efforts to preserve and improve product margins include increasing our higher margin sales of third party warranty  installation  and other services  maximizing higher valued vendor incentive programs  and increasing sales productivity 
gross margin on sales to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts is generally lower than gross margins on consumer or smaller business sales 
gross margin on sales to public sector customers has historically been lower than that for commercial sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per public sector and large account order is generally higher as average order sizes are usually larger 
we believe that sales to large account and public sector customers will continue to represent a growing portion of our business mix in future periods 
we also expect the increasing migration of customers to our web sites to continue the increase in the percentage of online internet sales  which generally have higher margins 
gross margins also vary by product mix 
sales of notebooks and pdas accounted for of our overall sales in  a decrease from in the decrease in these two product lines served to increase our overall gross margin rates 
sales of computer systems including desktops  servers  and notebooks result in a relatively high dollar sales order and generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all our products 
however they usually yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
cost of sales and certain other costs cost of sales includes the invoice cost of the product  packaging  inbound and outbound freight  and provisions for inventory obsolescence  adjusted for discounts  rebates  and other vendor consideration adjustments  including those pursuant to eitf direct operating expenses relating to our purchasing function and receiving  inspection  internal transfer  warehousing  packing and shipping  and other expenses of our distribution center are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
accordingly  our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities who include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold 
such costs  as a percentage of net sales for the years reported  are as follows years ended december  operating expenses the following table breaks out our more significant operating expenses for the last three years in millions of dollars years ended december  personnel costs advertising  net facilities operations credit card fees depreciation and amortization bad debts other net total percentage of net sales 
table of contents we have concentrated our efforts on managing our overall operating costs 
while we plan to continue our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as enhancing our sales training  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation technology to support the sales organization 
personnel costs continue to represent the majority of our operating expenses  with sales personnel representing the largest portion of these costs 
our other operating costs  except for credit card fees and bad debts  tend to be relatively fixed over changing sales levels 
total operating expenses increased year over year in partly as a result of investments in our sales systems and our service related business  these included incremental expenditures related to training  customer acquisition programs  and other marketing initiatives 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in our catalogs as well as other advertising promotions 
eitf  which addresses the income classification of vendor consideration  became effective for the periods beginning january  this pronouncement requires that such consideration be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales unless the consideration represents reimbursement for costs incurred for a specific advertising program funded by an individual vendor 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded advertising expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  we received total vendor advertising funding of million  million  and million  respectively 
we recorded million  million  and million of these reimbursements as reductions to cost of sales and inventory in   and  respectively 
as discussed earlier  we revised our estimates used to determine excess vendor advertising in  and accordingly  million and million of the respective and amounts referred to above relates to this revision in our estimates 
our net advertising expense was accordingly higher in those two years 
although the level of vendor co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising support has remained consistent with our levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
we believe that the overall levels of co op advertising support available over the next twelve months will be consistent with our planned advertising programs 

table of contents year over year comparisons year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  million in from  million in as we experienced increases in all three business segments 
changes in net sales and gross profit by business segment are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales change sales smb large account public sector total gross profit smb large account public sector total net sales for our smb segment increased due to a modest increase in the number of sales representatives employed in while maintaining sales productivity 
sales representatives for the smb segment totaled at december   up from at december  net sales for our smb segment also increased due the implementation of customer acquisition initiatives  including increased internet advertising  which contributed to our year over year increase in smb internet sales in net sales for our large account segment increased due to an improvement in average sales productivity per account manager and as a result of our acquisition in october of certain assets of amherst technologies llc  or the amherst transaction 
our fourth quarter sales of included million of revenues generated by former amherst sales representatives who joined this segment 
sales representatives for the large account segment totaled at december   up from at the end of this segment s productivity increase resulted from increased penetration of our existing customer base  as well as the addition of new accounts 
net sales for our public sector segment increased due to a year over year increase in our federal government revenues  as our sales to state and local government units and educational organizations were level year over year 
during the year ended december   we added several new vendors to our gsa contract  which was awarded in the third quarter of and therefore not in effect for most of the prior year 
sales representatives for our public sector segment totaled at december  and gross profit increased in all three business segments as shown by the above  whereas the gross margin percentage of net sales improved for our smb and public sector segments 
gross profit for our smb segment increased primarily due to a refinement of estimates  made in the third quarter of  pursuant to eitf  which required the transfer of additional vendor consideration from sg a to cost of sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of additional vendor consideration as a reduction to cost of sales  compared to million in these offsets resulted in gross margin increases of and of net sales for and  respectively 
gross margins were otherwise negatively impacted by increased shipping costs and tighter competitive pricing pressures  which partly offset the increased vendor consideration 

table of contents gross profit for our large account segment increased due to an increase in sales as explained above 
gross margin rates decreased modestly in this highly competitive large enterprise segment 
we targeted a select group of high value customers in the latter half of  which partly accounted for the sales increase but also adversely impacted gross margin rates 
gross profit for our public sector segment increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales due primarily to our recording additional vendor consideration  pursuant to eitf  as a reduction to cost of sales in compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of additional vendor consideration as a reduction to cost of sales  compared to million in these offsets resulted in gross margin increases of and of net sales for and  respectively 
similar to smb  increased shipping costs and tighter competitive pricing pressures negatively impacted this segment s gross margin rates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales in from sg a expenses attributable to our operating segments are summarized below dollars in millions years ended december  change amount of net sales amount of net sales smb large account public sector total sg a expenses for our smb segment increased year over year  and were higher as a percentage of net sales in compared to  primarily due to an increase in net advertising expense 
net advertising expense increased as a result of the previously discussed change in estimates for vendor consideration as well as increased internet advertising costs 
our investments in making our sales support systems more responsive and flexible also contributed to this segment s sg a expenses 
sg a expenses for our large account segment increased year over year  but remained flat as a percentage of net sales in compared to the prior year 
the dollar increase resulted partly from the additional sales representatives added from our amherst transaction 
sg a expenses for this segment represent the lowest of the three segments as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the nature and efficiency of this segment s variable cost field sales and drop shipping operating model 
sg a expenses for our public sector segment increased year over year  and were higher as a percentage of net sales in compared to net advertising expense increased as a result of the previously discussed change in estimates for vendor consideration 
this segment s sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales also continue to be higher than its historical trend due to our retention of experienced federal sales personnel while we continue to rebuild our federal business 
see factors that may affect future results and financial condition for further discussion of this topic 
our investments in making our sales support systems more responsive and flexible also contributed to this segment s sg a expenses 

table of contents special charges totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a roll forward of special charges for the two years ended december  is shown below in thousands of dollars 
there were no significant changes in estimates in any of the periods presented 
workforce reductions amherst transaction employee defalcation gsa review other total balance december  charges cash payments balance december  charges cash payments adjustments balance december  the amherst transaction charges relate primarily to the temporary retention of certain amherst employees and facilities while we integrated this business 
the charges for the employee defalcation represent the loss sustained by one of our commercial subsidiaries in excess of the amount covered by insurance 
the charges for the gsa contract review represent costs of our review relating to the cancellation by the gsa in late of its contract with our subsidiary  govconnection  and costs related to securing a new gsa schedule  which was awarded in august the other charges in include accrued as an estimated liability in a patent infringement case  which we settled in  and in professional fees relating to our review of certain calendar year and transactions 
income from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million compared to moredirect  our large account segment  accounted for million and million of our income from operations in and  respectively 
excluding moredirect  we incurred a loss from operations of million for and million for  primarily as the result of the losses incurred in our public sector segment and the lower gross margin in our smb segment  after excluding the effect of eitf income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to the changes in net sales  gross margin  and sg a expenses as discussed above 
interest expense was million in both and interest expense was unchanged in as higher interest rates in were offset by lower borrowings as compared to our effective tax rate was for and for this year over year increase was due primarily to the tax benefits of state tax loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions not recognizable as offsets to state tax charges in other jurisdictions  and to certain non deductible expenses 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately in due to anticipated changes in mix of state income taxes to which we are subject 
net income decreased by million to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in income from operations 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  million in from  million in our smb and large account segments both increased  offsetting the decrease in our public sector s sales 
changes in net sales and gross profit by business segment are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales change sales smb large account public sector total gross profit smb large account public sector total net sales for our smb segment increased due to the increase in the number of sales account managers employed in while maintaining sales productivity 
sales representatives for the smb segment totaled at december   up from at december  sales productivity was flat in compared to because we implemented company wide gross margin improvement initiatives in early as discussed below  these initiatives inhibited our sales growth as we refrained from low margin sales but resulted in improved over all operating margins 
net sales for our large account segment increased due to an improvement in average sales productivity per account manager 
it spending grew at a faster pace for our large fortune customers than those of our other two business segments 
sales account managers for the large account segment totaled at december   down from at the end of this reduction in headcount resulted from a planned reduction in under performing sales representatives 
net sales for our public sector segment decreased due primarily to a decrease in sales to the federal government 
our federal government sales decreased from the prior year due to the late cancellation of our gsa contract described previously 
although we were issued a new gsa contract in august  it was too late into the federal buying season to recover this business 
however  sales to state and local governmental and educational institutions sled increased due to improvement in average sales productivity per account manager 
sales account managers for the public sector segment totaled at december   up from at december  the headcount mix between our federal and sled account managers was unchanged from year to year due to our investment decision to maintain our federal account managers despite the nine month absence of our gsa contract 
gross profit increased in our smb and large account areas as shown by the above  whereas the gross margin percentage of net sales improved for our smb and public sector segments 
gross profit for the smb segment improved due to increases in both net sales and gross margin rate 
we were able to improve gross margin rates by increasing add on sales of accessories and other companion products to our system sales  as well increasing sales of third party warranty  installation  and other services 
these initiatives were implemented in both our smb and public sector segments in early additionally  
table of contents as discussed earlier  our revised estimates of advertising reimbursements in excess of costs incurred accounted for basis points of our increase in gross margin rate in the smb segment 
gross profit for the large account segment increased due to the increase in sales explained earlier  despite a decrease in the gross margin rate 
changes in customer mix and continuing competitive pressures caused gross margin rates to decrease on a year over year basis 
despite an increase in gross margin rate  gross profit for the public sector segment decreased due to the decline in federal sales discussed above 
similar to our smb segment  we were able to improve margin rates by increasing add on sales of accessories and other companion products to our system sales  as well as increasing sales of third party warranty  installation  and other services 
as a result of losing its gsa contract in late  the public sector increased its agency revenues from sales through third party gsa schedules in  which contributed to its improved gross margin rate 
revising our estimates used in eitf led to an impact of less than on this segment s gross margin rate 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales in from we have concentrated our efforts on managing our overall operating costs 
personnel costs generally account for approximately two thirds of our sg a expenses  as shown earlier in the table of sg a expenses 
while we plan to continue our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as hiring more experienced outbound sales account managers  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation technology to support the sales organization 
sg a expenses attributable to our operating segments are summarized below dollars in millions year ended december  change amount of net sales amount of net sales smb large account public sector total sg a expenses for the smb segment increased slightly in  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales from this segment has a relatively fixed cost structure  and the increase in its net sales resulted in a lower expense rate for this year 
as discussed earlier  in we revised our estimates relating to vendor consideration as a result of eitf and reclassified in our smb segment million of advertising reimbursements in excess of advertising costs from sg a expense to cost of goods sold and inventory 
the resulting net increase in advertising expenses was the primary reason for our increased expense on a dollar basis but was partially offset by decreases in depreciation expense and bad debt expense 
sg a expenses for the large account segment increased on a dollar basis but decreased as a percentage of net sales 
sg a expenses for this segment represent the lowest of the three segments as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the nature and efficiency of this segment s variable cost field sales and drop shipping operating model 
the public sector segment s sg a expenses increased in but were significantly higher as a percentage of net sales from the significant decrease in our federal sales described above accounted for the increase in this segment s sg a expense as a percentage of sales 
we retained our experienced sales personnel in anticipation of our new gsa contract  which was awarded in august

we concluded our review of these transactions in october income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million compared to moredirect  our large account segment  accounted for million and million of our income from operations in and  respectively 
excluding moredirect  we incurred a loss from operations of million for and million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in this increase was attributable to the changes in net sales  gross margin  and sg a expenses as discussed above 
interest expense was million in and million in interest expense increased due to slightly higher average borrowings outstanding and slightly higher interest rates in as compared to our effective tax rate was for and for this year over year decrease was due to a decrease in our accrual for state tax contingencies in certain states in which we operate 
net income increased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the increase in income from operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  and recently the amherst transaction 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit and inventory trade credit agreements  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures of to million and payments on capital and operating lease obligations of approximately million 
we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  additional borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december  we had approximately million in unrestricted accounts 

table of contents cash generated from operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and balancing net changes in inventories and receivables with compensating changes in payables to generate a positive cash flow 
historically  we have consistently generated positive cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
as of december   we had drawn million of our million bank line of credit 
this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for information technology products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
see also related risks listed below under factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
summary sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the last three years in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities decreased in but increased in the primary reasons for the decrease in were a decrease in net earnings before depreciation and an increase in receivables  partially offset by an increase in payables 
the increase in resulted primarily from an increase in net earnings before depreciation and a decrease in receivables  partially offset by a decrease in payables 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under inventory trade credit agreements we use to finance our purchase of certain inventory  secured by the inventory so financed 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities increased significantly in these activities include our capital expenditures in the three years presented  primarily for computer equipment and capitalization of internally developed software 
our acquisition of moredirect required earn out payments due to the former shareholder of moredirect 
these payments totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  in october we consummated the amherst transaction  which accounted for million of the use of cash in cash provided by financing activities in related to an increase in our net borrowings of million under our bank line of credit  whereas there was a decrease in our net borrowings by million in our financing activities consisted primarily of an increase in net borrowings of million 

table of contents debt instruments  contractual agreements  and related covenants below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities and other contractual obligations 
it is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements  which are on file with the securities and exchange commission 
for more information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and inventory financing agreements  see factors affecting sources of liquidity 
for more information about our obligations  commitments  and contingencies  see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
bank line of credit 
we secured from our current bank an increased line of credit in june to provide us with a borrowing capacity of up to million 
in addition  we have the option to increase the facility an additional million  based on sufficient levels of trade receivables to meet borrowing base requirements  and depending on meeting minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and equity requirements  described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
amounts outstanding under this facility were million at december  approximately million of this amount bear interest at eurodollar rates million at and million at 
the balance bears interest at the prime rate at december  
substantially all of our assets are collateralized as security for this facility  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
borrowing availability under the line was million at december  this facility  which matures in june  operates under an automatic cash management program whereby disbursements in excess of available cash are added as borrowings at the time disbursement checks clear the bank  and available cash receipts are first applied against any outstanding borrowings and then invested in short term qualified cash investments 
accordingly  borrowings under the line are classified as current 
inventory trade credit agreements 
we have security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for up to financing on the purchase price  up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase their products 
amounts outstanding under such facilities  equal to million as of december   are recorded in accounts payable  and the inventory financed is classified as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total including interest  excluding taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
capital leases 
we have a year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership 
we also have a three year lease for certain computer equipment with an unrelated 
table of contents party 
we are required to make lease payments aggregating from million to million per year 
in addition to the rent payable under the facility lease  we are required to pay real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see contractual obligations above for lease commitments under these leases 
earn out provisions of moredirect merger agreement 
we completed the acquisition of moredirect in april under the terms of this agreement  we were required to make additional payments to the moredirect shareholder if certain earnings levels were achieved through december  earn out payments aggregating million  million  and million were made in   and  respectively  based on moredirect s   and earnings  respectively 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  stock repurchases  dividends and other distributions  investments  and liens with which the company and all of its subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit  but would also constitute a default 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated ebitda for the four quarters must not be more than to our actual funded debt ratio at december  was to minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter  beginning with the quarter ending march  loss quarters not counted 
our actual consolidated stockholders equity at december  was million 
the borrowing base under this facility is set at of qualified commercial receivables  plus of qualified government receivables  less million of the formula availability which must be held in reserves 
as of december   million of the facility was available for additional borrowings 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec requires that all registrants disclose their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires 
table of contents management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
we have reviewed our policies for the year ended december  and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring to the customer at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on significant historical experience 
should such returns no longer prove estimable  we believe that the impact on our financials would not necessarily be significant  since the return privilege expires days after shipment 
revenue for third party service contracts are recorded on a net sales recognition basis because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in these transactions 
for such contracts  we evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales as required under the guidelines described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor  and the entire selling process is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider recorded as a cost of sales 
under net sales recognition  we are not the primary obligor  and the cost to the third party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales  with no cost of goods sold  thus leaving the entire gross profit as the reported net sale for the transaction 
similarly  we recognize revenue from agency sales transactions on a net sales basis 
in agency sales transactions  we facilitate product sales by equipment manufacturers directly to our customers and receive agency fees for such transactions 
we do not take title to the products or assume any maintenance or return obligations in these transactions  title is passed directly from the supplier to our customer 
net amounts included in revenue for such service contracts and agency sales transactions were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current credit worthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 

table of contents in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur future charges to our income statement 
vendor consideration we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for price protections  discounts  product rebates  and other programs 
these allowances are treated as a reduction of the vendor s prices and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory  as applicable 
we also receive vendor co op advertising funding for our catalogs and other programs 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of the underlying specific  incremental  and identifiable costs  are offset against selling  general  and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of income 
advertising reimbursements that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are recorded as reductions to cost of inventory purchases in accordance with eitf the level of allowances received from certain merchandise vendors has declined in past years and may do so again 
such a decline could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems  peripheral equipment  and consumer electronics are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non salable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
this could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have historically ranged between million and million per annum 
historically  there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
contingencies from time to time we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in  we were subject to audit by the gsa 
while we have accrued an estimate of our anticipated liability in the financial statements  such estimate is subject to change based on incremental findings by the government auditors 
any such change in estimate will impact both our results of operations and our cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we may review the 
table of contents carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
over the last several years  we have incurred no impairment charges 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially effect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits our employee compensation model has several elements that we consider variable 
these include our obligation to our employees for health care 
we have selected a plan that results in our being self insured up to certain stop loss limits 
accordingly  we have to estimate the amount of health care claims outstanding at a given point in time 
these estimates are based on historical experience and could be subject to change 
such change could negatively impact both our earnings and our cash flows 
we also have granted stock options to our employees 
in general  such grants since have been made at the current fair value of our stock and accordingly  given that we account for option awards under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  no compensation charge has been recorded 
in previous years  most specifically those years prior to our initial public offering  there was a difference between the strike price of the option and the then current fair value of the stock 
this difference resulted in a fixed and determinable compensation charge 
in december  we accelerated the vesting of certain stock options 
this acceleration was undertaken to minimize recognition of compensation expense in future years in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r in  as discussed below 
see note stockholders equity of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we did not  however  modify option grants in a manner that would cause either re measurement of the awards or the commencement of variable accounting 
as described in the notes to the financial statements  pro forma disclosure has been provided as if we applied the fair value methodology to option awards 
the recognition of compensation for awards  as will be required upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas r for our interim quarter ending march   will have an adverse effect on our earnings 
for the years through  we expect to record million  million  million  and million  respectively  for the remaining unvested options held by officers from grants greater than  shares 
we have also engaged in workforce reduction actions in each of the last three years 
these actions included formula driven termination benefits 
these benefits were or are being paid relatively quickly and have not been subject to change 
we do not foresee a circumstance where there could be significant variability in our workforce reduction estimates 
however  if we did experience significant variability  such change could negatively impact our cash flows 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires a company to measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees in exchange for services and recognize that cost over the period that such services are performed 
sfas r is effective for the beginning of the first fiscal year after june  and will be effective for our interim quarter ending march  sfas r allows the choice between two methods of adoption the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
adoption of sfas r may materially increase stock compensation expense and decrease net income 
in addition  sfas r requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a cash inflow 
table of contents from financing activities rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective approach 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of accounting changes by requiring retrospective application to prior period financial statements unless impracticable 
this statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after december  inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we had million in borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
however  as noted above  million in borrowings were outstanding on the credit agreement at december   and the average outstanding borrowings during the year were million 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates is not material
