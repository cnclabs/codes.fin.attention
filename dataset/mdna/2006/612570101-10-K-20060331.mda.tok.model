item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey gourmet foods was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of gourmet refrigerated food products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  the caribbean  latin america and asia pacific 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey gourmet foods brands by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  stores by december  during recent years the company added retail and club distribution through internal growth and through the frescala foods  nate s  emerald valley  cibo  sonoma cheese  and casual gourmet acquisitions 
in  the company s shareholders approved the change of the name of the company to monterey gourmet foods  inc the name change was made to define the company s strategic direction more accurately 
the name change also announces to the investor community  our customers and consumers  our strategic direction to become a complete supplier of gourmet refrigerated foods 
in the company launched two new product lines outside its core pasta sauce business  including gourmet refrigerated entrees  such as seafood lasagna and pasta primavera  and grilled wrap sandwiches  featuring a garlic chicken wrap and a chicken ranchero burrito 
additional distribution was obtained in when the company introduced low carbohydrate pastas and sauces 
also in  the company acquired cibo naturals january   a maker of sauces  dips and spreads 
in the company launched new products such as chicken penne gratin  chicken and mozzarella ravioli  and pork and chicken tamales 
additionally the company was able to increase distribution by introducing whole wheat pastas which are higher in dietary fiber  have a favorable glycemic index  and are made from whole grains 
in the company acquired two additional companies 
casual gourmet foods  inc january is a marketer of flavorful low fat  low calorie chicken sausages  chicken burgers and soups  and sonoma foods  inc april is a producer of an outstanding line of refrigerated specialty cheese products that features its flagship line of sonoma jack cheeses 
sonoma cheese has earned numerous awards over the years for its traditional and flavored jack cheeses 
monterey gourmet foods believes that the convenient gourmet food segment is growing rapidly as time starved consumers seek high quality quick meal solutions and the company  with its staff of senior chefs and its flexible manufacturing facilities  is well positioned to bring new products to these consumers 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on several key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  whether the company can continue to introduce new products that meet consumer acceptance  whether the company  by diversifying into other complementary businesses through new product offerings or acquisitions can leverage its strengths and continue to grow revenues at levels attractive to its investors  whether the newly acquired acquisitions perform as planned when purchased  and whether the company can maintain and increase the number of items it is selling to its two largest customers 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
during  costco chose to reduce the number of items it carries  which caused a reduction of sales from the company to costco 
in late  sam s club began an sku stock keeping unit reduction project which has impacted the company s sales in the company believes that access to capital resources and increasing sales to offset higher fixed overhead  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company continues to develop new products for consumers and revise advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred several exceptional costs 
these costs included a disruption in product flow through a major customer s warehouse which caused out of code issues on one product  a limited voluntary product withdrawal resulting from a quality issue on a secondary out sourced private label product  and costs associated with the rapid start up and introduction of a major new product line with our largest customer 
this new product performed well in the fourth quarter  however  significant extra costs and inefficiencies with this product were incurred in the fourth quarter from the rapid scale up in production necessitated by this customer s volume demands 
operations for  and net revenues were as follows years ended net revenues    percent change in net revenues from prior year on june   the board of directors approved a resolution to change the fiscal year of the company to a calendar year 
prior to this change the company employed a week  week  week reporting period with the fiscal year ending on the last sunday of each calendar year week year 
the fiscal year ended on december  and the fiscal year would have ended on december  the change was made primarily to accommodate the consolidation process of newly acquired subsidiaries 

the company recorded sales of million between december  and december  the increase compared to is due to the additional volume generated from the acquisitions of cibo  emerald valley  casual gourmet foods  and sonoma foods some of which had sales in the previous year 
excluding sales generated from these four acquisitions  net sales increased 
again excluding sales generated from these four acquisitions  sales to costco increased compared to  however  sales to sam s club declined in compared to the company s monterey pasta brand retail business  excluding the sales to the club stores  which has been a focus for the company  was up when compared to the previous year and was up in the second half of when compared to the second half of the success of the company s new whole wheat pastas is helping fuel this growth 
the change in net revenues is mostly a result of changes in volume sold and only a small portion is a result of price changes for the company s products 
in addition  casual gourmet  the specialty poultry sausage and soup marketer acquired in january  experienced several set backs of product distribution and sales with its two largest customers during the fourth quarter 
in both cases  losses were related to the customer s change in merchandising strategy and increased competition within the poultry sausage category 
casual gourmet management has responded quickly with innovative new products  including products in the much larger pork sausage category 
casual expects to begin regaining several product placements with key club customers during the first quarter of additionally  casual gourmet has developed a line of no nitrite chicken sausages targeted at the retail supermarket channel 
the company also increased the distribution of its products and spent limited amounts for slotting new skus in the retail supermarket channel 
as a result  the company saw slotting dollars increase in compared to in  the company announced that approximately  wal mart supercenters discontinued its private label refrigerated pasta and pasta sauce program which the company was making since the company does not sell any other products to wal mart supercenters 
wal mart supercenter s private label business represented   and of net sales in  and  respectively 
additionally  popular diet trends in the united states impacted the overall consumption of pasta which negatively impacted sales 
sales to costco continued to be impacted by costco s sku reduction and also from competitor inroads 
sales to costco were million in during  monterey pasta branded retail sales of pasta items grew by in spite of a decline in the overall pasta category  reflecting on the company s increased focus on this distribution channel 
the company has embarked upon a diversification strategy which included the acquisition in of emerald valley kitchens in of cibo naturals  llc  and in casual gourmet foods and sonoma foods 
the table below shows the percent of net revenues these four acquisitions have represented years ended percent of net revenues from recent acquisitions all other net revenues total gross profit and gross margin were as follows years ended gross profit    gross margin percent the gross margin improvement of  compared with was a function of higher sales  higher production volume through the company s currently operating plants  reduced fixed costs  and reduced labor costs 
gross margin percent improvement compared to prior year is a function of cost savings from higher plant volume  lower fixed costs  and also an improvement in product mix especially from recent acquisitions  offset by higher utility and rent costs 
management has continued to reorganize and reduce its workforce in salinas  where the number of employees has been reduced by approximately since in  the gross margin declined compared to the decline was a result of higher raw material costs which the company was not fully able to pass along to its customers  a decline in pasta sales of which increased fixed costs as a percent of sales  higher workers compensation costs  and new product introductions start up costs  including label development  usda approvals  and product development costs 
as a consequence of lower pasta sales and raw material higher costs  in  management reorganized its production and plant overhead workforce which reduced the number of employees at the company by approximately 
since that time additional reduction in workforce both in the plant and in general overhead has taken place 
currently  the company has reduced its california work force by compared to the same time in other initiatives that have been implemented have reduced the company s packaging costs  offset increased freight costs  lowered general and administrative costs  and minimized the impact of higher raw material costs 
these projects were done in an effort to reduce processing costs and increase margins 
the impact of these changes on the company s gross profit is difficult to quantify because of its sensitivity to volume through the plant 
the company charged to costs or expense   and  in   and respectively  of obsolete packaging inventory 
in addition  the rapid rollout of new packaging in to the company s second largest club store customer  where the customer chose to deplete from its shelves the inventory of the old packaging before ordering product in the new packaging  caused expenses to exceed expectations 
this caused a dramatic slowdown in production followed by rapid increase in production  causing high expenditures all of which contributed to the decline in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were as follows years ended sg a expense    sg a expense as a percent of net revenues sg a as a percent of net revenues decreased for compared to as illustrated in the above table 
during  the company introduced many new products including one step gourmet frozen entrees  additional whole wheat pastas  new flavors of dips and new refrigerated entrees 
the company spent incrementally higher promotional dollars in order to introduce these new products 
the company spent more in targeted promotional costs in sam s club and costco in compared to the company also has spent  with consultants plus a significant amount of internal resources documenting its internal controls in its efforts to become compliant with sarbanes oxley section also the company has seen its audit and audit related fees increase in compared to the same period in amortization associated with the acquisitions increased when comparing to the company is also consolidating its sales force  distribution system and warehousing following its most recent acquisitions 
these cost reductions are partially offset by increased freight cost due to fuel surcharges and also by adding the sg a costs associated with casual gourmet s and sonoma foods overhead 
demonstration costs paid to outside vendors were  and of net revenues for the years   and  respectively 
the increases in compared to were related to increased marketing costs related to the introduction of new products  increased freight costs due to fuel surcharges and reduced volume on each truck due to reduced club sales and the addition of expenses associated with operating the cibo business 
these increases were offset by the elimination of approximately employee positions 
depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and sg a  increased to  or of net revenues  compared to  or of net revenues in and  or of net revenues in the increases over the past two years relate to the recent acquisitions and to capacity expansion and equipment upgrades in the salinas  california  seattle  washington and eugene  oregon production facilities 
amortization of intangible assets as a result of acquisitions was  in compared to  in  and  in see liquidity  capital resources and business acquisitions  page net interest expense for was  compared to net interest expense of  in and interest income of  in the interest expense in and is attributable to the bank loans needed for the cibo naturals  casual gourmet foods and sonoma foods acquisitions and the subordinated debt remaining on the cibo naturals balance sheet 
the interest income was generated from investment in short term money funds from operating cash flow in the absence of bank debt 
income tax benefit expense for  and was   and  respectively 
the income tax benefit of  was of pretax loss 
income taxes for reflect a deferred tax credit of  or of pretax loss 
the tax expense was  or of pre tax income 
the higher than expected income tax rate in is due to manufacturing tax credits and other permanent book and tax differences 
the company has recorded deferred tax assets partly because of net operating losses that can offset future taxable income 
management has concluded that it s more likely than not that these nols would be fully utilized and will offset future taxable income 
this benefit  together with permanent differences and other current tax effects resulted in a net income tax benefit of  additionally  the company realized additional tax benefits as a result of the exercise of non qualified stock options and the exercise and subsequent sale of certain incentive stock options or disqualifying dispositions in  and for financial reporting purposes  any resulting reduction in actual income tax obligations as a result of these disqualifying dispositions is credited to additional paid in capital

net accounts receivable and inventory  adjusted for receivables and inventory purchased as a result of the acquisitions increased  and  respectively when comparing balances with balances 
the increase in net accounts receivable and the increase in inventory  which strained working capital at year end is a direct result of the increase in net revenues for december net revenues for december were million compared to million in december  a increase 
accounts receivable  net of allowances increased only due to the fact that the company s aged receivables expressed in days outstanding decreased from days in to days in inventory increased  which is similar to the revenue growth 
the company s inventory turnover expressed in days was days for compared to days for  thus inventory increased at the same rate as revenues 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and the company s line of credit 
the company finances its operations and growth primarily with cash flows generated from operations 
the company has a million working capital line of credit which was fully utilized as of december  and no additional line of credit was available to the company at december   a letter of credit in the amount of  which is issued in favor of an insurance company to support a self funded worker s compensation program  which was increased to  in january  and non revolving term loans from the bank to fund acquisitions 
no additional revolving term loan is available to the company without bank approval 
the company also had a bank overdraft of  the company borrowed  under a non revolving term loan in to partially fund the cibo acquisition  the company borrowed an additional million in to partially fund the casual gourmet acquisition and on april  the company borrowed million to partially fund the sonoma foods acquisition 
the outstanding principal balance on the non revolving term loan was  as of december  the working capital commitment in place at december  expires october   however  subsequent to year end  the company negotiated an increase to its operating line of credit because of its need to provide additional working capital which is being required because of the recent sales growth which the company expects to continue 
the new line of credit allows for advances up to million based on a formula calculated on accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the interest rate on this entire credit line will be calculated at the bank s prime lending rate or libor plus which ever the company chooses 
the maturity date of the line of credit has been extended to march  and the covenants have been adjustment to accommodate the additional borrowing 
the company was also out of compliance with its debt coverage ratio covenant with its current bank as of december   and has obtained a waiver 
some product lines such as specialty cheeses require more working capital than other products 
cheese requires a certain amount of time to age before it can be sold 
other products such as the gourmet sausages are produced when orders are received and then shipped directly to customers 
working capital requirements for the company are being adjusted to reflect the growth of each product line 
the company believes that its existing credit facilities  along with the increased credit facility  and cash flows from operations  are sufficient to meet its cash needs for normal operations including all anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
in addition to operating cash flows  the company also received cash proceeds of   and  from the exercise of employee stock options and sales of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan during   and  respectively

many other smaller projects were completed to support growth  improve processes  support administrative systems  or assist in compliance issues 
the company anticipates capital expenditures to be approximately million which is about what was spent in all future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a combination of cash flow from operations or the use of the company s line of credit 
management believes that cash on hand at december   projected cash flows from operations  and the increase in its operating line of credit will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  expected company growth  and anticipated capital expenditures during alternative financing arrangements will need to be found if the company makes further acquisitions

critical accounting policies and management judgments the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements included in item the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable and allowances  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  inventory valuation  workers compensation reserves and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements business combinations the consolidated financial statements include the company s accounts and the accounts of wholly and majority owned subsidiaries 
the company consolidates all of the majority owned subsidiaries and reflects minority interest on the consolidated balance sheet of sonoma foods because of the uncertainty that monterey will purchase the remaining shares from the minority shareholders 
no minority interest has been recorded for the acquisitions of cibo and casual because the purchase of the remaining shares is mandated by the purchase agreements over the next several years at a price derived from a predetermined calculation 
monterey is the sole source of any financing needed by its majority owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  for the cibo and casual acquisitions  purchase accounting reflects the transaction as if monterey purchased of the entities 
no liability has been established for the remaining payments to their shareholders because the liability is not quantifiable 
when monterey pays for the remaining shares of cibo and casual  the company s goodwill will increase by the corresponding amount of the payment 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
in accordance with business combination accounting  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer lists  recipes and processes  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about growth rates  gross margins  market penetration  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
for business combinations  the company must record deferred taxes relating to the book versus tax basis differences of acquired assets and liabilities 
generally  such business combinations result in deferred tax liabilities as the book values are reflected at fair value whereas the tax basis is carried over from the acquired company 
such deferred taxes are initially estimated based on preliminary information and are subject to change as valuations and tax returns are finalized 
accounts receivable and allowances the company provides allowances for estimated credit losses  product returns  spoilage  and adjustments at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowances are based on reviews of the history of losses  returns  spoilage  contractual relationships with customers  current economic conditions  and other factors which warrant consideration in estimating potential losses 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts  notes  and other receivables is also dependent on future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
income taxes the company accounts for corporate income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach 
this approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance to the extent of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the company s deferred tax assets include significant amounts of net operating losses nols 
during  the valuation allowance was decreased due to the consideration of the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from acquisitions which affected the company s assessment of the realization of such nols 
the amount of the valuation allowance is significantly dependant on management s assumptions regarding future taxable income and the availability of these nols to offset future taxable income 
the effect on the company s net income is significant whenever the estimate changes 
the company expects to utilize all of the nols in future years 
for business combinations  the company must record deferred taxes relating to the book versus tax basis differences of acquired assets and liabilities 
generally  such business combinations result in deferred tax liabilities as the book values are reflected at fair value whereas the tax basis is carried over from the acquired company 
such deferred taxes are initially estimated based on preliminary information and are subject to change as valuations and tax returns are finalized 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market and consist principally of component ingredients to the company s refrigerated pasta and sauces  finished goods  and packaging materials 
many of the ingredients used in the company s products have a short shelf life and if not used in a certain amount of time may spoil 
management estimates that the raw material will be used in a timely manner  however  management has established certain reserves for the potential of inventory obsolescence  especially for slow moving inventory 
as of december   the company reduced the carrying value of its inventory by  this write down was made to cover certain refrigerated raw material inventory that is nearing its shelf life  certain packaging labels for products that may be rotated out of the club store accounts and for products that have already been rotated out of the club store accounts that may or may not be rotated back into the club store accounts 
the allowance is established based on management s estimate of alternative usage or salvage value of obsolete inventory 
management believes its estimates for spoiled and obsolete inventory is adequate given the current volume of business to its current customers 
workers compensation reserve the company s california and oregon locations entered into a partially self insured worker s compensation program for fiscal year and have continued the program into this program features a fixed annual payment  with a deductible on a per occurrence basis 
the annual expense consists of a base fee paid to an insurance company to administer the program  direct cash expenses to pay for injuries  an estimate for potential injuries that may have occurred but have not been reported  an estimate by the insurance company of costs to close out each injury and an estimate for injury development 
the company has been on this partially self insured program for just over three years and therefore has limited history of claim resolution available to support the company s projected liabilities 
therefore the company is using published industry actuarial data from an insurance carrier and reviewing each claim individually to determine the amount of reserves that should be established 
management believes that its current safety program and its safety record will provide the foundation to enable the company to realize the premium savings partially self insured programs are designed to achieve  however  estimated reserves may vary from future cash outlays 
the remaining locations are on a fixed premium insurance contract that covers all costs including claims 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues through sales of its products primarily to grocery and club store chains 
revenues are recognized once there is evidence of an arrangement such as a customer purchase order  product has been shipped to the customer or when the product has been delivered to the customer  the price and terms are fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  sales are recorded when goods are shipped or delivered  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  consistent with the freight terms for most customers 
potential returns  adjustments and spoilage allowances are considered as a reduction in revenues and are provided for in accounts receivable allowances and accruals 
all pricing is quoted fob shipping point to customers with freight included in the price for the convenience of the customer the company records its shipping cost for product delivered to customers in selling general and administrative expense 
any amounts charged to customers for freight and deliveries are included in revenues 
certain incentives granted to customers such as promotions  trade ads  slotting fees  terms discounts  and coupons are recorded as offsets to revenues 
goodwill intangible assets under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company s reporting units are trademarks  tradenames and customer relationships acquired in business acquisitions 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the reporting unit is based upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  and future cash flows 
as of december   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million 
the company defines a reporting unit as a unit one level below its operating segment 
a reporting unit exists if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and senior managers regularly review the operating results of the component 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least as often as annually and as triggering events may occur 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then a second step of goodwill impairment is performed to measure the impairment loss  if any 
in making an assessment  management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at the relevant point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic assessments of impairment 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its books 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least as often as annually and as triggering events may occur 
the company performs its annual review in the fourth quarter of each year 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at the relevant point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment may occur in the future 
in the fourth quarter  casual gourmet saw a significant reduction in its sales to its two largest customers 
if revenues to these two customers do not return to historical levels  the company may need to impair the goodwill and or intangible assets that have previously been recorded 
the company has taken many steps to restore the sales to these two major customers 
the company is introducing among other items anti biotic all white meat chicken sausages  nitrite free chicken sausages  sausages made with organic chicken  flavored pork sausages  and other products that fit under the casual gourmet label

recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes in interim financial statements  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and represents another step in the fasb s goal to converge its standards with those issued by the iasb 
among other changes  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements in the future 
as of december  this pronouncement had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first fiscal year beginning after june   which is the first quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but the modified retrospective method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
the lattice model uses assumptions  based upon actual historical data  about employee exercise behavior and expected changes in stock price volatility which can result in more accurate and often lower estimates of option value and expense 
the company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding the company s outstanding options 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the company is required to adopt sfas r effective january  the company believes that the amount the company will expense in future years is approximately reflected in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item in november  the fasb issued sfas no

except as disclosed below  all sales  operating items and balance sheet data are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the ordinary course of its business the company enters into commitments to purchase raw materials over a period of time  generally six months to one year  at contracted prices 
at december   management does not believe these future commitments were not at prices in excess of current market  or in quantities in excess of normal requirements 
the company does not utilize derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company invests excess cash in variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents 
the magnitude of the interest income generated by these cash equivalents is affected by market interest rates 
management does not use marketable securities or derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the interest payable on the company s bank line of credit and other long term liabilities are based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
short term interest rates have increased over the last two years 
the average interest rate the company is paying is 
rising interest rates have impacted interest expense 
if interest rates continue to rise  they will further depress the company s earnings 
currency risk during  the company sold  of product in currency other than us dollars 
these sales have terms of net days from shipment 
the company believes that its currency exposure is not material and has chosen not to hedge these sales
