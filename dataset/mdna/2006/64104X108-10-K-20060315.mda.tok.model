this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings disclosure statement and risk factors 
overview we are a global provider of information technology  or it  services and end to end business solutions designed to help clients improve their competitiveness and effectiveness 
end to end business solutions encompass all stages of a client s business process and incorporate all technologies and it services related to that process 
our portfolio of solutions and services includes outsourcing  system integration and application development  software and consulting  and quality assurance and training 
the primary industries  or verticals  we serve include government and defense  financial services  life sciences and healthcare  telecommunications and utilities  and independent software vendors  or isvs 
we have operations in countries across north america  europe and asia 
we combine our deep vertical expertise and strong technical capabilities to provide a complete range of high quality services on a global scale 
by integrating our local and international personnel in focused business and project teams  this global delivery model leverages our corporate knowledge and experience  intellectual property and global infrastructure to develop innovative solutions for clients across the geographies and verticals we serve 
we complement this global delivery model with our offshore delivery capabilities to achieve meaningful cost reductions or other benefits for our clients 
our revenues increased to million for  from million for net income increased to million for  from million for our revenue growth is attributable to a number of factors  including acquisitions we made  increases in the number and size of projects for existing clients  and the addition of new clients 
our client base is diverse  and we are not dependent on any single client 
in  no client accounted for more than of our revenues and our largest twenty clients together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for  the percentage of our revenues generated by public and private clients in israel was  and the percentage of our revenues derived  in aggregate  from agencies of the government of israel was 
existing clients from prior years generated more than of our revenues in our backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this million increase in our backlog was due primarily to new bookings 
we achieve backlog through new signings of it services projects and outsourcing contracts  including for new and repeat customers 
we recognize backlog as revenue when we perform the services related to backlog 
for  the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations was insignificant 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  it professionals 
of the  employees  approximately  were in israel   were in india  were in north america  were in europe and were in the asia pacific region 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and which could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from contracts for system integration and application development services  outsourcing  consultation  quality assurance and training services as well sales of third party software licenses 
we provide services on either a fixed price or time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as services are performed based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated billing rates 
we also charge our clients for certain costs and expenses  such as the installation of hardware and cost of subcontractors 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term development projects 
we recognize revenues related to these contracts using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs expected upon completion 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the resources and time required to fulfill the contracts obligations including work effort  materials and subcontractors 
we rely on our experience from other projects in making these estimates  and  in addition  use our internal project management and financial systems to track and manage the projects 
employees and project managers regularly submit updates to these systems  which are then used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
these systems are updated on a regular basis by inputs from employees and project managers estimates  which produce analysis  and are used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
historically  our estimates have been indicative of our actual results  however  there have been a few cases where we had to adjust assumptions  primarily regarding work effort 
we generally recognize revenues on a gross basis  representing the entire amount  because we bear the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and have latitude in establishing product pricing above specific minimums 
management determines whether we bear the risks and rewards of ownership based on relevant sale contract terms 
whenever the majority of contract terms indicate that we bear the risks and rewards  revenues are recognized on a gross basis 
for software license sales and hardware sales  we record revenues on a net basis  based on management s determination that majority of contract terms indicate that we do not bear the risks and rewards related to such contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple revenue activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets  management assumes that separate contracts with the same party entered into at or near the same time are a package  and allocate the associated consideration to the separate activities based on their relative fair values 
in order to determine the fair values of the different activities covered by each agreement  management applies standard pricing used for products and services in similar arrangements and hourly rates based on similar activities we have performed for other clients 
our revenue recognition approach for software licensing requires that  in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition as amended  four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for subsidiaries with transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  monetary accounts maintained in other currencies are re measured into their functional currency in accordance with statement no 
of the financial accounting standards board fasb foreign currency translation 
all transaction gains and losses from the re measurement of monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the statement of operations as financial income or expenses as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the credit worthiness of each client based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in each financial period  we estimate the likelihood of collecting every receivable and record a cumulative allowance 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on adoption and at least annually thereafter or between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital for the reportable unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill 
as of december   no impairment losses were identified 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in measuring the recoverability of assets  we are required to make estimates and judgments in assessing our forecast and cash flows and compare that with the carrying amount of the assets 
additional significant estimates used by management in the methodologies used to assess the recoverability of our long lived assets include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long tem growth rates  market acceptance of products and services  and other judgmental assumptions  which are also affected by factors detailed in our risk factors section in this annual report 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our long lived assets 
capitalized software development costs our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as a development expense or cost of license fee 
software development costs incurred from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release should be capitalized 
we define technological feasibility as the completion of a detailed program design 
the determination of technological feasibility requires the exercise of judgment by our management 
since we sell our products in a market that is subject to rapid technological changes  new product development and changing customer needs  changes in circumstances and estimations may significantly affect the timing and the amounts of software development costs capitalized and thus our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred taxes management judgment is required in determining our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from our deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
if we determine that we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination is made 
on the other hand  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
income taxes through our operating subsidiaries  we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and may be subject to tax audit in these jurisdictions 
these tax audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
under apb  we recognize compensation expense when the exercise price of our share options is less than the fair market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
the calculation of the intrinsic value of a stock award is based on management s estimate of the fair value of our common stock 
changes in this estimate could have a material impact on our compensation expense 
severance pay the liability of our israeli subsidiaries for severance pay is calculated pursuant to israel s severance pay law based on the most recent salary of israeli employees multiplied by the number of years of employment  as of the balance sheet date 
employees are entitled to one month s salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof 
this liability is fully provided for by monthly deposits into severance pay funds  insurance policies and by an accrual 
the value of these policies is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to israel s severance pay law or labor agreements 
the value of the deposited funds is based on the cash surrender value of these policies  and includes immaterial profits

long term and short term debt at december   we had aggregate short term and long term bank and other borrowings of million  consisting of various notes denominated in dollars and nis linked to index with interest rates ranging from approximately to and a weighted average interest rate of approximately  with maturities of one to four years 
these aggregate bank borrowings included million from bank hapoalim  with an interest rate of approximately and maturity of one year  million from israel discount bank  with interest rates of approximately to and maturities of two to three years  and million from five other lenders  in amounts ranging from million to million  with interest rates of approximately to and maturities of up to four years 
the maximum interest rate for our dollar linked borrowings was approximately  and for nis index linked borrowings was approximately 
anticipated capital expenditures in  we used million of the proceeds of our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of to further reduce net debt beyond the net debt reduction of million accomplished in the fourth quarter of  exceeding our previously announced million debt reduction plan 
following the use of proceeds  our only material indebtedness is amounts owed by ness technologies holdings ltd  one of our subsidiaries  to bank hapoalim and israel discount bank 
the shares of two of our israeli subsidiaries are pledged to these banks as security for borrowings under the agreements 
we are currently the process of canceling the pledges on these shares 
the relevant debt instruments contain customary restrictive covenants relating to the borrower and our wholly owned subsidiary ness at ltd  including the following limitations on incurring debt  prohibition on pledging assets  prohibition on distributing dividends  stockholders equity must not be less than of its total assets  ebitda must not be less than of revenues and not less than nis million  and limitations on merging or transferring assets 
in addition  the israel discount bank agreement requires that the net cash and liquid assets of the borrower must not be lower than million 
as of december   we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all of our covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants could lead to an event of default under the agreements governing some or all of the indebtedness  permitting the applicable lender to accelerate all borrowings under the applicable agreement  and to foreclose on any collateral 
anticipated needs we intend to fund future growth through cash flow from operations  available bank borrowings and the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering 
we believe the remaining balance of the proceeds of our initial public offering  together with borrowings and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
in order to achieve our strategic business objectives  we may be required to seek additional financing 
for example  future acquisitions may require additional equity and or debt financing 
in addition  we may require further capital to continue to develop our technology and infrastructure and for working capital purposes 
these financings may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts or any synthetic leases 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long term debt  operating leases and accrued severance pay 
we have no long term obligations for a period longer than three years 
we have summarized in the table below our fixed contractual cash obligations for long term debt and operating leases as of december  dollars in thousands

recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires companies to recognize in the statements of income  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures will no longer be permissible 
the new statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we plan to adopt the new statement effective january   using the modified prospective method 
we believe that the adoption of this new statement will have an impact on our results of operations and net earnings per share as we will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments 
however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors
