overview we were formed in august and began our banking operations in april with our acquisition of the bank 
since april  we have grown from million in assets to billion at december   expanded our community banking offices to from two  established our corporate office where we provide many of our banking services  expanded our commercial lending regional offices to arizona  florida  pennsylvania  michigan  and dallas  texas  and initiated a mortgage banking business with retail mortgage offices in states throughout the united states and three wholesale offices in texas  california and tennessee 
our historical financial results reflect the development of our business 
during  we incurred the non interest expense related to our expansion and the infrastructure cost necessary to support the expansion 
at the end of and throughout  we began to acquire and originate loans and other earning assets  which have increased our revenues to a level commensurate with the expenses that we incurred in our development stage 
during and  we have continued to see the results from the execution of our business strategy as our asset and revenue growth have offset the ongoing cost of executing our business strategy 
we have achieved improved levels of profitability as our businesses have begun to generate earning assets and revenues that exceed their ongoing operating expenses 
we will continue to make additional investments in our businesses to expand the range of our product lines and services 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  involve a significant amount of subjective and complex judgment by our management 
these policies relate to our allowance for credit losses  rate lock commitments and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable given the circumstances existing at the time such estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
however  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
allowance for credit losses we maintain our allowance for credit losses at the amount estimated by management to be sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolios based on available information 
our estimates of credit losses meet the criteria for accrual of loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
when analyzing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses  we consider such factors as historical loss experience  delinquency status  identification of adverse situations that may affect the ability of obligors to repay  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  assessment of economic conditions  regulatory policies and the estimated value of the underlying collateral  if any 
single family mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated as a group 
builder lines  commercial real estate  commercial business  mortgage banker finance and multi family loans are evaluated individually 
the allowance for credit losses is based principally on the frequency and severity of losses for an asset class  the historical loss experience for the type of loan and the delinquency status 
the process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses has two basic elements first  the identification of problem loans based on current operating financial information and fair value of the underlying collateral property  and second  a methodology for estimating general credit losses 
for loans classified as watch  special mention  substandard or doubtful  whether analyzed and provided for individually or as part of pools  we record all estimated credit losses at the time the loan is classified 
in order to facilitate the establishment of our general allowance for credit losses  we have established a risk grade classification system for components of our loan portfolio that do not have homogeneous terms  such as commercial loans 
this system grades loans based on credit and collateral support for each loan 
the grades range from one  which represents the least possible risk to us  to eight  for doubtful loans 
each credit grade has a general minimum credit allowance factor established for each type of loan 
we use this general credit allowance factor in establishing our allowance for credit losses 
we establish the credit loss allowance through a systematic methodology whereby each loan is assigned a credit grade at origination 
we establish the allowance for credit losses by using the credit allowance factor for the individual loan  based on the risk classification  and providing as the allowance for credit loss the product of the loan balance times the credit allowance factor over the initial twelve months of the loan s term 
for homogeneous loans  such as single family mortgage and consumer loans  we utilize the frequency and severity of losses for the asset class and the delinquency status in determining the credit allowance factor 
the allowance for credit losses is determined by multiplying the portfolio balance by the credit allowance factor for the portfolio and providing the resulting amount ratably over twelve months 
when available information confirms specific loans  or portions of those loans  to be uncollectible  we charge off those amounts against the allowance for credit losses 
even after loans are charged off  we continue reasonable collection efforts until the potential for recovery is exhausted 
see credit quality allowance for credit losses 
rate lock commitments in connection with our mortgage banking activities  we enter into interest rate lock commitments with loan applicants whereby the interest rate on the loan is guaranteed for a certain period of time while the application is in the approval process  which we refer to as the locked pipeline 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  interest rate lock commitments are derivative financial instruments and changes in their fair value are required to be reported in current earnings 
the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is determined as of the date the interest rate is locked and is based on the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loans  including the value of the servicing when selling the loans with the servicing in the same transaction to the same party 
when the loans are sold and the servicing is retained by the company  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgages  excluding the value of the servicing 
generally  we base the change in the value of the underlying mortgages on quoted market prices of publicly traded mortgage backed securities 
management estimates the amount of loans expected to close by applying a fall out ratio for commitments that expire 
this estimate is based on the historical data for loans with similar characteristics as well as current market conditions 
we record changes in the fair value as gains or losses on sales of single family loans on the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
goodwill is tested for impairment using quoted market prices and transactions involving similar types of institutions to determine if the fair value of our assets  net of liabilities  exceeds the carrying amount 
if the fair value of our net assets is determined to be less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be written down through a charge to operations

this compares to million in non performing assets at december   comprised of million in loans that were in nonaccrual status  and million of real estate owned 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming four payments past due as to interest or principal 
generally  consumer loans that are not secured are placed in nonaccrual status when deemed uncollectible 
such loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  the accrued but uncollected interest receivable is reversed and accounted for on a cash or recovery method thereafter  until qualifying for return to accrual status 
management s classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal of the loan is uncollectible in whole or in part 
additional interest income of million   and  would have been recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively  had the loans been accruing according to their original terms

non performing loans at december   and are based on those days or more delinquent 
at december  and  we had million and million in loans that were classified as potential problem loans that are not included in non performing assets 
these are loans that management believes may in the future become non performing loans 
allowance for credit losses we establish an allowance for credit losses based on management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio and consider such factors as historical loss experience  delinquency status  identification of adverse situations that may affect the ability of obligors to repay  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  assessment of economic conditions  regulatory policies and the estimated value of the underlying collateral  if any 
single family mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated as a group 
builder lines  commercial real estate  commercial business  mortgage banker finance and multi family loans are evaluated individually 
the allowance for credit losses is based principally on the frequency and severity of losses for an asset class  the historical loss experience for the type of loan and the delinquency status 
our process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses has two basic elements first  the identification of problem loans based on current operating information and fair value of the underlying collateral property  and second  a methodology for estimating general credit loss reserves 
for loans classified as watch  special mention  substandard or doubtful  whether analyzed and provided for individually or as part of pools  all estimated credit losses are recorded at the time the loan is classified 
in order to facilitate the establishment of our general allowance for credit losses  we have established a risk grade classification system for components of our loan portfolio that do not have homogeneous terms  such as commercial loans 
this system grades loans based on credit and collateral support for each loan 
the grades range from one  which represents the least possible risk to us  to eight  for doubtful loans 
each credit grade has a general minimum credit allowance factor established for each type of loan 
in determining our credit allowance factors we utilized various studies  including the ots historical charge off percentages and the national association of home builders study of construction lending charge offs from to we use this general credit allowance factor in establishing our allowance for credit losses 
we establish the credit loss allowance through a systematic methodology whereby each loan is assigned a credit grade at origination 
we establish the allowance for credit losses by using the credit allowance factor for the individual loan  based on the risk classification  and providing as the allowance for credit loss the product of the loan balance times the credit allowance factor over the initial twelve months of the loan s term 
for homogeneous loans  such as single family mortgages and consumer loans  we utilize the frequency and severity of losses for the asset class in determining the credit allowance factor 
the allowance for credit losses is determined by multiplying the portfolio balance by the credit allowance factor for the portfolio and providing the resulting amount ratably over twelve months 
when a borrower s ability to repay a loan under the original terms is uncertain  our risk management committee or loan officer may downgrade the loan to a classified status 
when a loan is classified  the credit allowance expected to be required on the loan that is in excess of the general allowance is immediately charged to operations 
when available information confirms specific loans  or portions of those loans  to be uncollectible  such amounts are charged off against the allowance for credit losses 
the bank s risk management committee reviews on a quarterly basis the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and reports its findings to the board of directors at its next scheduled meeting 
the risk management committee is also responsible for approving upgrades to a loan s grade 
the allowance for credit losses at december  was million  or of total loans outstanding  an increase of million from december  the increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily due to a million allowance on a mortgage banker finance loan where the customer ceased operations in the fourth quarter of management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the following table allocates the allowance for credit losses based on management s judgment of potential losses in the respective areas based on our systematic method

additionally  we have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits 
these borrowing sources include the fhlb of dallas  a short term line of credit and securities sold under repurchase agreements

at december   we had borrowed million on our million line of credit and had no securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are a holding company without any significant assets other than our equity interest in the bank 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or to meet our other cash obligations  including the servicing of our junior notes  is subject to the amount of liquid assets that we maintain on a separate basis from the bank and the receipt of dividends from the bank 
at december   we had approximately million in available cash and the bank had the ability to pay approximately million in dividends to us without prior regulatory approval

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income  fair market values and capital to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other relevant market prices and rates 
the primary market risk that we are exposed to is interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
substantially all of our interest rate risk arises from these activities entered into for purposes other than trading 
the principal objective of our asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net income to changing interest rates 
asset liability management is governed by a policy approved annually by our board of directors 
our board of directors has delegated the oversight of the administration to the bank s asset liability committee 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by executive management and the bank s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
interest rate risk management the asset liability committee manages our interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet to seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk to changes in market interest rates 
the achievement of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk 
the asset liability committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of risk within the guidelines approved by the board of directors  the asset liability committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the asset liability committee meets regularly to review the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the asset liability committee reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits  consumer and commercial deposit activity  current market conditions  and interest rates both on a local and national level 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to ensure that our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
these strategies include adjusting the terms and pricing of our loans  deposits and borrowings and managing the deployments of our securities and short term assets to reduce or increase the mismatches in interest rate repricing 
when appropriate  our management may utilize instruments such as interest rate swaps  floors and caps to hedge our interest rate position 
as of december   we had entered into interest swaps to adjust the repricing characteristics of million of our junior notes from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
we also manage the risks associated with our mortgage warehouse and pipeline 
our mortgage warehouse consists of fixed rate single family mortgage loans that are to be sold in the secondary market 
our pipeline consists of commitments to originate single family mortgage loans  both fixed and adjustable rate 
the fixed rate loans in the pipeline will be sold in the secondary market 
the risk associated with the pipeline is the potential for changes in interest rates on these types of loans from the time the customer locks in the rate on the loan and the time we sell the loan in the secondary market 
to manage this risk  we enter into forward sales agreements to protect us from rising interest rates 
on a forward sales agreement the sales price and delivery date are established at the time the agreement is entered into 
in determining the amount of forward commitments to enter into  we consider the amount of loans with interest rate locks  the level of current market rates for similar products and the amount of commitments that are not expected to close before the expiration of the rate lock 
one way to measure the impact that future changes in interest rates will have is through an interest rate sensitivity gap measure 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  thus changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
our one year cumulative interest rate gap position at december  was a negative gap of million  or  of total assets 
this is a one day position which is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
additionally  the gap analysis does not consider the many factors accompanying interest rate moves 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or re pricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  our assets tend to have prepayments that are slower than those in an interest rate sensitivity gap and would increase our negative gap position 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  our assets would tend to prepay faster than expected thus decreasing the negative gap 
interest rate sensitivity we use interest management contracts as tools to manage our interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the key contractual terms associated with these contracts december  maturity range fair notional after value amount dollars in thousands interest rate risk management contracts asset liability management pay fixed swaps contractual maturity pay rate receive rate forward sales commitments contractual maturity weighted average price december  maturity range fair notional after value amount dollars in thousands interest rate risk management contracts asset liability management pay fixed swaps contractual maturity pay rate receive rate forward sales commitments contractual maturity weighted average price the following table represents the expected repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities at december   utilizing the assumptions noted below amounts maturing or repricing in one year but less than more than one to over five non rate three months three months five years years sensitive total dollars in thousands assets cash  investment securities and mortgage backed securities single family mortgages commercial and consumer loans other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity certificate of deposits money market and savings checking total deposits federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated notes short term borrowings other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a percentage of assets based on scheduled maturity or scheduled repricing and estimated prepayments of principal

based on projected decay rates and or repricing 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
based on these simulations  we quantify interest rate risk and develop and implement strategies we consider to be appropriate 
at december   we used a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to an immediate parallel and sustained shift in interest rates derived from the current treasury and libor yield curves 
for both the rising rate and falling rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased by and basis points 
at december   our net interest income exposure was within the guidelines established by our board of directors 
the following table indicates the sensitivity of net interest income to the interest rate movements described above adjusted net percentage interest rate scenario interest income change from base in thousands up basis points up basis points base down basis points down basis points we also measure the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of our assets and liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as market value of equity  using a simulation model

further  the computations do not take into account any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
