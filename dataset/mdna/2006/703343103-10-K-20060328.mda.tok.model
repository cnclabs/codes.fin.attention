item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general for the company  fiscal could be characterized by opportunity and execution 
in  through organizational and operational changes  the company established its platform for future growth 
in the company set out on its strategic plan to capitalize on that platform 
while the first three quarters of provided fairly stagnant market conditions and company earnings at approximately million  or 
per share  the spike in demand for fema units in the fourth quarter in the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries  as a result of the need for temporary housing in hurricane damaged areas  produced market conditions not seen in many years  and an opportunity for the company to perform under almost optimal conditions 
consequently the company posted operating results in the fourth quarter which bettered any quarter in the last four years 
further  the company s size  national presence  available capacity  and valued employee and supplier relationships proved to be invaluable in accommodating this need and we were able to continue to provide quality service to our customers in this time of national crisis 
after several years of reporting relatively flat operating performance  the company posted its strongest operating results since revenues in the fourth quarter increased over from the previous year and represented the highest quarter in the fiscal year 
annual revenues were million  or ahead of the million reported in  and the highest since fiscal operating income for the quarter was million compared to  in  and net income was million  or 
per share  compared to a loss of million  or 
per share in operating income for the year was million  or more than doubled the million reported in  and the highest since net income reported for the year was also the highest since  at million  or 
per share  compared to million in  or 
per share 
operating income in includes an additional million  or 
per share  related to additional volume incentive rebates from certain vendors as a result of increased production and sales for the year 
the results include a million  or 
net of tax  charge to operations for bad debts related to one customer  and gains of approximately million  or 
net of tax  related to life insurance proceeds and a sale of buildings 
interest expense increased approximately million from the previous year due to the company taking on million of fixed term debt financing in march  to support its capital expenditure plan 
capital expenditures were million in and over the past three years were approximately million 
as the most recent capital initiative is complete  estimated capital expenditures for are million 
receivables increased from the prior year due to the increased sales in the fourth quarter and inventory levels decreased as a result of the company s strategic initiative to maintain certain turn levels 
the company expects inventory levels to rise in the first quarter  due to the expected increase in demand  however turn targets have been set for the year to maximize inventory utilization 
on a macroeconomic level  the year was characterized by economic uncertainty  a booming housing market  rising interest rates  unstable gasoline prices  and massive destruction as a result of the hurricanes in the southeast 
additionally  large losses and workforce reductions in the us auto industry and intensified political pressure as a result of the war in iraq clouded the overall economic picture 
market conditions for most of the year in the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries  which represent of the company s sales at december   included a manufactured housing industry in its third consecutive year with shipments at their lowest levels in more than years  and a recreational vehicle industry that is performing at optimum levels not seen in less than years 
the market conditions in the industrial market sector  which comprise of the company s december  sales  were bolstered by strong residential housing starts and continued commercial building development 
the manufactured housing industry  which represents approximately of the company s sales at december   continued to ship units at a stagnant pace for the first three quarters of while first quarter shipments improved more than over the previous year and appeared to have some momentum aided by hurricanes in the fourth quarter of  the second and third quarters quickly leveled off finishing a combined down from the previous year s comparable period 
the fema demand in the fourth quarter boosted shipment levels by from and year to date  and provided a temporary fix to many of the economic difficulties affecting the manufactured housing industry 
retail dealer lots were emptied and plants rushed to fill capacity levels 
while the initial spike lasted for the fourth quarter  it remains unclear when and if there will be another round of fema orders released 
further  the economic uncertainty related to financing has not yet been solved and provides an unclear picture as to what the future holds for this market in the traditional sense 
many of the manufacturers are continuing to shift towards modular units where land home financing is more readily available and comparable with traditional residential housing terms 
overall  the company s sales to the manufactured housing industry were up more than from the previous year 
the recreational vehicle industry  which represents approximately of the company s december  sales  continued on its torrid pace for the first quarter of with shipments improving more than over those in the second quarter gave indications that dealer lots were filling up and that demand was decreasing as shipments decreased almost from third quarter shipments improved more than and fourth quarter shipments were up as a result of the fema demand 
year to date shipments were up almost from and have surpassed the  unit level for only the second time in twenty five years 
the company s sales to the recreational vehicle industry were comparable with those in decreased sales and production levels at certain of our customers had a direct impact on the company keeping up with overall industry increases on a percentage basis 
while higher gasoline prices appear to have affected the motorized units which are down more than from  towable units are still in demand and finished the year more than ahead of this demand  exclusive of the fema situation  is expected to continue through the first quarter 
the industrial market sector  which represents approximately of the company s sales at december   also provided opportunities to increase market share with the products associated with residential housing  where sales of new family homes grew over from  and commercial and office furniture and fixture sales were up more than 
the products supplied to these markets are characterized by longer production runs resulting in increased operating efficiencies  and a less price driven customer base 
while overall market statistics are difficult to derive due to the vast nature of the products involved  complexity of the customer base  and lack of available industry trade information  the company s sales to these sectors increased more than from the industrial and other market sector is a key focus area to help diversify the company s customer base 
in  overall sales to this sector were negatively impacted by customer attrition primarily in the residential furniture markets which have been  and will continue to be  severely affected by imports 
the furniture market represents approximately of the company s total industrial sales mix 
while market conditions in all of the sectors that the company participates remain questionable and any downturns could have a material impact on operating performance  the company continues to have adequate capacity to support future growth and the financial strength to drive its strategic plan 
key focus areas for include identifying and executing strategic accretive acquisitions  capturing market share  maintaining a lean organizational structure  controlling costs  and growing all areas of the business 
the company is structured to take on significantly more revenue without adding significant incremental overhead and therefore improve contribution rates with increased volume  and increase profitability and shareholder returns
