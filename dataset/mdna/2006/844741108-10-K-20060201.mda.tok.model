item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for its rd consecutive year  and also extended its number of consecutive profitable quarters to southwest s profit was million  representing a increase compared to our profit of million 
this performance was driven primarily by strong revenue growth  as the company grew capacity  and effective cost control measures  including a successful fuel hedge program 
for the fifth consecutive year  the airline industry as a whole is expected to suffer a substantial net loss  as additional carriers filed for bankruptcy protection and many underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure or merge their businesses  gain wage concessions from their employees  and slash costs 
the revenue environment in the airline industry strengthened considerably throughout as a result of the extensive restructuring in the domestic airline industry in and  several carriers reduced domestic capacity 
industry capacity reductions and strong demand resulted in high load factors for many airlines 
in fact  southwest set new monthly load factor records for four separate months during  and recorded a company record load factor of percent for the full year 
the company was also able to modestly raise its fares over the course of the year  resulting in an increase in passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles of percent compared to unit revenue total revenue divided by asms also increased a healthy percent compared to levels  as a result of the higher load factors and higher rpm yields 
the company once again benefited from a strong fuel hedge and an intense focus on controlling non fuel costs 
as reflected in the consolidated statement of income  the company s fuel hedging program resulted in a reduction to fuel and oil expense during of million 
the company s hedge program also resulted in earnings variability throughout  primarily due to unrealized gains and losses relating to fuel contracts settling in future periods  recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
for  these amounts total a net gain of million  and are reflected in other gains losses  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
although the company s fuel hedge in place for is not as strong as that in  absent a significant decrease from the current level of market energy prices the company will continue to have a considerable competitive advantage compared to airlines that have not hedged fuel 
the company hopes to overcome the impact of higher anticipated fuel prices through improved revenue management and control of non fuel costs 
as a result of cost control efforts instituted over the past years  the company was able to produce a reduction in non fuel unit costs cost per asm of percent in compared to the company s employees again increased their productivity and improved the overall efficiency of the company s operations 
the company s headcount per aircraft decreased from at december   to at december  furthermore  since the end of  the company s headcount per aircraft has decreased percent

holding other factors constant such as yields and load factor  almost percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the company s percent increase in available seat miles compared to the company increased available seat miles as a result of the net addition of aircraft new aircraft net of five aircraft retirements 
approximately percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the percent increase in passenger yields 
average passenger fares increased percent compared to  primarily due to lower fare discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled with the availability of fewer seats from industrywide domestic capacity reductions 
the remainder of the passenger revenue increase primarily was due to the point increase in the company s load factor compared to the percent load factor for represented the highest annual load factor in the company s history 
the company continues to be encouraged by the airline revenue environment 
although the company significantly downsized its new orleans operations following hurricane katrina during third quarter  some of those flights have been added back as demand has increased to that city

excluding fuel  casm was percent lower than  at cents 
for first quarter  the company currently expects operating expenses per asm  excluding fuel  to exceed the first quarter level of cents  but improve from fourth quarter s cents

salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm decreased 
percent compared to  primarily due to productivity efforts that have enabled the company to grow overall headcount at a rate that is less than the growth in asms

the company estimates that these and other efficiency gains saved the company approximately million during  at average unhedged market jet fuel prices 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has hedges in place for over percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in with a combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at average crude oil equivalent price of approximately per barrel  and has hedged the refinery margins on the majority of those positions 
considering current market prices  the company is forecasting a significant increase compared to the company s first quarter average fuel price per gallon of cents  primarily because the company s hedge position is not as strong and market jet fuel prices are currently higher in the company has a lower percentage of its fuel hedged  and the hedges in place are at higher average crude oil equivalent prices 
the majority of the company s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts  which protect the company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the company to benefit in the event of declining prices 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent compared to  primarily due to a decrease in repair events for aircraft engines

an increase in depreciation expense per asm from new aircraft purchased during and the higher percentage of owned aircraft  was more than offset by lower expense associated with the company s retirement of its fleet and all remaining spare parts by the end of january based on the company s scheduled aircraft purchase commitments and capital expenditure plans  the company expects first quarter depreciation expense per asm to be slightly above the first quarter level of cents per asm 
other operating expenses per asm increased percent compared to approximately percent of the increase relates to higher security fees in the form of a million retroactive assessment the company received from the transportation security administration in january the company intends to vigorously contest this assessment  however  if it is unsuccessful in reversing or modifying it  security fees will be at similar levels

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million  compared to million as of december  
table of contents estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
holding other factors constant  a ten percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets for would have resulted in a million change in passenger revenues recognized for that period 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns  as noted  can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
no material adjustments were recorded for years   or the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated residual estimated useful life value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing  the manufacturer of the company s aircraft 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization 
table of contents expense  as required by gaap 
the company does not expect its transition to a new  more efficient heavy maintenance program for and airframes in to have an impact on the estimated useful lives for those aircraft 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this change 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices  and accounts for them under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
see qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas  the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
sfas requires that all derivatives be marked to market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to fuel hedging  for year and beyond 
the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was billion  compared to million at december  the large increase in fair value primarily was due to the dramatic increase in energy prices throughout  and the company s addition of derivative instruments to increase its hedge positions in future years 
changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically  as was evident during  based on changes in the underlying commodity prices 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
based on these actual results once all values and prices become known  the company s estimates have proved to be materially accurate 
estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the total change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel 
table of contents to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period 
likewise  if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  those periodic changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded to other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially considering the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
in addition  given the magnitude of the company s fuel hedge portfolio total market value  ineffectiveness can be highly material to financial results 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate 
this may result in increased volatility in the company s results 
prior to  the company had not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under sfas  in relation to the fair value of the underlying financial derivative instruments 
the significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains on derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during was due to a number of factors 
these factors included the recent significant increase in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses in hedging 
the number of instances in which the company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges has increased recently  primarily due to the foregoing reasons 
in these cases  the company has determined that the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting  as defined by sfas when this happens  any changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings in the period of change 
as the fair value of the company s hedge positions increases in amount  there is a higher degree of probability that there will be continued and correspondingly higher variability recorded in the income statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in future periods will be material 
this is primarily due to the fact that small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes 
sfas is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements  including the documentation of a company hedging strategy  statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis  and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is executed by the company 
as required by sfas  the company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
the company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges  as required by sfas any changes to the company s methodology for estimating future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices will be applied prospectively  in accordance with sfas while the company would expect that a change in the methodology for estimating future cash flows would result in more effective hedges over the long term  such a change could result in more ineffectiveness  as defined  in the short term  due to the prospective nature of enacting the change 
the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
the primary objective for the company s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
concurrently  the company s interest rate hedges are also intended to take advantage of market conditions in which short term rates are significantly lower than the fixed longer term rates on the company s long term debt 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due  and million class a pass through certificates due the floating rate paid under each agreement sets in arrears 
under the first agreement  the company pays the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid 
table of contents under this agreement during is estimated to be percent based on actual and forward rates at december  under the second agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until november  based on actual and forward rates at december   the average floating rate paid under this agreement during is estimated to be percent 
during  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to its million senior unsecured notes due under this agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the floating rate is set in advance 
the average floating rate paid under this agreement during was percent 
the company s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and  thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  as necessary  with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was a liability of approximately million 
the comparable fair value of these same agreements at december   was a liability of million 
the long term portion of these amounts are recorded in other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for each respective year and the current portion is reflected in accrued liabilities 
in accordance with fair value hedging  the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices  would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
forward looking statements some statements in this form k or otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise which are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements about southwest s estimates  expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future  and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements 
southwest uses the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or the company s present expectations 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to  those set forth under item a risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the company s forward looking statements  which represent the company s views only as of the date this report is filed

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for 
table of contents information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging 
the company utilizes its fuel hedges  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s fuel hedges 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were net assets of billion 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as fuel hedge contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or billion  is included in other assets 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
at december   the company had agreements with seven counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels 
at december   the company held million in cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions 
these collateral deposits serve to decrease  but not totally eliminate  the credit risk associated with the company s hedging program 
the deposits are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial market risk 
the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million class a pass through certificates due  and the million senior unsecured notes due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
excluding the million senior unsecured notes  and the million senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  these senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the fixed rate portion of 
table of contents the company s pass through certificates consists of its class a certificates and class b certificates  which totaled million at december  these class a and class b certificates had fixed rates averaging percent at december  and mature during the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent at december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled million  at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  auction rate securities  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement  the revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings 
for the revolving credit facility  the company shall also maintain  at all times  a coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of not less than to the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written
