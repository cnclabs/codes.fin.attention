overview core molding technologies is a compounder of sheet molding composite smc and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics 
core molding technologies produces high quality fiberglass reinforced molded products and smc materials for varied markets  including light  medium and heavy duty trucks  automobiles and automotive aftermarkets  personal watercraft and other commercial products 
the demand for core molding technologies products is affected by economic conditions in the united states  canada and mexico 
core molding technologies manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core molding technologies operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
on december   core molding technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of international s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late columbus plastics  located in columbus  ohio  was a compounder and compression molder of smc 
in  core molding technologies began compression molding operations at its second facility in gaffney  south carolina  and in october  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of airshield corporation 
as a result of this acquisition  core molding technologies expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up  hand lay up open mold processes and resin transfer rtm closed mold process 
in september  core molding technologies acquired substantially all the operating assets of keystone restyling products  inc  a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced products for the automotive aftermarket industry 
in august  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of the cincinnati fiberglass division of diversified glass  inc  a batavia  ohio based  privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy duty truck market 
the batavia  ohio facility produces reinforced plastic products by a robotic spray up open mold process and resin transfer molding rtm utilizing multiple insert tooling mit closed mold process 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate increase from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project revenues are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend 
total product sales revenue for  excluding tooling project revenue  totaled  an approximate increase from the  reported for the primary reason for this increase was due to the positive impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for medium and heavy duty trucks as well as the addition of the recently acquired batavia  ohio facility 
sales to international totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase was due to the positive impact of general economic conditions and the affect on product sales

sales to yamaha in amounted to  which was lower than the  in the primary reason for this decrease was due to the decision of yamaha to diversify its supplier base 
sales to other customers increased by approximately to  in from  in the increase in sales was primarily due to the addition of core molding technologies automotive aftermarket division  which was acquired in september of also contributing to this increase are new customers at core molding technologies matamoros facility as well as the positive impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for medium and heavy duty trucks 
sales to other customers were offset by lower sales to lear reflecting lower demand for sport utility vehicles 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales from the prior year  was due to a combination of many factors 
the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales from the prior year  was primarily due to production efficiencies related to labor and material usage 
increases in production volumes also added to the increased gross margin for the current year  as core molding technologies was better able to absorb its fixed cost of production 
the benefit gained in gross margin was partially offset by increases in raw material and energy costs as well as increases in the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in labor costs  certain employee benefits and the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
net interest expense totaled  in  decreasing from  in the primary reasons for this decrease were due to interest income of  in compared to  in  as well as  a reduction in debt from regularly scheduled principal payments 
interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its long term borrowing facilities were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swaps core molding technologies entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to in the increase is primarily due to the company eliminating its valuation reserve in related to its tax operating loss carryforwards 
this reserve was reduced by  as a result of the company anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as the company has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  the company reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense

gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales from the prior year  was due to a combination of many factors 
the primary reason for the increase was due to the increase in sales volume  which enabled the company to better absorb its fixed costs of production 
the benefit gained by the increase in sales volume was partially offset by additional costs incurred as a result of increases in raw material costs  primarily due to price increases for resin  which is a significant component of smc 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices increased and continue to rise into also offsetting the benefit gained were inefficiencies related to material usage and the nine day strike at the company s columbus plant  as well as increases in the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in professional fees and outside services and the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
interest expense totaled  for decreasing from  in the primary reason for the decrease was due to the refinancing of long term debt with international truck and engine corporation in december interest rates experienced by the company with respect to the industrial revenue bond and bank note payable were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swaps the company entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes 
the company s normal tax rate is  however  the company eliminated its valuation reserve related to its tax operating loss carryforwards 
this reserve was reduced by  as a result of the company anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as the company has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  the company reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds have been cash generated from operating activities and borrowings from third parties 
the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital in totaled  changes in working capital reduced cash provided by operating activities by  to  net income contributed  to operating cash flows 
non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization contributed  to operating cash flow 
the decrease in deferred income taxes also had a positive impact on operating cash flows of  which is primarily a result of core molding technologies net operating loss carryforwards reducing current year tax obligations 
the company used all net operating loss carryforwards in in addition  the increase in the postretirement healthcare benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation  and this item will not be a cash obligation until retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 
changes in working capital primarily relate to increases in accounts receivable  which is primarily related to increased sales volume and the addition of the batavia  ohio production facility and a decrease in accounts payable due to timing differences 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december  capital expenditures totaled  which was primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment at its production facilities 
at december   commitments for capital expenditures in progress were  capital expenditures for are expected to be  primarily related to an expansion project at the company s columbus  ohio facility to support two new programs for existing customers 
these programs are scheduled to launch in the purchases of certain assets of cincinnati fiberglass  inc for  contributed to the overall use of cash for investing activities 
contributing to cash flows from investing activities was  from the maturity of a mortgage backed security investment and  from the sale of property plant and equipment 
financing activities reduced cash flow by  core molding technologies made principal repayments on its existing bank note payable of  and regularly scheduled payments on the industrial revenue bond of  partially offsetting these payments were proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of  stock options 
at december   the company had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  line of credit  which is scheduled to mature on april  at december   core molding technologies had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
management expects these resources to be adequate to meet core molding technologies liquidity needs 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its two financial debt covenants for the line of credit and letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios 
management expects core molding technologies to meet these covenants for the year however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of core molding technologies should occur  core molding technologies liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
the company has the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  the tables below include only those contracts  which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt      interest      operating lease obligations      contractual commitments for capital expenditures   postretirement benefits      total      interest is calculated based on adjusting the variable interest rate to the effective interest rate due to the swap agreements in place for both long term borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for customer returns  discounts offered to customers  and for price adjustments 
should customer returns  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company has reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities below the assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and self insurance the company is self insured with respect to most of its columbus  ohio and gaffney  south carolina medical and dental claims and columbus  ohio workers compensation claims 
the company has recorded an estimated liability for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at december   and of  and  respectively 
post retirement benefits management records an accrual for postretirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated notes to financial statements 
core molding technologies recorded a liability for postretirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
the deferred tax asset of  at december   primarily includes temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its four largest customers international  freightliner  paccar  and yamaha  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices have increased and are expected to continue to rise in these increases could have a significant impact on the future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but believes it will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and our related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we will record non cash stock compensation expense of unvested stock options outstanding beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of the adoption of sfas r will depend on share based payments in the future  we currently expect a reduction to diluted earnings per share of approximately in in november  the fasb issued fsp no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the accumulated paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating this transition method 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin as an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december there is no material effect to the consolidated financial statements from adoption of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding technologies primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
core molding technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the mexican peso 
core molding technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding technologies has the following five items that are sensitive to market risks industrial revenue bond irb with a variable interest rate 
core molding technologies has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  revolving line of credit  which bears a variable interest rate  bank note payable with a variable interest rate 
core molding technologies entered into a swap agreement effective january   to fix the interest rate at  foreign currency purchases in which core molding technologies purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to the facility located in mexico  and raw material purchases in which core molding technologies purchases various resins for use in production 
the prices of these resins are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand 
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  core molding technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs  which would have an adverse effect on operating margins 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates in both and  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would generally offset the impact and the use of core molding technologies revolving line of credit was not material during
