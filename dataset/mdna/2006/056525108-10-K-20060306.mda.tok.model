item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview the company is a leading marketer and manufacturer of products using flow measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other technology companies 
its products are used to measure and control the flow of liquids in a variety of applications 
the company s product lines fall into two general categories  utility and industrial 
the utility category is comprised of two product lines  residential and commercial water meters with various automatic meter reading amr technology systems  which are generally sold to water utilities and constitute a majority of the company s sales 
industrial product line sales comprise the remainder of the company s sales and include automotive fluid meters and systems  small precision valves  electromagnetic meters  impeller flow meters and industrial process meters all with related accessories and instrumentation 
residential and commercial water meters and related systems are classified as local or manual read meters or amr products 
local read meters consist of a water meter and a register 
with amr meters  the register digitally encodes the mechanical reading and its radio frequency transmitter communicates the data to a computerized system that collects the data and sends it to specific utility computerized programs 
net sales and the corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and mix of products  with the company generally earning higher margins on amr products 
the company sells amr products of other companies as well as its own proprietary product  orion  which has higher margins than the other amr products 
orion is currently being sold as a walk by drive by system  but also has the ability to connect with a variety of other technologies  such as power line carrier  broadband over power line  municipal wi fi and radio frequency systems to allow for remote reading of the data 
net sales and the corresponding net earnings are therefore also dependent on the mix of amr products between proprietary and non proprietary products 
there is a base level of annual business for utility products driven by replacement units and  to a lesser extent  housing starts 
sales above the base level depend on conversions to amr away from manual read meters 
the company believes that conversion from local read meters to amr products can accelerate replacements of meters and result in growth  because it is estimated that only of the water meter market has been converted to amr 
badger meter s strategy is to solve customers metering needs with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through alliances within the marketplace 
the industrial products generally serve niche markets and have in the past utilized technology derived from utility products to serve industrial uses 
as these markets evolve  these products are becoming more specialized to meet industrial flow measurement and communication protocol requirements 
serving these markets allows the company to expand its technologies into other areas of flow measurement and control  as well as utilize existing capacity and spread fixed costs over a larger sales base 
results of operations net sales badger meter s net sales of million increased million  or  for compared to the increase was the net result of sales increases in most of the company s product lines  offset by declines in its automotive fluid meters and systems product lines as further discussed below 
residential and commercial water meter customers include independent distributors  large cities  private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities 
one group of the company s sales representatives focuses on distributors  another on large accounts public and private  and a third group focuses on the remaining customers 
sales to customers are influenced by the movement toward amr technologies  the lengthening of the sales cycle and the financial budget conditions of the various water utilities served 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared with in these sales increased million  or  in to million from 
table of contents million in unit volume increased in meters utilizing amr technologies as well as local or manual read meters 
amr technologies carry a higher price  which also contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  net sales increased in part due to a significant increase over levels for the sales volumes of orion  the company s proprietary amr system  which has higher margins than other amr products 
industrial sales are affected by economic conditions  domestically and internationally  in each of the markets served by the various product lines 
the automotive fluid meters and related systems sold through the company s french subsidiary were negatively affected by the delay of new products  loss of a major customer and poor economic conditions in that market  which resulted in lower sales in versus all other industrial product lines showed sales increases in over levels 
in total  the industrial products represented of total net sales in compared to in industrial product sales decreased million to million in compared with million in  which is the net result of a million decrease in automotive fluid meters and systems  offset by a million increase in all other industrial product lines 
international sales are comprised primarily of sales of small valves  electromagnetic meters and automotive fluid meters and systems in europe  sales of water meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros and other currencies 
most other international sales are made in us dollars 
the company is able to partially hedge its euro exposure by holding euro denominated debt 
international sales decreased to million in from million in due principally to lower european sales  offset slightly by the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared with in these sales increased million in to million from million in unit volume increased in meters utilizing amr technologies offset by a slight decline in local or manual read meters 
amr technologies carry a higher price  which also contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  net sales increased in part due to a significant increase over levels for the sales volumes of orion  the company s proprietary amr system introduced in  which has higher margins than other amr products 
in total  the industrial products represented of total net sales in compared with in industrial product sales increased million to million in compared with million in all of the product lines showed growth over the levels  partially due to the effects of the strengthening euro 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to the effects of the strengthening euro 
without the effects from foreign exchange  sales increased due to higher sales in mexico  offset somewhat by lower european sales 
gross margins gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins increased between and due to the higher mix of amr versus local read meters as well as a higher percentage of orion amr technology versus other non proprietary amr products  offset somewhat by higher metal prices 
gross margins were flat between and as a result of a higher mix of amr sales and better plant capacity utilization  offset by increased obsolete inventory reserves and higher metal and resin commodity prices 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs increased in over levels due to higher research and development costs  increased costs associated with higher sales  one time expenses associated with the company s th anniversary celebration and normal inflationary pressures  offset somewhat by continuing cost control efforts 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased in over 
table of contents levels 
overall  inflationary increases were mitigated somewhat by cost savings generated by the consolidation of two of the company s domestic facilities and a continuing emphasis on cost control 
interest expense interest expense was approximately the same in as in this was the net impact of lower debt levels offset by increasing interest rates and a new long term loan replacing short term debt 
interest expense decreased  in compared to due to higher cost long term debt being replaced with lower cost short term debt 
other expense income  net other expense income  net in was income of million versus an expense of million in this was due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro resulting in exchange gains 
other expense income  net in was an expense of million versus income of million in the amount included million of foreign exchange loss compared to an exchange gain of million in the exchange loss was due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and its effects on the company s foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease between and was due to increased domestic earnings which somewhat mitigated the increased valuation reserves for the operating losses of the company s french subsidiary further discussed below  slightly lower state taxes and the estimated effects of the section production activities deduction as permitted under the american jobs creation act of the increase in from was primarily due to increased federal and state tax rates applied to the increased net earnings  and an increased valuation reserve on the operating losses of the company s french subsidiary 
in  and  the valuation reserves were increased by million  million and million  respectively  due to continued realization uncertainties for foreign net operating loss carryforwards in france 
the increases in the reserves were recorded as additional tax expense  which significantly increased the company s effective rates over historic averages 
at december   the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards at certain european subsidiaries totaling million  of which million related to the french subsidiary 
the carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods  which can be used to offset future taxable income at these locations 
net earnings and earnings per share as a result of the above mentioned items  net earnings were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share were  and  respectively  for the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million  an increase of million  or 
the increase was the net result of increased net earnings  reduced inventory levels and the timing of payments of certain current liabilities  offset by increased receivables 
cash provided by operations in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease was the net result of a million payment to the pension plan  increases in receivables and inventory levels  and reduced payables  offset somewhat by increased net earnings 
receivables increased between december  and due primarily to higher fourth quarter sales  and an increase in the number of days sales outstanding  offset slightly by the effects of a stronger us dollar 
inventories decreased due primarily to reduced inventory levels at the company s 
table of contents french subsidiary as well as the effect of the stronger us dollar on these balances 
in addition  the inventory levels at december  were higher than desired due to the introduction of new products and longer lead times for electronic components 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
included in capital expenditures for is approximately million related to the purchase of a facility in germany that will be remodeled for occupation in early and million for land in mexico for a new plant that is scheduled for completion in the company expects to spend approximately million on the construction of these new facilities in in addition to its normal level of capital expenditures 
the company believes capacity exists to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures after the completion of these facilities 
prepaid pension increased million at the end of compared to the same period in this was the result of pension expense of million and a payment of million during assumptions for determining pension liability  expected return on assets and annual expense are reviewed and  if appropriate  adjusted annually 
the impacts of hypothetical changes in certain assumptions are difficult to determine as economic factors can often impact multiple assumptions and inputs at the same time 
the company believes its current assumptions are reasonable 
at december   the market value of the assets in the company s pension plan was million compared to million at december  included in the company s december  prepaid pension balance was million of unrecognized net actuarial losses compared to million at the end of the amount of net goodwill recorded at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the net decrease of million was due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro 
short term debt decreased million in as the company obtained a million five year term loan to replace short term debt  offset by normal scheduled payments 
the increase in payables between years is primarily the result of the timing of purchases 
accrued compensation and employee benefits increased million due to increased incentive costs associated with improved sales and earnings levels 
income and other taxes increased million as a result of the timing of tax payments 
total outstanding long term debt both the current and long term portions increased million as a result of a new million five year term loan  offset by required payments 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is collateralized 
common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due primarily to stock issued in connection with the exercise of stock options and treasury stock issuances 
employee benefit stock increased in due to a new restricted stock program approved by shareholders  offset by a  payment due to shares released as a result of payments made on the badger meter employee savings and stock ownership plan essop loan 
treasury stock increased due to shares repurchased during the year 
badger meter s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity including million of unused credit lines  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and from time to time will convert short term debt into long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company guarantees the debt of the badger meter officers voting trust bmovt  from which the bmovt obtained loans from a bank on behalf of the officers of the company in order to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
the officers loan amounts are collateralized by the company s shares that were purchased with the loans proceeds 
there have been no loans made to officers by the bmovt since july the company has guaranteed million and million of the bmovt s debt at december  and december   respectively 
the current loan matures in april  at which time it is expected to be renewed 
the fair market value of this guarantee at december  continues to be insignificant because the collateral value of the shares exceeds the loan amount 
it is the company s intention 
table of contents to eliminate the bmovt by december   because it no longer fulfills its original purpose of providing officers with loans to purchase common stock 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the company guarantees the outstanding debt of the essop that is recorded in long term debt  offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the loan amount is collateralized by shares of the company s common stock 
payments of  and  in and  respectively  reduced the loan to  at december  the terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal and interest payment due on april  the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands current portion and long term debt interest on current portion and long term debt construction of facilities essop royalty commitments minimum product purchases operating leases other distribution rights and research and development commitments total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  no pension plan contributions are anticipated in and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted 
postretirement medical claims are anticipated to be  in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to several judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the health care reserve for claims incurred  but not reported 
each of these judgmental reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the minimum and maximum amount of anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most appropriate amount within the range based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circum 
table of contents stances 
this method has been used for all years in the presented financials and has been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts varies by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios to the remaining balances 
the calculation for the allowance for obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that includes known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claims ratios for current sales and current warranty trends 
the health care reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in other matters the company believes it is in compliance with the various environmental statutes and regulations to which the company s domestic and international operations are subject 
currently  the company is in the process of resolving issues relative to two landfill sites 
provision has been made for all known settlement costs  which are not material 
the company is a defendant in numerous multi party asbestos lawsuits pending in various states 
these lawsuits assert claims alleging that certain industrial products were manufactured by the defendants and were the cause of injury and harm 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these alleged claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and amr systems for water utilities 
a number of the company s competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
in addition  the market s level of acceptance of the company s newer products may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company s ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  including housing starts in the united states and overall industrial activity 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for amr products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company s control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company s operations 
the company has evaluated its worldwide operations to determine if any risks and uncertainties exist that could severely impact its operations in the near term 
the company does not believe that there are any significant near term risks 
however  the company does rely on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 

table of contents raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include metal or alloys such as bronze  aluminum  stainless steel  cast iron  brass and stellite  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers  specifically european customers  as most other foreign sales are made in us dollars 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
fixed rate debt was principally two us dollar term loans with a and a interest rate and a euro dollar revolving term loan with a interest rate 
for the short term floating rate debt  future annual interest costs will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  before income taxes
