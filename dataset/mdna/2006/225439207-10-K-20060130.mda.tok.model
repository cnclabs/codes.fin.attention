the average return on the company s investments for the year ended october  and was and  respectively 
at october   approximately of the investments were directly invested in mutual funds and were managed by professional money managers 
remaining investments are in managed partnerships that use various strategies to minimize their correlation to stock market movements 
most of the investments are highly liquid and the company believes they represent a responsible approach to cash management 
in the company s opinion  the greatest investment risk is the potential for negative market impact from unexpected  major adverse news 
existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at october  the company had remaining estimated capital requirements of  related to projects in south texas and along the central kansas uplift 
such costs  which include overhead  lease bonuses  land services and d seismic  are expected to be funded over the next to months 
as of october   the company had the following known contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years exclusive license obligation operating lease obligations total at october   the company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements except for the hedging line of credit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because earnings are anticipated to be reinvested in operations  cash dividends are not expected to be paid 
the company has no defined benefit plans and no obligations for post retirement employee benefits 
the company s cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased approximately million for the year ended october  although cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is not a generally accepted accounting principles measure of performance or liquidity  the company believes that it may be useful to an investor in evaluating its performance 
however  investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a 
table of contents substitute for operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  because cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities can be made by adding net income  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  deferred income taxes  the cumulative effect of change in accounting principal and other as in the table below

although product prices are key to the company s ability to operate profitably and to budget capital expenditures  they are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict 
since  the company has periodically hedged the price of a portion of its estimated natural gas production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
hedging transactions typically take the form of forward short positions and collars on the nymex futures market  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
such hedges  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges  do not exceed estimated production volumes  are expected to have reasonable correlation between price movements in the futures market and the cash markets where the company s production is located  and are authorized by the company s board of directors 
hedges are expected to be closed as related production occurs but may be closed earlier if the anticipated downward price movement occurs or if the company believes that the potential for such movement has abated 
the company recognizes all derivatives consisting solely of cash flow hedges on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each period 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and then are reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
amounts reclassified into earnings related to natural gas hedges are included in oil and gas sales 
hedging gains and losses are recognized as adjustments to gas sales as the hedged product is produced 
the company had after tax hedging losses of  in fiscal and after tax hedging losses of  in fiscal any hedge ineffectiveness  which was not material for the three years ended october   is immediately recognized in gas sales 
subsequent to october   the company closed its december and january hedge contracts at expiration mmbtu with an after tax hedging loss of  the company currently has no open hedge positions 

table of contents the company has a hedging line of credit with its bank which is available  at the discretion of the company  to meet margin calls 
to date  the company has not used this facility and maintains it only as a precaution related to possible margin calls 
the maximum credit line is  with interest calculated at the prime rate

oil and gas activities general 
capital spending in totaled  a increase over last year 
during the year the company continued to focus on its two core projects natural gas drilling along the shelf of the northern anadarko basin of oklahoma and application of its patented calliope gas recovery system 
the company has recently expanded into south texas through an exploration program using d seismic to define the vicksburg  frio  queen and wilcox prospects in hidalgo and jim hogg counties and into north central kansas through an exploration program using d seismic to define lansing kansas city oil prospects in graham and sheridan counties 
the company believes that  in combination  its drilling and calliope projects provide an excellent and possibly unique balance for achieving its goal of adding long lived natural gas reserves and production at reasonable costs and risks 
the company will continue to actively pursue adding reserves through its two core projects in fiscal and expects these activities to be a reliable source of reserve additions 
however  the timing and extent of such activities can be dependent on many factors which are beyond the company s control  including but not limited to  the availability of oil field services such as drilling rigs  production equipment and related services and access to wells for application of the company s patented liquid lift system on low pressure gas wells 
the prevailing price of oil and natural gas has a significant affect on demand and  thus  the related cost of such services and wells 
drilling activities 
the company currently drills primarily on its  gross acre inventory located along the northern shelf of the anadarko basin 
during  the company drilled wells in oklahoma with working interests ranging up to 
ten of these wells have been completed as producers 
the wells  which ranged from development to rank wildcat  are located on five different prospects 
drilling expenditures were concentrated on the company s acreage inventory located along the northern shelf of the anadarko basin of 
table of contents oklahoma 
the wells targeted the morrow  oswego and chester formations between  and  feet 
a substantial number of additional wells are anticipated for the area 
drilling is not restricted to the northern anadarko shelf acreage 
the company is generating prospects elsewhere in the northern anadarko basin  in the oklahoma panhandle  north central oklahoma  north central kansas and south texas 
in addition  coal bed methane wells were drilled on acreage in wyoming where the company owns working interests of approximately  and coal bed methane wells were drilled on wyoming acreage where the company owns small royalty interests 
this year the company significantly expanded both the volume and breadth of its exploration program with new projects in south texas and north central kansas 
it is the company s intention to diversify its exploration geographically  scientifically  and in terms of capital  risk and reserve potential 
compared to drilling in oklahoma  the south texas project involves higher costs and greater risks but significantly higher per well reserve potential 
the north central kansas project is geared to oil exploration and has excellent potential to add significant reserves at moderate costs and risks 
both projects are in areas where d seismic is a proven exploration tool and where continuing refinements are providing excellent exploration success 
equally as important  both exploration teams specialize in their respective geographic areas and have been highly successful finding new reserves using d seismic 
as previously discussed  drilling of generated south texas prospects is not covered by the exploration agreement and  therefore  is not a capital requirement under the exploration agreement 
drilling is expected to commence in early the initial four well drilling program will be located in hidalgo and jim hogg counties and wells will range in depth from  to  feet with an estimated total cost ths basis of approximately  completed well costs are estimated to range from  at  feet to  at  feet 
the company is currently evaluating what portion of its after payout interest to retain for direct participation 
the north central kansas project agreement provides for approximately square miles of d seismic to be collected and evaluated and five exploratory wells to be drilled 
completed well costs are estimated to be approximately  drilling will commence after new d seismic shooting and interpretation is completed  which is expected in mid the company replaced of its production 
per unit finding costs were per mcf in gas equivalents excluding start up costs in south texas and north central kansas 
all of the company s oil and natural gas properties are located on shore in the continental united states 
the company s future drilling activities may not be successful  and its overall drilling success rate may change 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
also  the company may not be able to obtain the right to drill in areas where it believes there is significant potential for the company 
calliope gas recovery technology 
the company owns the exclusive right to a patented technology known as the calliope gas recovery system 
calliope can achieve substantially lower flowing bottom hole pressure than conventional production methods because it does not rely on reservoir pressure to lift liquids 
lower bottom hole pressure can translate into recovery of substantial additional natural gas reserves 
calliope has proven to be reliable and flexible over a wide range of applications on wells the company owns and operates 
it has also proven to be consistently successful 
accordingly  the company has recently begun implementing strategies designed to widen the envelope of wells on which calliope should be installed 
realizing calliope s value continues to be a top priority of the company 
the company is focused on three fronts to increase the number of calliope installations expanding the geographic region for purchasing calliope candidate wells from third parties  joint ventures 
table of contents with larger companies  and drilling wells into low pressure gas reservoirs for the purpose of using calliope to recover stranded natural gas reserves 
higher natural gas prices have facilitated a new project to drill wells into low pressure natural gas reservoirs 
many low pressure reservoirs  including abandoned fields  contain substantial stranded natural gas that can be recovered by calliope 
this project is designed to ramp up the number of calliope installations  improve the company s control over monetizing calliope s value  control configuration of wellbores for optimum calliope performance  and broaden the range of reservoirs for calliope applications 
completed well costs are estimated to be approximately  including installation of calliope 
the company expects to commence drilling wells for calliope applications in mid and is considering bringing in industry participants for the project 
as previously reported  joint venture presentations have been made to a range of companies  including several of the major oil and gas companies as well as several large independents 
all of these companies have expressed a keen interest in calliope  and joint venture discussions are continuing with several of those companies  including evaluation of candidate wells 
in addition to joint ventures and the calliope drilling project  the company has successfully expanded its calliope operations into texas and louisiana 
in southwest texas  the company recently completed two prototype calliope installations which once again broadened calliope s down hole application  successfully lifting several times more fluid volume than calliope has previously lifted from the company s oklahoma wells 
although this prototype calliope configuration limits the amount of natural gas that can be produced during the start up and dewatering phase  after initial dewatering and once liquid production stabilizes  the system can be optimized to allow greater natural gas flow 
in louisiana  the company recently completed the purchase of a calliope candidate well in acadia parish 
the well is currently dead and will be evaluated for a calliope installation in the first quarter of these efforts are being spearheaded on a full time basis by a highly qualified petroleum engineer based in houston

the effective tax rate was in and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties  the accounting for oil and natural gas reserves  and the estimate of its asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
capitalized costs included in the full cost pool are depleted on an aggregate basis using the units of production method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of oil and natural gas properties 
a change in proved reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will cause the depletion rate to increase or decrease 
both the volume of proved reserves and any estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are based on estimates such as those described under oil and gas reserves below 
the capitalized costs in the full cost pool are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the company has made only one ceiling write down in its year history 
that write down was made in after oil prices fell and natural gas prices fell between fiscal year end and changes in oil and natural gas prices have historically had the most significant impact on the company s ceiling test 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
even though oil and natural gas prices can be highly volatile over weeks and even days  the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the test period be 
table of contents used and held constant 
the resulting valuation is a snapshot as of that day and  thus  is generally not indicative of a true fair value that would be placed on the company s reserves by the company or by an independent third party 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on the company s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the test period 
oil and gas reserves 
the determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well as ceiling test write downs related to the recorded value of the company s oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves 
the company s reserves  and reserve values  are concentrated in properties significant properties 
some of the significant properties are individual wells and others are multi well properties 
at october   the significant properties represent of the company s total properties but a disproportionate of the discounted value at of the company s reserves 
individual wells on which the company s patented liquid lift system is installed comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted reserve value of such properties 
relatively new wells comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted value of such properties 
estimates of reserve quantities and values for certain significant properties must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 
such properties include wells with limited production histories and properties with proved undeveloped or proved non producing reserves 
in addition  the company s patented liquid lift system is generally installed on mature wells 
as such  they contain older down hole equipment that is more subject to failure than new equipment 
the failure of such equipment  particularly casing  can result in complete loss of a well 
historically  performance of the company s wells has not caused significant revisions in its proved reserves 
price changes will affect the economic lives of oil and gas properties and  therefore  price changes may cause reserve revisions 
price changes have not caused significant proved reserve revisions by the company except in when a decline in oil prices and a decline in natural gas prices resulted in an reduction in estimated proved reserves 
based upon this historical experience  the company does not believe its reserve estimates are particularly sensitive to prices changes within historical ranges 
one measure of the life of the company s proved reserves can be calculated by dividing proved reserves at fiscal year end by production for fiscal year this measure yields an average reserve life of nine years 
since this measure is an average  by definition  some of the company s properties will have a life shorter than the average and some will have a life longer than the average 
the expected economic lives of the company s properties may vary widely depending on  among other things  the size and quality  natural gas and oil prices  possible curtailments in consumption by purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
as a result  the company s actual future net cash flows from proved reserves could be materially different from its estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the company estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future abandonment costs  inflation  market risk premiums  useful life  and cost of capital 
the nature of these estimates requires the company to make judgments based on historical experience and future 
table of contents expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis
