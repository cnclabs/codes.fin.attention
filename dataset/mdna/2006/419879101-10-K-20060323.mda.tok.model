item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview our company hawaiian holdings is a holding company whose primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of hawaiian 
based on the total number of miles flown by revenue passengers in  hawaiian is the largest airline headquartered in hawaii and the sixteenth largest domestic airline in the us hawaiian offers daily scheduled service on transpacific routes between hawaii and los angeles  sacramento  san diego  san francisco  san jose  las vegas  phoenix  portland  and seattle  daily service among the hawaiian islands  additional scheduled service to australia  american samoa and tahiti and unscheduled charter services 
hawaiian was originally incorporated in january under the laws of the territory of hawaii and became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company pursuant to a corporate restructuring that was consummated in august hawaiian became a delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the company in june pursuant to a short form merger described in greater detail below under consummation of hawaiian s joint plan of reorganization 
based in honolulu  hawaiian had  active employees as of december  while hawaiian s operations and financial results are affected by a variety of factors  hawaiian  like all airlines  is particularly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel 
fuel costs are volatile and constitute a significant portion of hawaiian s operating expenses  representing approximately  and of hawaiian s operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on gallons expected to be consumed in  every one cent change in the cost per gallon of jet fuel increases or decreases hawaiian s annual fuel expense by approximately million 
consummation of the joint plan of reorganization on march   hawaiian filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of hawaii 
holdings did not file for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on may   a bankruptcy trustee was selected to serve in connection with the chapter filing and operate hawaiian  which thereafter operated its business under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and orders of the bankruptcy court until june   the effective date of hawaiian s joint plan of reorganization 
the bankruptcy filing and subsequent appointment of the bankruptcy trustee effectively served to divest operational and financial control of hawaiian from the company s officers and directors  and severed the availability of funds needed to support the company s efforts to meet its ongoing financial and other obligations  including the company s reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
on march   we  together with the bankruptcy trustee  the unsecured creditors of hawaiian  hhic  inc hhic  and rc aviation sponsored the third amended joint plan of reorganization the joint plan to provide for hawaiian to emerge from bankruptcy 
the joint plan provided for payment in full of all allowed claims  including unsecured claims 
the joint plan also provided for the merger of hawaiian airlines  inc  a hawaii corporation  with and into hhic  with hhic as the surviving entity and immediately changing its name to hawaiian airlines  inc  a delaware corporation 
as used in this report  the term hawaiian refers to the predecessor company for all periods prior to the hhic merger and the successor company for all periods subsequent to the hhic merger 
we retained our equity interest in hawaiian  however  in connection with the joint plan  we issued shares of our common stock to creditors of hawaiian to help fund the joint plan  resulting in a dilution of the ownership interest of our common shareholders 
the joint plan was consummated on june  as described further below under liquidity and capital resources  the joint plan was financed through our issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock to the holders of aircraft lease related claims  a million senior secured credit facility of hawaiian  a million junior secured term loan of hawaiian and a private placement by the company of million in subordinated convertible notes collectively  the exit financing transactions 
results of operations our operations and financial results are sensitive to seasonal volatility  primarily due to leisure and holiday travel patterns 
hawaii is a popular vacation destination for travelers 
traffic levels are typically weaker in the first quarter of the year with stronger travel periods occurring during june  july  august and december 
during weaker travel periods  we may adjust our flight availability to obtain a profitable passenger load factor  or utilize aggressive fare pricing strategies to increase our traffic volume  which may involve higher ticket discounts during these periods 
our results of operations generally reflect this seasonality  but are also impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal 
these factors include the extent and nature of fare changes and competition from other airlines  changing levels of operations  national and international events  fuel prices and general economic conditions  including inflation and employment levels 
because substantial portions of personal and business airline travel are discretionary  the industry tends to experience adverse financial results in general economic downturns 
in the transpacific market  most of hawaiian s competition has come from full service legacy air carriers such as american airlines  united airlines  continental airlines  delta air lines and northwest airlines 
united airlines  which currently provides the most air service between the us mainland and hawaii  emerged from bankruptcy in february  and delta air lines and northwest airlines have both been operating under the protection of us bankruptcy laws since september  hawaiian has in the past been largely insulated from direct competition from low cost carriers or lccs 
most lccs have lacked the fleet and infrastructure necessary to provide long haul trans oceanic service 
the hawaii market has  however  in recent years  seen growing lcc competition from aloha and ata  which increased service to hawaii from san francisco and other cities in  and us airways which commenced service to hawaii at the end of we also face the threat of more lcc competition in the future 
furthermore  a more fundamental and immediate consequence for us of the proliferation of lccs is the response from full service legacy airlines  who are meeting the competition from lccs by significantly reducing costs and adjusting their route networks to divert resources to long haul markets such as hawaii  where lcc competition is less severe 
the result is that the legacy airlines have at the same time reduced their costs of operation and increased capacity in the hawaii market 
additional capacity to hawaii  whether from legacy airlines or lccs  could result in a decrease in our share of the transpacific market  a decline in our transpacific yields  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in the interisland market  we currently face competition principally from two other airlines  aloha airlines which was recapitalized upon its emergence from bankruptcy in february and island air 
additionally  mesa airlines  a regional air carrier based in phoenix  arizona  has announced its plans to begin flying an interisland schedule with up to six seat regional jets sometime in the second quarter of the additional interisland capacity planned by mesa airlines together with the improved competitive position of the recapitalized aloha airlines could have a significant negative impact on our interisland yields and ultimately our financial condition 
prior to the commencement of hawaiian s bankruptcy proceeding in march  we consolidated hawaiian 
following hawaiian s bankruptcy filing  effective april   we deconsolidated hawaiian and prospectively accounted for our ownership interest in hawaiian using the cost method of accounting 
our results of operations  therefore  do not include hawaiian s operating results during the period from april  through june  during this period  we generated no operating revenue  and our operating expenses consisted almost entirely of legal and professional fees related to hawaiian s chapter case  other legal and accounting fees  and other corporate expenses 
those expenses were million and million  respectively  for the period april  through december  and the year ended december   and million for the period january  through june   prior to the reacquisition of hawaiian 
on june   the effective date of hawaiian s joint plan of reorganization  we reconsolidated hawaiian as of such date for financial reporting purposes 
hawaiian s emergence from bankruptcy has been accounted for as a business combination the acquisition of hawaiian by us  with the assets and liabilities of hawaiian recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair value as of june   and the results of operations of hawaiian included in our consolidated results of operations from june  however  given the significance of hawaiian s results of operations to our future results of operations and financial condition  as well as the extremely limited nature of our operations during the periods we deconsolidated hawaiian  our historical results of operations and hawaiian have been combined for the years ended december   and and are discussed below in order to provide a more informative comparison of results for those years

the combined entity s results of operations for the period june  through december  were affected by the application of purchase accounting upon the reacquisition of hawaiian by holdings 
the assets and liabilities of hawaiian were recorded at fair value as of june  the changes in the book values of hawaiian s assets and liabilities as of june  affected the combined entity s income before income taxes as follows from that date through december  period june  through december  in thousands increase decrease in income before income taxes passenger revenue elimination of deferred revenue from sales of miles in frequent flyer program wages and benefits elimination of unamortized actuarial losses on benefit plans aircraft and other rent expense amortization of unfavorable operating lease liability depreciation and amortization of property and equipment adjust property and equipment to fair value amortization of intangible assets favorable aircraft and spare aircraft engine leases recognized as a component of aircraft rent favorable aircraft maintenance contracts recognized as a component of maintenance materials and repairs other intangible assets recognized as a component of depreciation and amortization total amortization of intangible assets net decrease in operating income interest expense amortization of debt discount due to recognizing debt obligation at fair value interest income accretion due to recognizing aircraft maintenance and lease security deposits at fair value total net decrease in income before income taxes for the purposes of the following discussion  the term the combined entity refers to the combined results of operations of holdings and hawaiian 
as used in the context of this narrative  holdings and hawaiian refer to hawaiian holdings  inc and hawaiian airlines  inc 
in their individual capacities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the combined entity incurred a net loss of million and had operating income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million and operating income of million for the comparable period in operating income decreased by million in  or  compared to due primarily to increases in in fuel  depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses  whereas the net loss incurred in decreased by million principally because of million of nonoperating expenses incurred in related to hawaiian s bankruptcy and reorganization 
other significant differences between income and expense items for the years ended december  and are discussed below 
operating revenue 
operating revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase over operating revenue of million in as discussed above  the application of purchase accounting upon the reacquisition of hawaiian by holdings on june  resulted in a non cash decrease of approximately million in operating revenue in other significant year over year changes leading to the increase in operating revenue are discussed below 
scheduled passenger revenue was million in compared to scheduled passenger revenue of million in this million  or  increase in scheduled passenger revenue was due to improved traffic in all of hawaiian s markets as is shown in the table immediately below reflecting strong demand for travel to and from hawaii and positive customer response to hawaiian s service levels and operational performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  change in scheduled passenger change in change in change in revenue yield rpm asm millions transpacific south pacific interisland total scheduled other operating revenue was million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in the million  or  increase in other operating revenue was due primarily to increases of million in charter revenue  due in turn to a increase in charter revenue block hours operated  and million in other operating revenue due primarily to increases in ground handling services provided to other airlines  ticket change fees  and commissions and fees earned under certain joint marketing agreements with other companies 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december   a million increase from operating expenses of million for the prior year 
the net increase in operating expenses in was due primarily to increases in aircraft fuel and maintenance  depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 
as discussed above  the application of purchase accounting upon the reacquisition of hawaiian by holdings on june  resulted in an increase of approximately million in non cash operating expenses in change from year ended year ended percent december  december  change in thousands operating expenses wages and benefits a aircraft fuel  including taxes and oil b aircraft rent maintenance materials and repairs c other rentals and landing fees depreciation and amortization d sales commissions e other f total a the increase in wages and benefits for was due primarily to million of compensation expense associated with  shares of holdings common stock granted  or to be granted  to hawaiian s employees under the hawaiian airlines  inc stock bonus plan for services provided through december  expenses related to employee benefits decreased by million in compared to due primarily to revaluations of hawaiian s pension and postretirement benefits obligations at june  other net increases in salaries and wages  principally for hawaiian s afa employees  contributed to the overall net increase in wages and benefits expense in compared to hawaiian currently has contracts with its three largest organized labor groups  alpa  afa and iam  through june   november  and march   respectively  when these contracts next become amendable 
b the increase in fuel expense was due mostly to a increase to an average of per gallon for the cost of jet fuel in compared to an average of per gallon for jet fuel in the average cost of jet fuel in and includes hedging losses of million and gains of million  respectively  and fuel related taxes 
additionally  overall increases in flight operations in particularly in the long haul transpacific and south pacific markets lead to an approximate increase in fuel consumed in compared to the prior year 
c the increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense was due primarily to increased expenses incurred for the major airframe maintenance of certain older aircraft and one aircraft engine  and to the inclusion of additional aircraft engines under a power by hour maintenance contract under which fees are assessed on the hours the engines subject to this contract are utilized 
also  hawaiian operated approximately thousand  or  more revenue block hours in than in  which increased aircraft utilization contributed to the overall year over year increase in aircraft maintenance 
maintenance expense in also included million of amortization expense attributable to favorable aircraft maintenance contracts recognized at june  we expect aircraft maintenance expenses to continue to increase in subsequent years due to a variety of factors such as the aging of our fleet  additional fleet utilization  the growth of our fleet and increased costs for related materials and services 
d the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due almost entirely to the amortization of certain intangible assets recorded upon the reacquisition of hawaiian by holdings at june  future depreciation expense will be affected by the addition in of four owned aircraft and related spare rotable parts 
e the increase in sales commissions expense was due in part to increases in passenger revenues and to incentives paid to certain travel agencies to promote hawaiian s service to sydney  australia  which service began in may to minimize commission expenses in the future  we will continue efforts to increase passenger sales through our own reservations agents and website and other internet channels 
f the increase in other operating expense was due primarily to professional fees relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  hawaiian s reorganization  and other financial accounting and auditing services 
nonoperating income and expense 
net nonoperating income was million for the year ended december   compared to net nonoperating expense of million for the same period in the year ended december  included a million gain related to the portion of the change in fair value of hawaiian s jet fuel forward contracts excluded from hedge effectiveness  realized and unrealized gains of million related to jet fuel forward contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting  interest income of million  offset by interest expense of million due primarily to the indebtedness incurred to fund the joint plan and million loss on repurchase of million notes 
the year included net reorganization expenses of million arising primarily from allowed claims related to affirmed and rejected aircraft leases  and rejected firm orders for aircraft 
income tax expense 
combined income tax expense was million for the year ended december   a million  or  increase from combined income tax expense of million for the comparable period in it is important to note that the combined income tax provision reflects the separate company income tax expense incurred by holdings and hawaiian and is not reflective of the income tax expense that would have resulted had holdings and hawaiian filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented or had holdings consolidated hawaiian during the periods presented 
the combined provision for income taxes for is significantly in excess of the million expected tax expense  based on the combined federal and state statutory rates applicable to the company  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the combined provision for income taxes of million is also significantly in excess of the income taxes that we expect to pay for the primary factor driving the tax rate is a significant increase in book tax timing differences 
these differences result in higher taxable income on the company s tax returns  while the offsetting deferred tax asset representing the value of the future tax deduction when the timing differences turn and are recognized in our tax returns must be fully offset by a valuation allowance given our history of operating losses and hawaiian s recent bankruptcy 
the impact of these book tax timing differences was dramatically increased by the application of purchase accounting upon hawaiian s emergence from bankruptcy on june   which resulted in fair value adjustments to the book basis of hawaiian s assets and liabilities  but had no impact on the corresponding tax basis in those assets and liabilities 
furthermore  while the consummation of the joint plan triggered significant tax deductions related to the payment of the lease deficiency claims of hawaiian  the benefit of those deductions was recorded as a reduction to goodwill  not the provision for income taxes  because the deductions related to transactions originally occurring prior to the point at which hawaiian was consolidated by the company 
nevertheless  these deductions did serve to reduce our income taxes payable for by approximately million 
we expect these book tax timing differences to continue to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate for as well  although not to the magnitude experienced in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   the combined entity had a net loss of million on operating income of million  and a net loss of million on operating income of million for the year ended december  despite a million year over year increase in operating revenue  increases in operating and nonoperating expenses and income taxes totaling million resulted in the increased net loss for compared to the prior year 
operating revenue 
operating revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to operating revenue of million for the significant year over year changes leading to this net increase in operating revenue are discussed below 
scheduled passenger revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to scheduled passenger revenue of million for  a million  or  increase year over year 
as shown in the table below  the increase in revenue was due to overall improvements in revenue passenger miles operated and yield realized which increased revenue by million and million  respectively  compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  change in scheduled change in change in change in passenger revenue yield rpm asm millions transpacific interisland south pacific total scheduled other operating revenues were million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in the approximate million  or  net decrease in other operating revenues in was due almost entirely to a decrease of million in charter revenue compared to such revenue earned in due in part to the reallocation of aircraft to scheduled service principally for the purpose of initiating service to sydney  australia in may and the absence of military charters in which charters generated approximately million of operating revenue in  charter revenue block hours operated in decreased by  hours  or  from  and charter revenue per revenue block hour in decreased by to thousand per revenue block hour compared to the prior year 
cargo revenue and other miscellaneous operating revenues earned in such as ground handling services provided to other airlines  ticket change fees  and commissions and fees earned under certain joint marketing agreements with other companies was essentially unchanged from such operating revenues earned in operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december   a million  or  increase from operating expenses of million for as is discussed more fully below  the net increase in the operating expenses was due primarily to increases in aircraft fuel  wages and benefits and other operating expenses 
also  operating expenses for were reduced by million for financial assistance received from the federal government 
change from year year ended ended percent december  december  change in thousands operating expenses wages and benefits a aircraft fuel  including taxes and oil b aircraft rent c maintenance materials and repairs other rentals and landing fees depreciation and amortization d sales commissions e special credits f other g total a the increase in wages and benefits expense was due to increases of million in employee benefits  including pension and postretirement  medical  and workers compensation expenses  and million in wages for iam and non contract employees  offset somewhat by savings of million in flight crew wages associated primarily with a reduction in the number of our and dc pilots 
wages and benefits expense in also included million of employee bonuses based on operating profit  whereas wages and benefits expenses included a million management incentive bonus and million employee bonuses based on operating profit 
b the increase in aircraft fuel expense was due almost entirely to a increase to an average of per gallon for the cost of jet fuel for  as year over year fuel consumption was essentially flat 
aircraft fuel expense included gains of million and million  respectively  in and related to hawaiian s fuel hedging programs in effect during those periods see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of our fuel hedging programs 
c the decrease in aircraft rent expense was due primarily to the early return of two leased aircraft  one each in december and january  and to a lesser degree to renegotiated lease rates for our other leased and aircraft 
d the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of certain capitalized airframe and engine overhauls which began in april  and an increase in the depreciation of ground service equipment 
these capitalized airframe and engine overhauls were determined to have no fair value upon our reacquisition of hawaiian on june  additionally  our accounting policy states that such future airframe and engine overhauls will be charged to expense as they are incurred 
e the increase in sales commissions expense was due in part to the increase in scheduled passenger revenue in compared to the prior year  and to incentives paid to certain travel agencies to promote service to sydney  australia  which service began in may f operating expenses for the year ended december  were reduced by million for financial assistance received from the federal government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act for reimbursement of previously expensed airline security fees 
no such financial assistance was received or recognized in g the increase in was due principally to increases in outside services purchased including legal  technical and other professional fees of million  and advertising and promotional expense of million  offset by all other operating expenses  net of million 
nonoperating income and expense 
nonoperating expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from nonoperating expense of million for primarily all of the increase in was due to increases in reorganization related expenses as follows year ended december  change change millions lease claims professional fees other  net total income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from income tax expense of million for despite pretax losses in and  book tax timing and permanent differences resulted in income taxes payable for those two years 
although the book tax timing differences result in deferred tax assets representing the value of the future tax deduction when the timing differences turn and are recognized in our tax returns  these assets must be fully offset by a valuation allowance given hawaiian s history of operating losses and bankruptcy 
as a result  the provision for income taxes for both years approximates the taxes expected to be paid for the year 
the increase in is primarily due to that year s current liability for federal and state income taxes resulting principally from permanent and timing differences associated with the increased reorganization expenses in compared to  which are generally not deductible for income tax purposes until paid 
combined income tax expense reflects the separate company income tax expense incurred by holdings and hawaiian and is not reflective of the income tax expense that would have resulted had holdings and hawaiian filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources our future liquidity will be dependent largely on the operating results and cash flows of hawaiian  along with the financing arrangements put in place in connection with the effectiveness of the joint plan  as discussed below and at note  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
additionally  we agreed on march  with certain of the lenders who participated in funding the joint plan and certain additional lenders to increase the term loans under our senior credit facility and term b credit facility by approximately million in the aggregate 
hawaiian s credit facilities now consist of million of term loans a million term loan under the senior credit facility and a million term loan under the term b credit facility and a million revolving line of credit  each of which is described in greater detail below 
proceeds from the additional amount borrowed will be used to redeem our outstanding subordinated convertible notes due  to fund the retrofit of the four boeing aircraft acquired by hawaiian in the first quarter of  and to acquire certain additional assets 
the amended credit facilities provide for million of the financing proceeds to be held in a restricted account  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
of this amount  million will be used  once unrestricted  to redeem the company s subordinated convertible notes  the terms of which are described in greater detail below 
the company expects the conditions as they relate to this million to be met late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter  and for the subordinated convertible notes to be redeemed shortly thereafter 
the remaining million will remain in escrow subject to the acquisition of specific assets by hawaiian  which  if acquired  would provide additional collateral to the lenders 
if this asset acquisition does not occur by july   the remaining million will be returned to the term b lenders  and the term b principal will be reduced commensurately 
senior credit facility the senior credit facility provides hawaiian with a variable interest rate million senior secured credit facility comprised of i a revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million  subject to availability under a borrowing base formula based on certain of hawaiian s eligible assets as defined in the agreement  with million sub limits for letters of credit and million in swing loans  and ii a year  month million term loan with principal amortization of million per quarter and the balance being due at the maturity of the facility on december  indebtedness under the senior credit facility bears interest  in the case of base rate loans  at a per annum rate equal to the base rate wells fargo s established prime rate plus the base rate margin basis points and  in the case of libor rate loans  at a per annum rate equal to the three month libor rate plus basis points 
however  at no time during the term of the senior credit facility will the interest rate be less than per annum 
the senior credit facility includes customary covenants for lending transactions of this type including minimum cash  ebitda  excess availability and leverage ratio financial covenants 
indebtedness under the senior credit facility is secured by first and  in some cases  junior liens on substantially all of hawaiian s tangible and certain of its intangible assets 
hawaiian had issued million of letters of credit and had million of remaining availability under the existing credit facility as of december  term b credit facility the term b credit facility provides hawaiian with an additional million five year term loan at an interest rate of per annum  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the entire principal amount of the loan may be prepaid  subject to certain prepayment premiums as set forth in the term b credit facility 
the term b credit facility includes customary covenants for lending transactions of this type  including minimum ebitda  excess availability and leverage ratio financial covenants 
the term b credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of hawaiian  subject to the prior liens granted to the senior lenders under the senior credit facility 
in conjunction with the establishment of the revised term b credit facility  we issued to the term b lenders or their affiliates  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share  the last  of which becomes exercisable after the final million of proceeds become available to hawaiian as described above 
the warrants contain a forced conversion feature allowing us to force conversion of the warrants anytime after the average closing price of our common stock is at or above per share for consecutive calendar days 
subordinated convertible notes on june   we and rc aviation entered into an agreement pursuant to which rc aviation and its members purchased from us the series a subordinated convertible notes due june  the series a notes and series b subordinated convertible notes due june  the series b notes and  together with the series a notes  the notes  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes provide for interest at a rate of per annum  payable in cash or additional notes at our option 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain dilutive events 
the notes were initially convertible into  shares of our common stock at any time after the first anniversary of the issuance of the notes 
the notes become due five years from the issue date  or june   if not prepaid or converted prior to such date 
we have the right  and will use our best efforts  to redeem the notes prior to the first anniversary of issuance at of the aggregate principal amount  plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and payable thereunder  at any time 
on june   rc aviation also received a warrant to purchase shares of our newly designated series e preferred stock 
in july  that warrant was automatically exchanged for a warrant to purchase up to of our fully diluted shares of common stock or  shares as of that date at an exercise price of per share the common stock warrant 
one half of the common stock warrant was earned by rc aviation for its funding commitment with respect to the joint plan and the other half was earned by rc aviation in connection with its purchase of the notes 
on october   november   and november   we repurchased approximately million  million and million  respectively  in principal amount of the notes at their face amount  plus accrued interest  and corresponding portions of the common stock warrant 
after giving effect to the warrant repurchases in connection with the note repurchases  rc aviation now holds a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
due to the significance of the operating cash flows of hawaiian to our future liquidity  our historical sources and uses of cash have been combined with those of hawaiian and discussed below in order to provide a more informative comparison 
we currently believe that the combination of our existing cash  the cash flows from hawaiian s operations and our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the end of hawaiian holdings  inc and hawaiian airlines  inc 
condensed combined statements of cash flows unaudited year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities before reorganization activities net cash used in reorganization activities net cash provided by operating activities cash flows from investing activities additions to property and equipment net cash used in investing activities cash flows from financing activities proceeds from issuance of common stock proceeds from exercise of stock options repurchase of subordinated convertible notes and warrants repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period cash and cash equivalents end of period our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   an increase of million from cash and cash equivalents of million for the combined entity as of december  our restricted cash was million as of december   an increase of million from restricted cash of million for the combined entity as of december  the restricted cash primarily serves as collateral to support credit card holdbacks for advance passenger ticket sales  which funds are made available to us as the related air travel is provided 
historically  hawaiian s cash flow from operations is higher in the second and third quarters of the year and lower in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to reduced travel demand in the latter two quarters except for specific periods around holidays and spring break 
working capital as of december  was million compared to working capital of million as of december  net cash provided by the combined entity s operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in reorganization activities used million less cash in the period compared to the same period in  due primarily to hawaiian s emergence from bankruptcy on june  the million period over period increase in net cash provided by operating activities before reorganization activities was due primarily to an increase in air traffic liability 
investing activities in used million more in cash than in the prior year due entirely to acquisitions of property and equipment  and we expect significantly higher capital expenditures in principally due to the acquisitions of and modifications and improvements to the four boeing aircraft discussed below 
financing activities used net cash of million in  compared to million provided by financing activities in  the difference in being due primarily to the debt service of long term note and lease obligations and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock 
at december   the combined entity had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the combined entity also had restricted cash on those dates of million and million  respectively  comprised substantially of credit card holdbacks 
operating activities provided net cash of million in and million in reorganization activities used cash of million in and million in the primary source of cash from operating activities before reorganization activities in both and was operating income resulting from increases in passenger revenue 
operating income in also included million of financial assistance received from the federal government under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
investing and financing activities used net cash of million in and million in primarily for the acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash from investing and financing activities in included million from the sales of common stock in that year 
hawaiian sponsors three tax qualified defined benefit pension plans covering its alpa  iam  twu  neg and certain non contract employees 
in the aggregate  these plans are underfunded 
as of december   the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately million 
hawaiian made scheduled contributions of million for and anticipates contributing million to the defined benefit pension plans during future funding requirements are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates  funding status  applicable regulatory requirements for funding purposes and the level and timing of asset returns 
on february  and march   hawaiian purchased four boeing aircraft for a total purchase price of approximately million 
we estimate that our capital expenditures in will be approximately million exclusive of the purchase of the aforementioned aircraft 
anticipated capital expenditures include modifications and overhauls of the recently acquired aircraft for entry into service  upgrades and enhancements to our information technology systems and improvements and modifications to certain of our airport terminal and other facilities 
the majority of these anticipated capital expenditures are not firm commitments  and therefore we can adjust the level of our capital spending based on our then current and projected available cash 
we may also acquire additional aircraft from time to time as opportunities arise to both i acquire the aircraft on satisfactory price and financing terms  and ii deploy them in appropriate markets 
other than the acquisition of the four aircraft discussed above  we currently do not have any firm commitments to acquire additional aircraft 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has i made guarantees  ii retained a contingent interest in transferred assets  iii an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or iv any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities related to certain airport leases 
our airport leases are typically with municipalities or other governmental entities 
to the extent our leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity  we are not the primary beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease  and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or similar feature 
contractual obligations our estimated contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table in thousands contractual obligations and contractual obligations total thereafter senior credit facility term b credit facility series a and b notes notes payable to irs other debt capital lease obligations operating leases aircraft and related equipment operating leases non aircraft projected employee benefit contributions total contractual obligations amounts represent contractual amounts due  including interest 
interest on floating rate debt was estimated using projected forward rates as of the fourth quarter of as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  in march  we agreed to the restructuring of these credit facilities such that the availability under these agreements was increased to million and the total outstanding balance was increased to million 
amounts represent contractual amounts due  including interest 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we plan to redeem the series a and b notes in march or early in the second quarter of amounts represent long term obligations payable to the irs for settlement of certain pre and post petition tax claims 
amounts represent minimum lease payments due under the respective lease agreements 
we have assumed no escalations in rents that are contingent in nature 
amounts represent our estimate of the minimum funding requirements under the erisa  assuming passage of senate bill s 
for plan years beginning in amounts are subject to change based on numerous factors  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  and the impact of proposed legislation 
we are unable to estimate the projected contributions beyond total contractual obligations do not include long term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature  such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power by the hour  computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements  or when the agreements contain short term cancellation provisions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition 
passenger revenue is recognized either when the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused 
the value of unused passenger tickets is included as air traffic liability 
any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of this estimated liability  which can be significant  are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed 
charter and cargo revenue are recognized when the transportation is provided 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas and its other postretirement benefit plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
under both sfas and sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
expense calculated under sfas and sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
the calculation of pension and other postretirement benefit expense requires the use of a number of significant assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we assumed that the assets in hawaiian s plans would generate a long term rate of return of at june   the date we reacquired hawaiian and recorded its pension obligation at its fair value  and december  the expected long term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans assets  including the trustee s review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the plan strives to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
our allocation of assets was as follows at december  percent of total expected long term rate of return us equities international equities fixed income other total we believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the pension plan s investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by one percent from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
we discounted our future pension and other postretirement benefit obligation using a discount rate of at june   the date we reacquired hawaiian and recorded its pension obligation at its fair value  and at december  we determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
the pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by one percent would increase our pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities at december  by approximately million and million  respectively  decrease our estimated pension expense by approximately million and increase our estimated other post retirement benefit expense by approximately million 
at december   the health care cost trend rate was assumed to be for and decrease gradually to over eight years and remain level thereafter 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the other post retirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and our estimated other post retirement benefit expense by approximately million 
a one percent decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease the accumulated retiree medical benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and our estimated other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  plan provisions  assumed discount rates  pension funding legislation and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future retirement benefit expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
embedded financial instruments 
warrants issued in connection with debt financings are accounted for in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  where the portion of the proceeds allocable to the warrants is treated as additional paid in capital 
the allocation between the debt and additional paid in capital is based on the relative fair values of the two securities at time of issuance 
the resulting debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the life of the debt instrument 
for purposes of valuing the common stock warrant issued in june  we utilized the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the most critical assumption used in developing the fair value of the common stock warrant is the expected volatility of the company s stock 
because the historic volatility of our common stock is not a reliable indicator of future volatility due to hawaiian s bankruptcy and the thin liquidity for our common stock during that period  we utilized a stock volatility factor based on a peer comparison group for a period of time approximating the term of the common stock warrant  which resulted in an expected volatility of 
the value ascribed to the common stock warrant as capital in excess of par value in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  was million after giving effect to the cancellation of  warrants associated with the repurchases in the fourth quarter of of million par value of the series a and series b notes 
raising or lowering the expected volatility by ten percentage points would have increased or decreased annualized interest expense by million 
additionally  convertibility features within debt instruments are evaluated under emerging issues task force consensus  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  whereby an in the money nondetachable conversion feature at the commitment date a beneficial conversion feature is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that beneficial conversion feature to additional paid in capital 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion is calculated as the difference between the conversion price  adjusted for the fair value allocated to warrants described above  and the fair value of the common stock or other securities into which the security is convertible multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible 
the amount recorded as additional capital in excess of par value in the accompanying balance sheet at december  for the beneficial conversion feature was million and was not affected by the million of repurchases of the series a and b notes in the fourth quarter of as the per share market prices of our common stock as of the dates of such repurchases was less than the per share conversion price provided for in the notes 
the resulting debt discount associated with the beneficial conversion feature is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt instrument 
as a result of the amounts ascribed to the beneficial conversion feature in the notes and the common stock warrant issued in connection therewith  the notes are recorded at a substantial discount  which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes at december  the carrying value of the notes at december  was million  and the effective interest rate on the notes was over the remaining life of the notes at that date 
if the notes are retired prior to their june  maturity date  or if additional early repurchases of the notes are made  the effective interest rate on the carrying value of the remaining notes will likely change from the rate of in effect as of december  we plan to redeem the notes before june  in connection with this redemption  we estimate that we will record a one time charge due of approximately million due to the accelerated recognition of the debt discount and issuance costs recorded on and associated with the notes 
derivative financial instruments 
we have adopted a comprehensive fuel hedging program that provides us with flexibility of utilizing certain derivative financial instruments  such as heating oil forward contracts and jet fuel forward contracts to manage market risks and hedge our financial exposure to fluctuations in our aircraft fuel costs 
heating oil forward contracts and or jet fuel forward contracts are utilized to hedge a portion of our anticipated aircraft fuel needs 
at december   we had hedged approximately of our anticipated aircraft fuel needs for we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
such instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
to the extent a company complies with the hedge documentation requirements and can demonstrate a highly effective hedge  both at the designation of the hedge and throughout the life of the hedge  such derivatives are recorded at fair value with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of hedge ineffectiveness 
such amounts are recognized as a component of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is used 
the ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of the forward contracts is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of nonoperating income loss 
we designated the effectiveness of our jet fuel forward contracts based on the changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot prices  the change in fair value related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price ie  the spot forward difference are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as a result  any changes in the spot forward difference are immediately recognized into earnings as a component of other nonoperating income expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in nonoperating income related to spot forward changes 
derivatives that are not hedges  or for situations where we have not met the stringent documentation requirements of sfas  such derivatives must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we measure fair value of our derivatives based on quoted values provided by the counterparty 
upon our acquisition of hawaiian and through august   the documentation requirements for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas were not met  and therefore changes in the fair value of the jet fuel forward contracts on approximately of our fuel consumption were reported through earnings 
as of september   we had completed the required documentation and designated the jet fuel forward contracts as cash flow hedges under sfas impairment of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations  primarily property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent management s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we provide an allowance for spare parts inventory obsolescence over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess 
these allowances are based on estimates and industry trends  which are subject to change  and  where available  reference to market rates and transactions 
the estimates are more sensitive near the end of a fleet life or when entire fleets are removed from service sooner than originally planned 
goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives  all of which relate to the acquisition of hawaiian  for impairment annually and or whenever events or changes in applicable circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of the hawaiian reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the hawaiian reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required to be performed 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the hawaiian reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the hawaiian reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
sfas also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions management believes to be reasonable but are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed the carrying values of goodwill and the intangible asset associated with the fair value of hawaiian s trade name pursuant to the applicable provisions of sfas no 
and have concluded that such carrying values were not impaired as of december  frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for the hawaiianmiles frequent flyer program that are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that includes the costs of fuel  meals and beverages  and certain other passenger traffic related costs  but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership and maintenance 
hawaiian sells mileage credits in the hawaiianmiles frequent flyer program to participating partners such as hotels  car rental agencies and credit card companies 
revenue from the sale of mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on the fair value of the transportation to be provided 
amounts in excess of the fair value of the transportation to be provided are recognized immediately as a reduction in marketing expenses 
stock compensation 
we account for stock options in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the stock option is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we disclose pro forma information regarding what net loss would have been if we had accounted for option grants using the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a black scholes merton option pricing model 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  and supersedes apb sfas r requires that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r also requires that tax benefits associated with these stock based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
we adopted sfas r effective january  it will be effective for all awards granted after that date 
for those stock option awards granted prior to january  but for which the vesting period is not complete  we will use the modified prospective transition method permitted by sfas r 
under this method  we will account for such awards on a prospective basis  with expense being recognized in our statement of operations beginning in the first quarter of using the grant date fair values previously calculated for our sfas pro forma disclosures included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will recognize the related compensation cost not previously recognized in the sfas pro forma disclosures over the remaining vesting period 
we anticipate that the impact on our statement of operations of adopting sfas r for our stock options outstanding at december  will be similar to the pro forma impact of sfas included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the incremental expense related to future stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants is difficult to predict because the expense will depend on the number of awards granted  the grant date stock price  volatility of our stock price and other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  aircraft fuel prices and to a far lesser degree interest rate risk 
we have market sensitive instruments in the forms of financial derivative instruments used to hedge hawaiian s exposure to increases in jet fuel prices and a variable interest rate senior credit facility the outstanding principal balance of which was million at december  
we have market risk for the changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from movements in interest rates 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we might undertake to mitigate its exposure to such adverse changes 
actual results may differ 
see the discussion of critical accounting policies above for other information related to these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel costs aircraft fuel costs constitute a significant portion of hawaiian s operating expenses 
fuel costs  inclusive of applicable gains and losses from hawaiian s fuel hedging program  represented approximately and  respectively  of hawaiian s total operating expenses for the years ended december  and based on gallons expected to be consumed in  for every one cent increase in the cost per gallon of jet fuel  hawaiian s annual fuel expense increases by approximately million 
we purchase aircraft fuel at prevailing market prices to manage the associated market risk through the execution of a hedging strategy 
from time to time  we enter into forward contracts to hedge the financial exposure to fluctuations in the cost of such fuel 
during  hawaiian reinstated its fuel hedging program through the use of heating oil forward contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex for approximately of the fuel consumption needs for the subsequent month period 
heating oil  commonly referred to as kerosene  is a distillate of crude oil 
jet fuel represents a specific grade of heating oil and while jet fuel is heating oil  the opposite is not quite true 
as such  the historical correlation between the price of heating oil and jet fuel has been very high  making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of aircraft fuel 
hawaiian s nymex heating oil contracts were liquidated in may  and hawaiian received cash proceeds of million 
since may  hawaiian has entered into jet fuel forward contracts with a single counterparty 
approximately of its fuel consumption requirements for the succeeding twelve months were hedged 
jet fuel forward contracts are not traded on commodities exchanges due to the limited market for such instruments  however  they tend to have a higher level of effectiveness than do heating oil forward contracts 
the fair value of jet fuel forward contracts as of december  related to hawaiian s fuel hedging program was million  which hedged approximately of its anticipated aircraft fuel needs for as of march  hawaiian hedged approximately  and of its second  third and fourth quarter anticipated aircraft fuel needs  respectively 
we measure the fair value of the derivative instruments based on quoted values provided by an affiliate of the counterparty 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  the company does not expect the sole counterparty to fail to meet its obligations 
the credit exposure related to these jet fuel forward contracts is million represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at december  interest rates the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg  interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on certain cash deposits and short term investments 
the company s debt agreements were entered into on june  and june  and include the issuance of the senior credit facility  term b credit facility and series a and series b subordinated convertible notes  the terms of which are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
at december   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt including capital lease obligations of million  and million of variable rate debt indexed to the wells fargo bank prime rate and a libor rate that were and  respectively  on such date 
we do not mitigate the exposure on variable rate debt by entering into interest rate swaps 
a change in market interest rates would  therefore  have corresponding positive or negative effects on our earnings and cash flows associated with our floating rate debt and interest bearing investments because of the variability of these floating interest rate instruments 
for example  a hypothetical percent increase in the wells fargo prime rate and the libor rate would have decreased our pretax earnings and cash flows associated with these items by million annually based on the balances of such variable rate debt as of december  market risk for fixed rate long term debt and capitalized lease obligations is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates  and amounted to approximately million as of december  we are also subject to various financial covenants included in the senior credit facility  term b credit facility  our mastercard visa credit card transaction processing agreement and an agreement with an entity that processes the sales of our tickets by travel agencies 
covenants under these agreements include maintenance of sufficient liquidity and cash reserves  minimum net income  minimum ebitda generally  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for extraordinary non cash charges and credits and leverage ratios 
if conditions adversely change  and we fail to comply with certain of the covenants set forth in the above agreements  it could reduce the amount of credit and or cash available under the agreements  increase our costs to keep these agreements intact and or amend or replace them and  in a worse case scenario  trigger accelerated repayments of the senior credit facility and term b credit facility and cross defaults of other credit agreements such as our aircraft leases
