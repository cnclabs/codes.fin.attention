item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio  television and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
in the quarter ended august   we classified our television assets as held for sale see note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
the results of operations of our television division have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our television division s revenues classified as discontinued operations typically fluctuate from year to year due to political spending  which is the highest in our odd numbered fiscal years 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions  and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties domestic radio revenue growth has been anemic for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of four factors lack of inventory and pricing discipline by radio operators  a more focused newspaper advertising sales force that has slowed the market share gains radio was making vis vis newspapers  the emergence of new media  such as internet advertising and cable interconnects  which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  and the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and mp players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising 
the radio industry has begun several initiatives to address these issues 
first  the radio industry has begun the rollout of high definition hd radio 
music transmitted in hd sounds noticeably better than the current analogue broadcasts 
further  compression technology will enable radio operators to offer second and possibly third or fourth channels within each operator s existing allotted bandwidth 
this will essentially increase the number of radio stations available to listeners in each radio market and enable radio operators to offer a broader selection of free music choices 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters  representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets  have agreed to work together to coordinate the programming on secondary channels in each radio market to ensure a more diverse consumer offering and to accelerate the rollout of hd receivers  particularly in automobiles 
second  the radio industry is reminding listeners of the relevance of radio through its radio you hear it here first promotional campaign 
artists  such as madonna and the rolling stones  have recorded promotional advertisements that highlight the strengths of free  local radio and these advertisements are being aired on radio stations around the us these industry efforts are in addition to the independent decisions of many radio operators to dramatically reduce the number of commercials aired per hour  which serves the dual purpose of creating a more enjoyable experience for listeners plus creating a more favorable pricing environment due to a reduction in the supply of commercials 
our two radio stations in los angeles have suffered significant ratings declines  which has led to a decline in revenues of the stations 
this is primarily due to increased competition in the format of one of the stations 
we intend to invest resources in promoting the stations to strengthen the stations ratings and recapture lost revenues 
emmis is in the process of divesting of all of its television stations 
the decision to sell its television stations stemmed from the company s desire to lower its debt  coupled with the company s view that its television stations needed to be aligned with a company that was larger and more singularly focused on the challenges of american television  including digital video recorders and the industry s relationship with cable and satellite providers 
as of february  emmis has closed on thirteen of its sixteen television stations  receiving gross proceeds of approximately million 
on may   emmis entered into an agreement to sell one of the remaining television stations  wkcf tv 
emmis expects to sell its remaining television stations in the next three to twelve months 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under sfas no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we typically engage an independent appraisal firm to value assets acquired in a material acquisition 
we use the appraisal report to help us allocate the purchase price of the acquisition among different categories of assets 
to the extent that purchased assets are not allocated appropriately  depreciation and amortization expense could be materially different 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
these estimates are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize experts in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of our tax expense and related liabilities 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of febraury  and  respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation claims  automotive liability losses and media liability 
valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company relies heavily upon historical data for its stock price when determining expected volatility  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 

table of contents acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired one television station  a network of international radio stations in belgium  a controlling interest in six domestic radio stations  a national radio network in slovakia and a controlling interest in a national radio network in bulgaria for an aggregate cash purchase price of million

emmis used the cash to repay amounts outstanding under its senior credit facility 
emmis has long sought a second radio station in chicago to complement its existing station in the market  wkqx fm

table of contents our television station in new orleans  louisiana  wvue  was significantly affected by hurricane katrina and the subsequent flooding 
the flooding of new orleans caused extensive property damage at wvue 
although the extent of the property damage is estimated to be approximately million  emmis believes that it is insured subject to applicable deductibles for substantially all property losses resulting from katrina and subsequent flooding as it maintained federal flood insurance and private flood insurance 
since emmis believes recovery of insurance proceeds under its relevant policies is probable  no adjustments to the carrying values of wvue property were made as of february  additionally  the company recorded a million reserve against wvue accounts receivable due to the impact of the flooding on the local economy 
the charge is reflected in the year ended february  in the preceding table 
wvue did not broadcast its signal for an extended period of time as a result of katrina and the general disruption of the local economy will negatively affect ongoing advertising revenue 
the company maintains business interruption insurance and expects to be reimbursed for lost net income as a result of katrina 
however  unlike property and casualty  emmis has not accrued for business interruption insurance proceeds 
business interruption insurance proceeds will only be recognized upon receipt 
the company estimates that the negative revenue impact of the hurricane was approximately million for the year ended february  net income loss for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net income loss    not applicable the increase in net income for the year ended february  is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of television properties discussed above and the prior year s adoption of eitf topic d  which resulted in a million charge  and loss on debt extinguishment discussed above  net of tax benefits 
approximately million of the loss on debt extinguishment was not deducted for purposes of calculating the provision benefit for income taxes

we believe we were able to outperform the markets in which we operate due to our commitment to training and developing local sales forces  as well as higher ratings  resulting  in part  from increased promotional spending in prior quarters

our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  funding acquisitions and preferred stock dividend requirements 
we also have used  and may continue to use  capital to repurchase our common stock

after the closing of the sale of the four stations to sjl  emmis made a special payment to television employees of approximately million and to corporate employees other than executive officers of approximately million 
these costs were expensed in the company s quarter ended february   commensurate with the closing of these four stations to sjl  as the special payment was conditioned on the closing or commencement of an lma on thirteen of the original sixteen television stations and the closing of the sale of the four stations to sjl satisfied that requirement 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the television asset sales 
emmis used the aggregate net proceeds to repay million of debt under its credit facility  of which million was permanent reductions in amounts outstanding under the term loan 
since repayments under the term loan permanently reduce borrowing availability  we wrote off approximately million of unamortized deferred debt costs as a loss on debt extinguishment in the quarter ended february  in january  emmis also used million of the television sale proceeds to redeem a pro rata portion of its floating rate senior notes at par 
in connection with the redemption  emmis wrote off approximately million of unamortized deferred debt costs as a loss on debt extinguishment in the quarter ended february  as indicated above  million of cash on hand at february  was used to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of the floating rate senior notes on march  notice of the redemption was given on february  emmis will write off the remaining unamortized deferred debt issue costs of million during the quarter ended may  the remaining net cash proceeds were used to fund other costs associated with the television sale including severance and general corporate purposes

emmis hopes to close this transaction by the end of its quarter ended august  and plans to use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt obligations  to fund acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes 
in accordance with the asset sale provisions of its senior subordinated notes  by late  emmis must either make a par offer to redeem million of the notes  repay million of additional debt under its credit facility or make a million permitted investment in a related business  as defined in the agreement 
emmis is evaluating its options under this requirement  including a combination of the above  as well as the financing of the resulting transaction 
on september   emmis signed a definitive agreement to sell radio station wrda fm in st 
louis  mo to radio one  inc for million 
radio one  inc began operating this station pursuant to a lma effective october  radio one  inc made no monthly payments to emmis  but reimbursed emmis for substantially all of emmis costs to operate the station 
closing of this sale occurred may  and emmis used the proceeds to repay outstanding debt obligations

the notes were redeemed on january  and march  at par 
interest on the notes accrued at a floating rate per annum  reset quarterly  equal to libor plus approximately at february  
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february   as compared to the same period in the prior year  is due to the loss of approximately million in net political revenues in the current year as compared to the prior year  coupled with higher interest costs and bonus and severance amounts incurred in connection with the sale of thirteen of the company s sixteen television stations 
cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million in the same period of the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to cash received from the sale of thirteen of the company s sixteen television stations  as discussed in sources of liquidity above 
investing activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have consummated numerous acquisitions and divestitures in the three years ended february  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as corollary businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
conversely  as evidenced by our plans to sell our television stations  kkfr fm in phoenix  and wrda fm in st 
louis  we continually evaluate our portfolio and we will monetize assets when others see greater value in selected assets than we do 
in the years ended february   and  we had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to high definition hd radio technology 
we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and equipment upgrades in connection with our rollout of hd radio 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
emmis has entered into an agreement with ibiquity digital corporation to employ high definition hd radio technology at nineteen of our radio stations by june  under the agreement  the company incurred approximately million and million to implement hd radio at eleven of its stations during the years ended february  and  respectively 
the company expects to incur approximately million beyond fiscal to convert the remaining eight stations 
amounts related to our digital radio build out are included in contractual cash obligations under the heading purchase obligations 
our television station in new orleans  louisiana  wvue  was significantly affected by hurricane katrina and the subsequent flooding 
the flooding of new orleans caused extensive property damage at wvue 
although the extent of the property damage is estimated to be approximately million  emmis believes that it is insured subject to applicable deductibles for substantially all property losses resulting from katrina and subsequent flooding as it maintained federal flood insurance and private flood insurance 
through april   the company has received million in federal flood insurance proceeds and million in private flood insurance proceeds 

table of contents financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to debt repayment of million with cash received from the sale of thirteen of the company s sixteen television stations  as discussed in sources of liquidity above 
also discussed in sources of liquidity above  emmis purchased  shares of its class a common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in addition  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to be made effective after the completion of the tender offer 
the share repurchase program would permit emmis to purchase class a shares equal to of the total outstanding shares after the tender offer 
whether or to what extent emmis chooses to make such purchases will depend upon market conditions and emmis capital needs  and there is no assurance that emmis will conclude such purchases for any or all of the authorized amounts remaining 
on june   emmis issued million of its floating rate senior notes in exchange for i the million aggregate principal amount of interim notes issued on june   and ii million in cash 
the interim notes were retired on june  emmis used approximately million of the cash proceeds from the notes transactions to repay borrowings it had incurred under its revolving credit facility on june   approximately million of cash proceeds from the notes transactions to pay debt issuance fees and approximately million for interest and other

the transaction resulted in an additional loss on debt extinguishment of million  which emmis recorded in its quarter ended august  the new senior credit facility provided for total borrowings of up to billion  including i a million term loan and ii a million revolver  of which million may be used for letters of credit 
as discussed in sources of liquidity above  the term loan has been permanently reduced by repayments from television asset sale proceeds  as well as  one half of the proceeds received from the radio station swap with bonneville in january and quarterly amortization 
the senior credit facility also provides for the ability to have incremental facilities of up to million  of which up to million may be allocated to a revolver 
emmis may access the incremental facility on one or more occasions  subject to certain provisions  including a potential market adjustment to pricing of the entire credit facility 
all outstanding amounts under the new credit facility bear interest  at the option of emmis  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate as defined in the new credit facility plus a margin 
the margin over the eurodollar rate or the alternative base rate varies under the revolver ranging from to  depending on emmis ratio of debt to consolidated operating cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
the margins over the eurodollar rate or the alternative base rate are and  respectively  for the term loan facility 
interest is due on a calendar quarter basis under the alternative base rate and at least every three months under the eurodollar rate 
both the term loan and revolver mature on november  the borrowings due under the term loan are payable in equal quarterly installments in an annual amount equal to of the term loan during each of the first six and one quarter years of the loan beginning on february   with the remaining balance payable november  on august   emmis exchanged the million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes for a new series of notes registered under the securities act

all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility was approximately  and our overall weighted average borrowing rate  after taking into account amounts outstanding under our senior subordinated notes  senior floating rate notes and senior discount notes  was approximately

this amount is comprised of million for interest under our senior subordinated notes  million for repayment of term notes under our credit facility and million in preferred stock dividend requirements 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october at april   we had million available under our credit facility  net of million in outstanding letters of credit and exclusive of term b loan mandatory repayments of up to million see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to continue to use its significant cash flows from operations to primarily repay outstanding debt obligations 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as corollary businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our minority partner s entire interest in six radio stations in austin  texas after a period of approximately five years from the acquisition date based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 

table of contents intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options  using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
statement no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under statement no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
the company elected to follow the modified prospective method upon adoption of this pronouncement on march  consequently  the company began recognizing compensation cost as expense during its fiscal quarter ending may  for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using black scholes option pricing model  which is the same option pricing model used to estimate grant date fair value for sfas for pro forma disclosures included in the table below 
although the company did not have any significant unvested stock option awards outstanding as of february   it granted stock options to its employees on march  see note 
the company s net income will be reduced by this grant and future grants of equity awards based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
on september   the eitf issued topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill 
for all of the company s acquisitions completed prior to its adoption of sfas no 
on june   the company allocated a portion of the purchase price to the acquisition s tangible assets in accordance with a third party appraisal  with the remainder of the purchase price being allocated to the fcc license 
this allocation method is commonly called the residual method and results in all of the acquisition s intangible assets  including goodwill  being included in the company s fcc license value 
although the company has directly valued the fcc license of stations acquired since its adoption of sfas no 
 the company had retained the use of the residual method to perform its annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
for acquisitions effected prior to the adoption of sfas no 
eitf topic d prohibits the use of the residual method and precludes companies from reclassifying to goodwill any goodwill that was originally included in the value of the fcc license  resulting in a write off 
implementation of eitf topic d was required no later than emmis fiscal year ended february   but the company elected to adopt it as of december  and recorded a noncash charge of million  net of tax  in its fourth quarter of fiscal as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
this loss has no impact on the company s cash flows or compliance with its debt covenants 
since its adoption of sfas no 
on march   the company no longer amortizes goodwill for financial statement purposes 
accordingly  reported and pro forma results reflecting the impact of this accounting pronouncement are the same for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all of our segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 

table of contents inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly since our senior bank debt is entirely floating rate debt

while emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period forint to dollar  euro to dollar  koruna to dollar  or leva to dollar exchange rates for calendar  we believe any devaluation of the forint  euro  koruna or leva would have an immaterial effect on our financial statements taken as a whole  as the hungarian  belgian  slovakian and bulgarian stations accounted for approximately of emmis total revenues and approximately of emmis total assets as of  and for the year ended  february  at february  the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding 
the hungarian subsidiary repaid million of us dollar denominated loans during fiscal in the company s fiscal quarter ended february   it was determined that certain loans to its owned hungarian subsidiary were no longer deemed to be permanently invested 
as of february   these loans total million 
the company began recording foreign currency gains and losses related to these loans in its fiscal quarter ended february  and will continue to record foreign currency gains and losses until the loans are fully repaid 
the belgium  bulgarian and slovakian stations had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during fiscal or at february  emmis currently does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
