this section is organized as follows our business an overview of our business  a discussion of current business and industry opportunities  challenges  and risks  and a discussion of significant developments affecting our business  litigation  and regulatory matters 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
results of operations an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december    and  as reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
liquidity  financial position  and capital resources a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended december  and  a discussion of selected changes in our financial position  and a summary of our future contractual obligations 
our business overview we are a dynamic educational services company committed to quality  career focused learning and led by passionate professionals who inspire individual worth and lifelong achievement 
since our founding in  we have progressed rapidly toward our goal of becoming the world s leading provider of quality educational services 
we are the world s largest on ground provider of private  for profit postsecondary education and have a substantial and growing presence in online education 
our schools  which are segregated into two reporting segments  prepare students for professionally and personally rewarding careers through the operation of campuses  including two online campuses  located throughout the united states and in france  canada  and the united kingdom 
the csu segment represents an aggregation of our on ground schools that provide educational services primarily in a classroom or laboratory setting 
our csu segment schools offer doctoral degree  master s degree  bachelor s degree  associate degree  and non degree certificate and diploma programs in the career oriented disciplines of business studies  visual communication and design technologies  health education  culinary arts  and information technology 
the operating results of our csu segment schools fluctuate on a quarterly basis  primarily as a result of changes in student enrollment 
our csu segment schools typically experience a seasonal increase in enrollment in the fall  traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begins postsecondary education 
furthermore  although we encourage year round attendance at all campuses  certain programs offered by some of our csu segment schools include summer breaks 
as a result of these factors  total student enrollment and revenue for our csu segment schools are typically highest in the fourth quarter october through december and lowest in the second quarter april through june 
operating costs for our csu segment schools do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis  except for admissions and advertising expenses  which are typically higher during the second quarter and third quarter april through september in support of seasonally high enrollment 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will continue 
the oeg segment represents an aggregation of the online campuses of aiu  aiu online  and ctu  ctu online and stonecliffe college online an academic division of ctu 
our schools online campuses collectively offer degree programs in the career oriented disciplines of information technology  computer science  business  visual communication  criminal justice  and education 
these programs provide students with the knowledge and skills that we believe they will need to compete successfully in today s competitive job market 
the results of operations of aiu online fluctuate on a quarterly basis  primarily as a result of the campuses academic calendar and  more specifically  the number of instructional days in each quarter 
historically  the number of revenue generating instructional days has been highest during the first and second quarters january through june  lower in the third quarter july through september  and lowest in the fourth quarter october through december 
the operating costs of aiu online do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will continue 
the results of operations of ctu online are not significantly impacted by seasonal trends  as  historically  the number of revenue generating instructional days during each quarter and related operating costs have not fluctuated significantly 
during  we continued our strong growth trends and opened new doors for students through innovations in online education 
we also faced a number of significant challenges during the year related to  among other things  certain legal and regulatory matters  negative publicity resulting from such matters  and heightened scrutiny of the for profit  postsecondary education industry 
as a result of these and other operational issues  the student population and operating margin percentage of our csu segment declined during online student population continued to grow during  which we believe demonstrates the growing societal acceptance of online education programs and the increasing demand for our schools online offerings 
our total student population as of january   was approximately  students  including approximately  students enrolled at our oeg segment campuses 
we expect that will be a year of opportunity and positive change 
we will continue to concentrate on sustainable growth initiatives that we believe will support long term growth 
chief among them is our commitment to providing high quality education supported by excellent customer service and a well developed infrastructure 
in furtherance of this commitment  we will continue to focus on the complete student academic life cycle  which begins with admissions and ends with graduation and employment 
to better meet the needs and demands of our students during  we will expand the scope and availability of our newly developed hybrid learning model 
we will also centralize certain of our telemarketing efforts at our corporate office to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these efforts and improve lead conversion rates 
we believe that  by the end of  csu segment population  which declined during  will trend upward  in part  as a result of these efforts 
we expect enrollment at our schools online campuses to continue to grow at a high rate 
we will continue to promote a strong compliance culture throughout our organization and are dedicated to working cooperatively with applicable federal and state agencies and accrediting bodies to resolve existing regulatory matters 
current business and industry opportunities  challenges and risks in addition to the risk factors discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  we have identified a number of key factors and trends related to our business and industry that represent opportunities  challenges  and risks 
us department of education 
as previously disclosed  the ed notified us in june that it is reviewing our previously announced restated consolidated financial statements and our annual compliance audit opinions for the years through at the same time  the ed also advised us that it is evaluating pending school program reviews that have taken place at certain of our schools  which are all included in our csu segment 
the ed has indicated that until these matters are addressed to its satisfaction  it will not approve any new applications by us for pre acquisition review or change of ownership 
the ed has further advised us that during this period  it will not approve applications for any additional branch campuses  which the ed refers to generally in its regulations as additional locations 
in february  we received a letter from the ed notifying us that it is reviewing our compliance audit opinions and that the general restrictions imposed pursuant to its letter to us in june will remain in place as it continues its review 
see note commitments and contingencies federal regulatory actions of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for additional discussion of this matter 
we cannot predict the duration or outcome of the ed s review  and the review may expand  and other regulatory agencies may become involved 
furthermore  any adverse publicity related to this action may harm our reputation and impair our ability to attract and retain students at our schools 
these restrictions imposed by the ed  or a negative outcome of the ed s review  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
american intercontinental university accreditation matter 
as previously disclosed  on december   sacs notified aiu that sacs had placed the school on probation status for one year pending the school s satisfactory remediation of certain accreditation matters with regards to sacs principles of accreditation 
a status review of aiu s probation status is currently scheduled for sacs december meeting 
aiu is in the process of addressing sacs recommendations and is committed to resolving all issues identified 
see note commitments and contingencies accrediting body actions of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of this matter 
on ground operations 
as noted previously  student population at many of our on ground schools declined during while cost cutting measures were enacted in an effort to mitigate the effect on profitability of such declines in student population  lower than expected student population at our on ground schools had an adverse impact on operating margin percentages  and we believe that the operating margin percentages of our on ground schools will continue to be depressed until student enrollment begins to increase 
on ground school retention rates have been trending upward in recent months  and we believe opportunities exist for significant further improvement 
lead generation remains strong  and lead costs remain stable 
we believe these factors will have a stabilizing effect in the near term on on ground student population and ultimately contribute to future on ground student population growth 
during  we will continue to refine the advertising strategy of our on ground schools to ensure that a majority of our advertising dollars are spent on media sources that demonstrate the greatest promise of attracting quality leads 
we will also hire additional admissions staff  as necessary  to ensure that the leads generated pursuant to our marketing efforts are effectively pursued on a timely basis 
as previously disclosed  the adoption of stricter credit standards has resulted in a reduction of bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue at our on ground schools but has also limited the number of prospective students who qualify for certain private financing options 
while our adoption of stricter credit standards has adversely affected population growth at certain of our on ground schools  we believe that our adherence to such standards is in the best long term interest of our schools 
we will continue to evaluate the private financing options that we offer to our students to ensure that such offerings are aligned with our objectives of consistent  quality enrollment and profitability growth 
the variable spending of our on ground schools is based primarily on projected student population levels  and we continuously evaluate the variable cost structure of our on ground campuses to ensure that it is consistent with existing and expected student enrollment 
certain costs  including depreciation and occupancy costs  are relatively fixed in the short term and may not always be adjustable in response to variations in student population levels 
however  to the extent that certain on ground schools have space capacity in excess of that we believe is necessary to support expected future enrollment growth  we may pursue opportunities to reduce short term and long term occupancy costs by subleasing such excess space or terminating existing lease agreements 
during the last three months of and throughout  the schools that comprise our gibbs operating division  which is aggregated into our csu segment  experienced a significant decline in student population relative to student population in prior periods 
this decline in student population has resulted in a decrease in revenue for the gibbs operating division relative to prior periods and has negatively impacted the profitability of our csu segment as a whole 
we continue to expect limited growth and low levels of profitability from the gibbs operating division in the near term 
our management is devoting increased attention to the gibbs operating division schools in an effort to improve the division s performance 
we have identified a number of factors in recent months that suggest the stabilization of  but not necessarily an improvement in  gibbs operating results  including  among others  improvements in show rates and retention rates  a reduction in employee turnover  and a reduction in bad debt expense 
also  we believe that the introduction by our gibbs schools of certain high demand programs will have a positive impact on enrollment and profitability during our culinary startup campuses  including our lcb campuses in las vegas  miami  and atlanta  and our kitchen academy campus in hollywood  california have progressed as planned and are expected to contribute positively to future student enrollment and profitability growth 
while we currently have no plans to sell or close any of our on ground schools  we continuously evaluate our schools programs to ensure that there is a market for the programs that the school offers and that our continued investment in the school is consistent with our overall objective of maximizing stockholder value 
online operations 
we expect that the operating margin percentage achieved by our oeg segment campuses will continue to be strong but may decline from prior period levels as a result of a ctu online growth rate that is expected to exceed the aiu online growth rate  and  to a lesser degree  our investment in ctu s second online platform  stonecliffe college online  which began instruction in february ctu online operates at a lower operating margin percentage than does aiu online  and  thus  the disproportionate anticipated growth of our ctu online campus is expected to effectively lower the operating margin percentage of the oeg segment as a whole 
as a result of the expected disproportionate growth of ctu online and the introduction of stonecliffe college online  both of which offer longer termed programs than does aiu online  we expect average revenue per online student to decrease in the future 
however  we believe that by providing our customers with a flexible array of online programs  including the accelerated programs offered by aiu online  the traditionally paced programs offered by ctu online  and the decelerated programs offered by ctu online and stonecliffe college online  we have increased and will continue to increase our market share 
aiu online enrollment growth rates declined during and are likely to continue to slow in the future as the business matures 
we also believe that aiu online s new student enrollment has been adversely impacted by negative publicity related to aiu s probation status 
however  we believe there remains a high level of interest in aiu online s accelerated programs and that such demand will enable aiu online to sustain strong growth rates in the long term 
the results of operations and operating margin percentage of our oeg segment during were adversely impacted by an increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in oeg segment bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in overall oeg segment student retention  which was attributable largely to the disproportionate growth of ctu online 
ctu online  as discussed above  offers longer programs and has historically experienced a higher rate of student attrition than has aiu online 
thus  the disproportionate growth of ctu online resulted in a reduction of the overall retention rate of the oeg segment and an overall increase in oeg bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
negative press coverage 
we believe that negative press coverage in and regarding us and certain of our schools may be adversely impacting the rate at which our leads for prospective students are converting into enrolled students and the rate at which our enrolled students are starting school  particularly at the schools that have been the subject of local negative publicity 
however  the negative press coverage does not appear to have adversely affected our lead volume or lead cost in most of the markets that we serve 
evaluation of goodwill balances 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill balances were reviewed for impairment during through the application of a fair value based test 
the results of the test indicated no goodwill impairment  as  for all reporting units  our estimate of reporting unit fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
our estimate of the fair value of each of our reporting units was based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows and other assumptions 
although we believe our projections and resulting fair values are reasonable  historically  our projections have not always been achieved 
for our health education division and gibbs division reporting units  estimated fair values exceed carrying values by a relatively slim margin  such that the failure of either of these reporting units to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce its estimated fair value below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge  the amount of which we are not able to determine at this time 
the goodwill balance as of december   attributable to our health education division and gibbs division is million and million  respectively 
we will continue to monitor the operating results and cash flows of these reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
student accounts receivable key indicators 
given the reduction in days sales outstanding and student receivable balances that we have realized in  relative to days sales outstanding and student receivable balances  as discussed herein  opportunities to further reduce bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis may be limited 
furthermore  increases in days sales outstanding and student receivable balances or changes in the relative distribution of our total student receivable balances between in school student receivables and out of school student receivables may result in an increase in our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
hybrid learning 
during  we made advances in the development of our unique hybrid learning model  which capitalizes on our schools online campuses virtual campus platform and enables students at our on ground campuses to complete approximately of their academic program on ground and approximately online 
aiu and ctu were our first on ground schools to offer hybrid educational programs as a complement to those schools existing online campuses 
we expect to expand our hybrid learning offerings to other selected schools during international expansion 
we believe that the international market for our services represents a significant growth opportunity 
we believe that international students are increasingly turning to online us educational programs as a means of obtaining a us education without incurring the high travel and living costs and facing stringent visa requirements associated with studying abroad 
our belief is supported by the fact that the student population of our schools online campuses includes students located in more than countries 
in addition  many us residents live and work in foreign countries and could benefit from the opportunity to continue their education while outside the us we have also continued to pursue opportunities to expand our on ground presence internationally  both through the growth of our existing schools  such as our inseec group  and through potential acquisitions of foreign educational institutions 
the restrictions imposed by the ed do not affect our international expansion pospects 
new initiatives 
in october  we announced the launch of our new initiatives group  whose mission is to expand the scope of our online business 
the new initiatives group has initially focused on the development of a range of short term online learning and informational programs that will generate revenue through the sale of products  premium content  and advertising space 
the educational and informational focus of these online programs is aimed at the growing number of internet consumers who are enthusiasts of topics related to our core curricula  including culinary arts  health education  and information technology 
our new online development initiatives are designed to expand our reach into the broad consumer market with online offerings that target growing segments of internet users 
in october  our new initiatives group launched chefs 
com  its first consumer focused website 
chefs 
com is a culinary super site that provides consumers with interactive features  multi media content  a courseware library  and a diverse recipe collection 
in february  our new initiative group launched blish 
com  a fully digital marketplace aimed at bringing together buyers and sellers of digital content 
utilizing blish 
com s easy to use web portal  owners of digital content may post their content for sale in real time  control the price of each item  and collect royalties from sales 
blish 
com markets a wide array of digital content  including text files  such as e books  manuals  and legal forms  computer related items  such as software  video games  d modeling  and stock photography  audio files  including motivational seminars  academic lectures  and music tracks  and other consumer items such as ring tones  screen savers  mobile games  and video clips 
the new initiatives group will continue to develop additional enthusiast websites related to our core curricula 
economic conditions 
we believe that an overall strengthening of the macroeconomic conditions in the us has provided potential students with more viable immediate employment opportunities and may be adversely impacting our ability to successfully recruit and enroll students 
as a result of a stronger job market  we believe that prospective students may choose to enter or remain in the workforce rather than pursue continuing education 
this trend has affected the operating results at some of our schools  as we believe there is a level of counter cyclicality inherent within certain of our program offerings  as evidenced by the recent decreased lead conversion rates and show rates for those programs 
litigation and regulatory matters see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of selected litigation and regulatory matters 
summary of significant accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k  which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories  tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students of educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for tuition at the beginning of an academic term  and we recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight line basis over the academic term  which includes any applicable externship periods 
the portion of tuition payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school and on the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance tuition costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
our schools generally increase tuition one or more times annually 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  contract training revenue  and cafeteria revenue 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria services is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  restaurant revenue  and contract training revenue  is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit in accordance with eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit for tuition to a portion of the students who are in enrolled at our schools 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
our schools calculate and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on a standard allowance estimation methodology developed by corporate financial management 
as discussed in note change in allowance for doubtful accounts estimate of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k  effective december   we modified our allowance estimation methodology in the fourth quarter of our standard allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on our credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source for example  federal loan or grant  state grant  private loan  student cash payments  etc  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
our allowance estimation methodology divides our accounts receivable due from in school students into groups according to each student s primary funding source 
our allowance methodology for out of school student accounts separates such accounts into two categories of students those who have completed their programs of study and those that have not 
we apply allowance percentage estimates that are based upon our historical collections experience to each in school student funding source group and out of school student category 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
in this way  we believe that our allowance estimation methodology reflects our most recent collections experience and is responsive to changes in the total mix of student funding sources 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
our standard allowance estimation methodology is evaluated for propriety by corporate financial management on a periodic basis and modified as necessary 
changes to the design of our standard allowance estimation methodology  including our allowance percentage estimates  may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
corporate financial management reviews the allowance estimate calculations completed by each of our campuses to monitor compliance with our allowance estimation methodology and  based on judgment and consideration of emerging trends and existing facts and circumstances  may adjust the consolidated balance of our allowance estimate  as appropriate 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables as of december   would result in a change in net income of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
contingencies we accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to  settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
to date  no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods

also included in educational services and facilities expense are costs of other goods and services provided by our schools  including  among other things  costs of textbooks  laptop computers  dormitory services  restaurant services  contract training  and cafeteria services 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in corporate and school administration  marketing  admissions  accounting  human resources  legal  and compliance 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  occupancy of the corporate offices  and bad debt expense are also included in this expense category 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue colleges  schools and universities segment revenue 
csu segment tuition and registration fee revenue increased million  or  from billion during to billion during the csu segment tuition and registration fee revenue increase is primarily attributable to price increases at most of our csu segment schools during  which averaged approximately but varies depending on school  geographic area  and program 
the increase is also attributable to a shift in student enrollment mix 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decline in average student population during at a majority of our csu segment schools as compared to the average student population of our csu segment schools during csu segment other revenue decreased million  or  from million during to million during this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in laptop computer sales at many of our csu segment schools  which is largely a result of the overall decline in average student population during at those schools 
a decrease during in contract training revenue  resulting primarily from the discontinuation of contract training programs at certain of our csu segment schools  also contributed to the overall decrease in csu segment other revenue 
online education group segment revenue 
oeg segment tuition and registration fee revenue increased million  or  from million during to million during oeg segment tuition and registration fee revenue growth is primarily attributable to an increase in average student population at our schools online campuses during as compared to average student population at our schools online campuses during our schools online campus student population growth is primarily attributable to the continued growth of the online education market and our schools online campuses continued penetration into that expanded market through increased investment in marketing activities and recruiting efforts and an expansion of program offerings and online platforms 
during the first quarter of  our schools online campuses began billing new students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies  which is included as a component of tuition and registration fee revenue 
previously  these required program materials were billed separately from tuition  and the related revenue was recorded as a component of other revenue 
the impact of this change has resulted in the disproportionate growth of oeg segment tuition and registration fee revenue relative to the decline of oeg segment other revenue 
oeg segment other revenue decreased million  or  from million during to million during this decrease in oeg segment other revenue is primarily attributable to the change in tuition and program material billing discussed above 
educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased million  or  from million during to million during the increase in educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to an overall increase in academic and occupancy costs at both our csu segment schools and our oeg segment online campuses 
the increase in csu segment educational services and facilities expense represents approximately seven percentage points of the total increase in educational services and facilities expense 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased academic salaries and benefits costs resulting from increases in employee headcount at our csu schools 
also contributing to the increase in csu segment educational services and facilities expense are increased occupancy costs attributable to our existing csu schools expansion activities and new start up campuses opened primarily in and  to a lesser extent  in increases in csu segment educational services and facilities expense were offset  in part  by the effect of spending restraints and cost reduction measures enacted during by many of our csu segment schools in response to the decline in average student population at those schools 
we believe that these cost reduction measures did not affect the quality of student services 
the increase in oeg segment educational services and facilities expense represents approximately six percentage points of the total increase in educational services and facilities expense 
this increase was primarily driven by increases in salaries and benefits of academic staff hired by our schools online campuses during the year to support the growth of the business 
the increase in educational services and facilities expense is also attributable to additional student service activities designed to improve retention  an increase in curriculum development activities  and an increase in occupancy costs associated with facility expansions in support of our schools online campuses during and the increase in oeg segment educational services and facilities expense is also attributable to investments made during by ctu in stonecliffe college online 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million during to million during this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising  marketing  and admissions costs at both our csu segment schools and our oeg segment online campuses  an increase in bad debt expense at our oeg segment online campuses  and an increase in net  unallocated corporate administrative costs 
the increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in bad debt expense at our csu segment schools 
the increase in oeg segment general and administrative expense represents approximately percentage points of the total increase in general and administrative expense 
as discussed above  the increase in oeg segment general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to an increase in general advertising  marketing  and admissions costs  which were incurred by our schools online campuses in support of increased student lead  enrollment  and start volume 
an increase in admissions headcount resulted in increased salaries and benefits expense in this area 
the increase is also attributable to increased financial aid  career services  and other administrative costs incurred by our schools online campuses necessary to support the increase in online student population mentioned above 
the increase in oeg segment general and administrative expense is also attributable to investments made during by ctu in stonecliffe college online 
contributing significantly to the increase in oeg segment general and administrative expense was an increase in bad debt expense at our schools online campuses of approximately million  or  from million during to million during the increase in oeg segment bad debt expense is primarily attributable to a decline in student retention at our schools online campuses during the year  resulting in a shift in the relative distribution of student receivable balances from in school student receivables to out of school student receivables 
out of school student receivable balances generally pose a greater credit risk than do in school student receivables and are subject to higher bad debt allowance percentages 
the decline in online student retention during was attributable largely to the disproportionate growth of ctu online 
ctu online  as discussed above  offers longer programs and has historically experienced a higher rate of student attrition than has aiu online 
thus  the disproportionate growth of ctu online during resulted in a reduction in the overall retention rate of the oeg segment and an overall increase in oeg segment bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
improving retention rates will continue to be a focus for our schools online campuses in the future 
csu segment general and administrative expense decreased during the decrease in csu segment general and administrative expense represents approximately three percentage points of the total increase in general and administrative expense 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense at our csu segment schools of approximately million  or  from million during to million during the decrease in csu segment bad debt expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall student receivable exposure at our domestic csu segment schools  primarily as a result of strong cash collections and stricter credit practices exercised during the period 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge for a change in accounting estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million  which was primarily related to our csu segment schools 
the recording of this change in estimate during  to a certain extent  has diminished the comparability of and bad debt expense levels 
see note change in allowance for doubtful accounts estimate of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of this matter 
the decrease in csu segment bad debt expense during the year was offset  in part  by an increase in administrative salaries and benefits costs incurred by our csu segment schools  due primarily to employee headcount increases in the areas of compliance and financial aid processing  and increases in admissions and advertising costs incurred in support of enrollment targets 
overall csu segment general administrative  advertising  marketing  and admissions cost increases were less than anticipated due to the effect of spending restraints and cost reduction measures enacted during at many of our csu schools in response to the decline in average student population discussed above 
we believe that these spending restraints and cost reduction measures did not affect the quality of student services 
the increase in corporate and other general and administrative expense represents approximately three percentage points of the total increase in general and administrative expense 
the increase in net unallocated corporate and other general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits costs  caused largely by personnel increases within the corporate compliance  internal audit  and legal departments 
corporate personnel increases associated with certain centralized functions  including accounting  financial aid processing  and cash collections  also contributed to the significant increase in salaries and benefits costs 
the increase in corporate salaries and benefits costs was offset  in part  by a decrease in outside counsel legal fees  primarily attributable to a reduction in costs related to our class action lawsuits  the ongoing sec investigation and the development of our internal legal department 
income from operations and operating margin percentage income from operations increased million  or  from million during to million during our operating margin percentage increased from during to during the increase in income from operations is primarily attributable to the operating margin growth of our oeg segment during  offset  in part  by a slight decrease in operating margin at our csu segment  primarily attributable to the decline in student population discussed above  and an increase in net unallocated corporate and other costs 
the increase in our consolidated operating margin percentage is primarily attributable to the disproportionate growth of our oeg segment  which traditionally has operated at a higher margin level than has our csu segment 
interest income interest income increased million  from million during to million during  primarily as a result of an increase in average invested cash balances 
also contributing to the increase  during the second quarter of  we began investing a portion of our excess cash balances in available for sale investments that generally return investment yields in excess of the yields on cash equivalent securities  in which we have historically invested our excess cash 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  or  from million during to million during this increase is primarily a result of an increase in pretax income from continuing operations during of million  offset  in part  by a reduction of our effective income tax rate from during to during the decrease in our effective tax rate is attributable to the impact of various tax planning strategies  favorable changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate  and an increase in tax exempt interest earned on invested cash balances 
future changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate may further impact our effective income tax rate 
loss from discontinued operations during  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million 
the loss from discontinued operations is attributable to a million loss recognized upon the disposition of the net assets of our iadt montreal campus that was designated for teach out in january the remainder of the loss from discontinued operations is attributable to a million loss related to our iadt ottawa campus  which completed all teach out activities during the first quarter of see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of discontinued operations

also  during the first quarter of  our schools online campuses began billing new students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies  which is included as a component of tuition and registration fee revenue 
previously  these required program materials were billed separately from tuition  and the related revenue was recorded as a component of other revenue 
the impact of this change has resulted in the disproportionate growth of oeg segment tuition and registration fee revenue relative to the growth of oeg segment other revenue  as discussed below

the ed requires that title iv program funds collected in advance of student billings be kept in a separate cash account until students are billed for the portion of their program related to those title iv program funds collected 
these restricted cash balances generally remain in these separate accounts for an average of to days from receipt 
we do not recognize restricted cash balances on our consolidated balance sheets until all restrictions have lapsed with respect to those balances 
as of december  and  the amount of restricted cash balances kept in separate cash accounts was not significant 
restrictions on these cash balances have not affected  nor do we believe that such restrictions will affect  our ability to fund our daily operations 
as previously disclosed  the ed notified us in june that it is reviewing our previously announced restated consolidated financial statements and our annual compliance audit opinions for the years through at the same time  the ed also advised us that it is evaluating pending program reviews that have taken place at certain of our schools  which are all included in our csu segment

the amounts included in the table above represent future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases 
capital lease obligations

the increase in total cash and cash equivalents and investments is primarily attributable to cash flows generated from operations during the year  offset  in part  by cash of million used during to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately per share in connection with our stock repurchase program 
student receivables 
the decrease in net student receivables is primarily attributable to improvements in our financial aid packaging and cash collections processes during the year due  in part  to the centralization of these functions for certain of our schools during our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables and quarterly days sales outstanding dso as of december    and  were as follows as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables quarterly days sales outstanding in days we calculate dso by dividing net receivables  including both student receivables and other receivables  by quarterly average daily revenue 
quarterly average daily revenue is computed by dividing total quarterly revenue by the total number of days in the quarter 
the decreases in both dso and our allowance as a percentage of gross student receivables from december   to december   are primarily attributable to improvements in financial aid packaging and strong cash collections during the year  as previously discussed 
prepaid expenses 
the increase in prepaid expenses is primarily attributable to increases in a prepaid rents related to lease agreements signed during the year  b prepaid software maintenance costs related to corporate information technology upgrades implemented during  and c prepaid insurance premium balances primarily related to insurance rate increases experienced during the year 
other current assets 
the increase in other current assets is primarily attributable to an increase in tenant improvement allowance receivables related to lease agreements entered into during the year 
see the deferred rent obligations discussion below for further information 
accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts payable is primarily attributable to the implementation of an automated voucher approval and payment process at certain of our schools and the corporate office during  which resulted in a significant reduction in our balance of past due invoices 
accrued income taxes 
the increase in accrued income taxes is primarily attributable to the overall increase in pretax income during the year  offset  in part  by federal and state income tax payments made during the year and the reduction in our effective tax rate from during to during accrued other expenses 
the increase in other accrued expenses is primarily attributable to a an increase in accrued advertising and production costs during the year  which is primarily due to increased advertising and marketing spending by our schools online campuses in support of continued growth initiatives and in anticipation of the february opening of stonecliffe college online  and b an increase in accrued insurance premiums for healthcare and certain liability insurance coverage 
deferred tuition revenue 
the decrease in deferred tuition revenue is primarily attributable to a change in the timing of disbursements of recourse and non recourse loan funds at certain of our culinary division schools 
the disbursement of recourse and non recourse loan funds for these schools students is now more closely aligned with the timing of scheduled billings 
the decline in overall csu segment student population from december   to december   also contributed to the decrease in deferred tuition revenue at many of our csu segment schools 
these decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in deferred tuition revenue for our oeg segment campuses due to population increases from december   to december  deferred rent obligations 
on february   the sec issued explanatory guidance expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
subsequently  we initiated a review of our lease related accounting and determined that our previous method of accounting for tenant improvement allowances was not in accordance with gaap 
we had historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions of the related leasehold improvement asset on our consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with gaap  tenant improvement allowances should be recorded as a leasehold improvement asset and deferred rent obligation on our consolidated balance sheets 
during  we recorded leasehold improvements and deferred rent obligations on our consolidated balance sheets in recognition of tenant improvement allowances due or received from lessors 
these accounting changes  had they been adopted in prior periods  would not have had a significant effect on prior period consolidated operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
the increase in our consolidated deferred rent obligations also reflects normal increases in deferred rent obligations associated with lease arrangements with escalating rent payments 
treasury stock 
as discussed above  during we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million at an average price of approximately per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure our borrowings under our credit agreements bear annual interest at variable rates tied to the prime rate and the eurocurrency rate 
the outstanding borrowings under these credit agreements were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix at the variable portion of the rate of interest payable by us on a certain portion of million borrowed during under our us credit agreement to finance our acquisition of the inseec group 
approximately million of this borrowing was repaid during the second quarter of the notional amount of the interest rate swap  originally million  decreased to million on december   and the agreement will expire on march  the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows during the year ended december    and  was not significant 
the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under our credit agreements  including the effect on interest expense of the interest rate swap agreement  was and as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we had capital lease obligations totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
we estimate that the book value of our investments  debt instruments and related derivative financial instruments approximated their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro  the canadian dollar  and the british pound vis vis the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   was not significant  and the book values of the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations as of december   approximated their fair values 
in addition  as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under our us credit agreement of million denominated as million 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
