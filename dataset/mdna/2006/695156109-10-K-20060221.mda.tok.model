item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
overview on april   pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the group  formerly known as tenneco packaging inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco  inc 
the group operated prior to april  as a division of pactiv  and not as a separate  stand alone entity 
from its formation in january and through the closing of the acquisition on april   pca did not have any significant operations 
the april  acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets 
purchase accounting was not applied because  under the applicable accounting guidance  a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december  and are set forth the below for the year ended december  in millions change net sales income before interest and taxes interest expense  net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales net sales increased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes of corrugated products compared to total corrugated products volume sold increased to billion square feet in compared to billion square feet in on a comparable shipment per workday basis  corrugated products sales volume increased in from excluding pca s acquisition of midland container in april  corrugated products volume was higher in than and up compared to on a shipment per workday basis 
shipments per workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year 
the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that had one less workday days  those days not falling on a weekend or holiday  than days 
containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in income before interest and taxes income before interest and taxes decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december  is income of million  net of expenses  attributable to a dividend paid to pca by southern timber venture  llc stv  the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a ownership interest 
additionally in  stv purchased a portion of the company s interest in stv which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december  is income of million  net of expenses  due to two additional dividends paid to pca by stv 
excluding the dividends from stv and the equity sale described previously  operating income decreased million in compared to the million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased costs related to transportation million  energy  primarily purchased fuels and electricity million  wood fiber million  annual wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel million  medical  pension and other benefit costs million  other corrugated converting costs  primarily materials and supplies million and mill chemicals million 
those cost items were largely offset by increased sales prices and volume million 
gross profit increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from of net sales in to of net sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above which was almost entirely offset by improved sales pricing and volume 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense million and related fringe benefits million  and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements million 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   increased by million  or  from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher professional fees primarily related to investor relations  legal and human resource matters million and increased salaries million 
other expense  net  increased million  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in expenses related to the disposals of property  plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with capital projects  and a portion of a corrugated products manufacturing plant s closure costs million which were recorded in other expense  net 
interest expense  net and income taxes interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from primarily as a result of an increase in interest income earned on the company s cash equivalents  partially offset by higher interest expense on the company s variable rate debt due to higher interest rates 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the higher tax rate in is due to an increase in tax accruals recorded for prior years 
for both years and  tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december  and are set forth below for the year ended december  in millions change net sales income before interest and taxes interest expense  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales net sales increased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  net sales increased due to improved sales volumes and prices of corrugated products and containerboard compared to total corrugated products volume sold increased to billion square feet in compared to billion square feet in on a comparable shipment per workday basis  corrugated products sales volume increased in from excluding pca s acquisition of acorn in february  corrugated products volume was higher in than and up compared to on a shipment per workday basis 
shipments per workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year 
the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that had one less workday days  those days not falling on a weekend or holiday  than days 
containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in income before interest and taxes income before interest and taxes increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december  is income of million  net of expenses  attributable to a dividend paid to pca by stv  the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a ownership interest 
included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december  is a million charge for fees and expenses related to the company s debt refinancing which was completed in july  and a fourth quarter charge of million to settle certain benefits related matters with pactiv corporation dating back to april  when pca became a stand alone company  as described below 
during the fourth quarter of  pactiv notified pca that we owed pactiv additional amounts for hourly pension benefits and workers compensation liabilities dating back to april  a settlement of million was negotiated between pactiv and pca in december the full amount of the settlement was accrued in the fourth quarter of excluding these special items  operating income decreased million in compared to the million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased energy and transportation costs million  higher recycled and wood fiber costs million  increased salary expenses related to annual increases and new hires million  and increased contractual hourly labor costs million  which was partially offset by increased sales volume and sales prices million 
gross profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from of net sales in to of net sales in the current year primarily due to the cost increases described above 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense million and related fringe benefits million  higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements million  increased travel  entertainment and promotional expenses million  increased broker commissions million and higher recruiting  relocation and training costs million 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing million incurred in  partially offset by increased salaries million and higher professional fees primarily related to audits of internal controls million 
other expense  net  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility closure costs of million  reduced legal charges of million  and a reduction in expenses of million consisting of individually insignificant items 
interest expense  net and income taxes interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in by million  or  from this decrease included million of expenses related to the company s debt refinancing in july the million of expenses consisted of million paid in premiums for the tender of the senior subordinated notes  and a million non cash charge for the write off of deferred financing fees related to the notes and pca s original revolving credit facility 
excluding the million charge  interest expense in was million lower than in as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company s july refinancing and lower debt levels 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the higher tax rate in is due to stable permanent items over a lower level of book income loss 
for both years and  tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  in millions net cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by lower deferred taxes of million 
the decrease in deferred taxes was due primarily to the elimination of bonus depreciation which resulted in substantially lower tax depreciation in than in  partially offset by the use of a federal net operating loss carry forward 
during  pca s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were million  or of book income before income taxes of million  compared to pca s effective tax rate of in the lower cash tax rate compared to the effective tax rate was primarily the result of reducing current year taxable income by million through available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   all federal net operating loss carry forwards have been used 
without the federal net operating loss carry forwards  pca would have owed an additional million in federal tax cash payments in the company expects the cash tax rate for both federal and state income tax payments to be between and 
the lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities in were driven by a million payment to pactiv in january for a fourth quarter negotiated settlement of pension benefits and workers compensation liabilities dating back to april   the date tenneco packaging now pactiv sold us to pca holdings llc 
additionally  pca paid pactiv million in april as final payment for pca s participation in pactiv s salaried pension plan 
the lower requirements in were also driven by favorable changes in accounts receivable million in primarily due to lower selling prices in both corrugated products and containerboard at the end of compared to the end of net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to the comparable period in the decrease was the result of higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by higher net income and increased deferred taxes as a result of the higher income levels in the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities were driven by the million payment to pactiv in january  as previously described  that was accrued in the fourth quarter of  and the million payment to pactiv for participation in their salaried pension plan in april  as previously described  of which million was accrued at december  the higher requirements in were also driven by unfavorable changes in accounts payable million  prepaid expenses and other current assets million primarily due to a federal income tax refund received in  as well as higher levels of accounts receivable million in primarily due to improved sales volumes and pricing previously described 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to an increase in additions to property  plant and equipment of million in compared to the same period in  lower joint venture dividends received from stv of million in compared to  higher cost of acquisitions of million in and lower proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and investments of million received in see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding acquisitions 
net cash used for investing activities was unchanged for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  expenditures for property  plant and equipment were lower by million in compared to  joint venture dividends received from stv were higher by million in compared to  and proceeds received from the sale of a small portion of pca s investment in stv were offset by higher acquisitions in of million 
as of december   pca had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of  shares of pca common stock from pca holdings llc for a total of million in december  and million in additional dividends paid on pca s common stock during compared to the same period in net cash used for financing activities decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to million in debt prepayments in compared to million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in and stock repurchases of million made in this was partially offset by dividend payments on pca s common stock of million in and the million in proceeds that pca netted from the debt refinancing in described below 
in connection with the debt refinancing in july  pca received proceeds  net of discount  of million from its notes offering and new senior credit facility and million from settlement of the treasury lock  which it used to complete the tender offer of its senior subordinated notes in the amount of million  including the premium 
pca also incurred financing costs in the amount of million in connection with the debt refinancing 
pca holds a equity ownership interest in stv 
in  and  pca received dividends from stv of million million net of taxes and expenses  million million net of taxes and expenses and million million after tax  respectively 
on november   pca established an on balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable 
to effectuate this program  pca formed a wholly owned limited purpose subsidiary  packaging credit company  llc  or pcc  which in turn formed a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary  packaging receivables company  llc  or prc  for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc 
both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca 
under this program  pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc 
prc and lenders established a million receivables backed revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc 
the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc 
in the event of a liquidation of prc  the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca 
credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing base formula 
as a result  the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times 
on october   pca renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional three year term  expiring on october  as of december   million was outstanding and million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility 
the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal was million 
on july   pca repaid all borrowings under its then existing senior credit facility 
this facility was replaced with a senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a million revolving credit facility  including a million subfacility for letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the senior credit facility closed on july   and it expires in pca s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of december  consisted of million of term loans 
on july   pca closed its offering and private placement of million of five year notes and million of ten year notes 
on july   pca used the net proceeds from the offering  together with the borrowings under the senior credit facility and cash on hand  to purchase million  or  of its then outstanding senior subordinated notes 
as a result of these transactions  pca recorded a one time charge of approximately million million after tax in the third quarter of the million charge includes the tender offer premium of million and a million non cash charge for the write off of deferred financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt  which are included in interest expense  and fees and expenses of million  which are included in corporate overhead 
as required by their terms  the million of five year notes and million of ten year notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in december the remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased on april  off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  that would require disclosure under sec fr  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes pca s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years term loan receivables credit facility five year notes due august  ten year notes due august  other long term debt total short term and long term debt operating leases pension contributions 
capital commitments purchase commitments letters of credit total the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of million at december  and interest payments on debt outstanding 
pca currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond the lease commitments  purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca s consolidated balance sheet as of december  see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 
pca s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under pca s revolving credit facility  and additional borrowings under pca s receivables credit facility 
as of december   pca had million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements due to the impact on this borrowing capacity of million of outstanding letters of credit 
pca s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures  debt service and declared common stock dividends  which it expects to be able to fund from these sources 
the following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of december  for pca s outstanding term loan  the revolving credit facility  the receivables credit facility and the five and ten year senior notes borrowing arrangement in thousands balance at december  weighted average interest rate projected annual cash interest payments senior credit facility term loan revolving credit facility n a n a receivables credit facility five year notes due august  ten year notes due august  total the above table excludes unamortized debt discount of million at december  it also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments  the non cash income from the annual amortization of the million received in july from the settlement of the treasury locks related to the five and ten year notes 
the amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five and ten year notes and is included in interest expense  net 
the revolving credit facility is available to fund pca s working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the term loan must be repaid in annual installments from july through the revolving credit facility will terminate in july the receivables credit facility will terminate in october the instruments governing pca s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit  among other things  the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions  incur liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca 
these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 
in addition  we must maintain minimum net worth  maximum leverage and minimum ebitda to interest ratios under the senior credit facility 
a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default  which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness 
such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indentures and the receivables credit facility 
pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of million to million in these capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital  cost reduction  business growth  and environmental compliance 
pca believes that its net cash generated from operating activities  available cash reserves and  as required  borrowings under its committed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and future liquidity and capital requirements  including payments of any declared common stock dividends 
as its debt or credit facilities become due  pca will need to repay  extend or replace such facilities  which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond pca s control 
environmental matters we are subject to  and must comply with  a variety of federal  state and local environmental laws  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
the most significant of these laws affecting us are resource conservation and recovery act rcra clean water act cwa clean air act caa the emergency planning and community right to know act epcra toxic substance control act tsca safe drinking water act sdwa we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations 
because environmental regulations are constantly evolving  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws 
for the years ended december  and  the costs of environmental compliance were approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations  including those at the counce  filer city  valdosta and tomahawk mills 
the cluster rules affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants  and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 
as is the case with any industrial operation  we have  in the past  incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination  as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as the federal superfund law  and analogous state laws 
cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate  former facilities and off site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre closing off site waste disposal 
pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city  michigan unrelated to current mill operations 
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict  meaning that liability is imposed without fault  joint and several  meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution  and retroactive  we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material 
from through  remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately million 
as of december   we maintained an environmental reserve of million relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as on going and anticipated remedial projects 
total capital costs for environmental matters  including cluster rule compliance  were million for and we currently estimate environmental capital expenditures will be million  of which million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements 
as of this filing  we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the million accrued as of december   will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact of inflation pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  pensions and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit sources  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of for amounts less than days past due their contractual terms and for amounts more than days past due their contractual terms based on our historical collection experience 
if our collection experience deteriorates ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns  allowances and earned discounts 
based on our experience  customer returns  allowances and earned discounts have averaged of our gross selling price 
accordingly  we reserve of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions reserve was million  compared to million at december  bad debt expense in was million  compared to million in the million increase was primarily attributable to increased expense of million related to accounts receivable amounts that were deemed uncollectable and an increase of million recorded in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the level of their accounts receivable balance as of december  for the year ended december   bad debt expense was million compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a reduction of million related to specific customers that were reserved for at of their outstanding accounts receivable balances and a reduction of million in expense due to accounts receivable that were deemed uncollectable in compared to inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the carrying value of inventory may be required 
raw materials  work in process and finished goods valued using the last in  first out lifo cost method comprised of inventories at current cost at both december  and supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 
pension and postretirement benefits the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
one of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates available on high quality  fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by the company based upon annual reviews 
for postretirement health care plan accounting  our company reviews external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption 
environmental liabilities pca accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 
the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs  the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  and the timing  varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies 
liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions 
because of these uncertainties  however  our estimates may change 
we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april  pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april  pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 
revenue recognition pca recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales 
in addition  pca offers volume rebates to certain of its customers 
the total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long lived asset may not be fully recoverable 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation were required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets would be compared to the asset s or group of assets carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
stock based compensation the company has one stock based employee compensation plan 
the company s stock based employee compensation plan is accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
because the number of shares is fixed and the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no cost is reflected in net income for stock options granted under the plan 
the company amortizes restricted stock awards to net earnings over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
note to the consolidated financial statements provide supplemental information  including pro forma income and earnings per share  as if the company had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the estimate of fair value requires a number of assumptions  including estimated option life and future volatility of the underlying stock price 
changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the stock options 
income taxes the company s annual tax rate is determined based on income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on the company s tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
significant management judgments are required for the following items management reviews the company s deferred tax assets for realizability 
valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions may be challenged 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return  case law and emerging legislation 
while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter  the company believes that the accruals reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
as of december   pca was not party to any derivative instruments 
as the interest rates on approximately of pca s debt are fixed  a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of million annually for the years ended december  and as of december  and  the weighted average libor was and  respectively  and the weighted average commercial paper rate was and  respectively 
in the event of a change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca s financial structure
