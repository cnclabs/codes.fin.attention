critical accounting policies and estimates the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign japan jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
we recorded a valuation for the deferred tax assets from our net operating losses carried forward due to us not demonstrating any consistent profitable operations 
in the event that the actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust such valuation recorded 
stock based compensation sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
intangible assets other intangible assets primarily relate to the intangible assets and intellectual property acquired in connection with the acquisition of global hotline over thirty six months on a straight line basis  which was the time frame that the management of the company was able to project forward for future revenue  either under agreement or through expected continued business activities with significant telecommunications companies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized 
we consider revenue realized when the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we account for certain rex tokyo construction contracts projects on the percentage of completion method and under this method  income is recognized as work on contracts progresses  but estimated losses on contracts in progress are charged to operations immediately 
we provide customer financing and recognizes revenue on a pro rata basis over the life of the note receivable 
global hotline revenue was derived from operating call centers and the reselling of telephone and broadband lines in japan 
revenue for one contract has been recognized and recorded over the life of the contract 
revenue for other contracts are considered realized when the services have been provided to the customer  the work has been accepted by the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
furthermore  if an actual measurement of revenue cannot be determined  the company defers all revenue recognition until such time that an actual measurement can be determined 
if during the course of a contract management determines that losses are expected to be incurred  such costs are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
revenues are deferred when cash has been received from the customer but the revenue has not been earned 
the company has recorded  of deferred revenue as of december  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified within our portfolio 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
debt and equity financing of capital transactions beneficial conversion features we have adopted eitf issues  accounting for convertibles securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and  application of issue no 
to certain convertible securities in accounting for convertible debt 
eitf requires recognition of the intrinsic value of the conversion option and is recognized as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible debt and as an addition to paid in capital 
the intrinsic value of the conversion feature is the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the stock into which the security is convertible into  multiplied by the number of shares 
the conversion price used in calculating the intrinsic value is the most favorable conversion price up to maturity  assuming there are no changes to the current circumstances except for the passage of time 
changes to the conversion terms that would be triggered by future events not controlled by the issuer should be accounted for as contingent conversion options  and the intrinsic value of such conversion options would not be recognized until and unless the triggering event occurs 
according to eitf  the issuance proceeds should not be reduced by issuance costs when calculating the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion feature of debt or equity instruments  depending on the specific facts and circumstances  will determine whether such beneficial conversion feature is to be recorded as an expense to be amortized over a period of time  expensed immediately or recorded as a deemed dividend 
litigation costs we are subject to the possibility of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly review the status of pending legal actions to evaluate the amount and likelihood of any potential loss 
we accrue for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss  or possible range of loss  can be reasonably estimated 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our accruals in the future 
we have not provided provisions for any litigation matters as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas which clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory 
sfas also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and we will adopt this standard in fiscal sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r a revision to fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation and this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and we will implement sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal we expect that sfas r will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec released sab  share based payments sab 
the interpretations in sab express views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees  the transition form nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based arrangements upon adoption of sfas r  the modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas r and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
sab requires stock based compensation be classified in the same expense lines as cash compensation is reported for the same employees 
we will implement sab in the first quarter of fiscal  in conjunction with sfas r 
we expect that sab will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after december  and we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  sfas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas applies to voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statement of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas effective december  sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which is an amendment of sfas no 
and this statement  a permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  b clarifies which interest only strip and principal only strip are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 c establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  d clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  e amends sfas no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after september  earlier adoption of this statement is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued any financial statements for that fiscal year 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends sfas no 
this statement establishes  among other things  the accounting for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
this statement amends sfas no 
to require that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
sfas no 
permits  but does not require  the subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value 
an entity that uses derivative instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in servicing assets and servicing liabilities is required to account for those derivative instruments at fair value 
under sfas no 
 an entity can elect subsequent fair value measurement to account for its separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
by electing that option  an entity may simplify its accounting because this statement permits income statement recognition of the potential offsetting changes in fair value of those servicing assets and servicing liabilities and derivative instruments in the same accounting period 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after september  earlier adoption of sfas no 
is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued any financial statements for that fiscal year 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

on february   we filed an answer and counterclaim against mr 
badner in response to mr 
badner s amended arbitration claim 
arbitration was held in december and january we do not expect a decision until the second quarter of mr 
badner has also filed a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york  new york county against one of the company s officers alleging defamation 
the officer has filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of proper service and personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim 
mr 
badner has cross moved for discovery and for leave to amend his complaint 
a hearing was held in february on the motions and the case was dismissed april  for lack of proper service and a dismissal of the cross motion for lack of verification and the dismissal denies further discovery 
in november   we were sued in the ninth judicial district court of nevada  douglas county  by flashpoint ventures  llc flashpoint and  subsequently  by activated matrix partners  llc amp in a cross complaint relating to the acquisition by amp of activated content corporation acc from iaj  one of our stockholders 
flashpoint claims to have provided acquisition financing to amp and amp is alleged to have defaulted on its loan to flashpoint 
the flashpoint suit claims fraud  unjust enrichment and breach of covenants related to the financing provided to amp 
the amp cross compliant claims intentional misrepresentation  breach of contract  and requests contractual indemnification 
the flashpoint claims in nevada were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in february and we have been notified that the amp cross complaint will be voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 
we believe the flashpoint and amp claims will be re filed in washington state court 
we believe there is no basis for our having been sued by flashpoint and amp and we will vigorously defend against these claims if they are re filed 
we have not provided for a provision in these litigation matters 
we believe there are no other pending legal proceedings that if adversely determined would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
we may need additional financing to support our operations and acquire businesses 
we may need to obtain additional financing in order to continue our current operations  including the cash flow needs of global hotline and its subsidiaries  to acquire businesses and to maintain the american stock exchange amex requirements of million in stockholders equity for continued listing our shares 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or that if such funding is available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us  from our major shareholders or otherwise 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we would incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage ownership of all holders of common stock 
if we do raise more equity capital in the future  it is likely that it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders 
any inability to obtain additional financing may materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our principal stockholders have substantial influence over our company 
as of march  iaj lbo fund  pbaa  terra firma  iaj  hiroki isobe and kyo nagae collectively hold approximately of our common stock collectively  the controlling shareholders 
the share ownership percentages described in this form k excludes  shares held by gmb holdings ltd  and other shareholders for which mr 
isobe has personal signing authority and  shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures 
such entities have stated in a schedule d that they may be deemed to constitute a group for the purposes of rule d under the exchange act 
hiroki isobe and kyo nagae controls each of our controlling stockholders 
iaj has the ability to cause a change of control of our board of directors by electing candidates of its choice to the board at a stockholder meeting  and approve or disapprove any matter requiring stockholder approval  regardless of how our other stockholders may vote 
further  under delaware law  iaj has significant influence over our affairs  including the power to cause  delay or prevent a change in control or sale of the company  which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our controlling shareholders have recently defaulted on obligations owing to rex tokyo and global hotline we have been reliant on the company s controlling shareholders in assisting us in raising financing to carry out our acquisitions and to fund our operations 
we may need to obtain additional financing from our controlling shareholders in order to continue our current operations  including the cash flow needs of global hotline  to acquire businesses and to maintain the amex requirement of million in stockholders equity for continued listing of our shares 
our controlling shareholders thus far have indicated a willingness to support our financing efforts 
however  entities affiliated with our controlling shareholder group have recently defaulted on obligations owing to our subsidiaries 
a subsidiary of inter asset japan  a shareholder and part of the group that controls of our outstanding shares  has defaulted in its obligation to pay approximately  yen to rex tokyo 
in april  we divested our interest in rex tokyo back to rex tokyo and we have no obligation related to the default by inter asset japan 
in addition  in september and december  global hotline made loans to gmb international inc  an entity affiliated with our controlling shareholders  totaling  yen or approximately  at current exchange rates 
gmb repaid  yen on january  the balance was scheduled for repayment by january  but was not paid by that date 
on april   gmb repaid  yen  reducing the balance to  yen  plus interest 
in light of these defaults  there can be no assurance that our major shareholder group will continue to provide financial support to the company 
we may engage in acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures that could result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as part of our business strategy  we completed one acquisition during early  one acquisition in august  one acquisition in march  one acquisition in june and one acquisition in june  we invested in a joint venture in july  and we sold businesses in december  may  july and april  and we divested a joint venture interest in october such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities on potentially unfavorable terms  incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too much of our stock as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies  the need to sell acquired technology and products into the marketplace  the need to incorporate acquired technology  content or rights into our products and anticipated expenses related to such integration  and the need to successfully develop an acquired in process technology to achieve the value currently capitalized as intangible assets 
from time to time  we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines  technologies and businesses 
if divestiture such as this does occur  we cannot be certain that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business  and collect the proceeds from the divestitures 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
our customer base is concentrated 
global hotline has one major contract with a japanese telecommunications company and two critical contracts with s networks and cubic co ltd  which help it support its principal customer contract 
global hotline s contract with its major customer requires global hotline to achieve specified minimum results or pay penalties 
in order to protect against these penalties  global hotline has entered into contracts with s networks and cubic co ltd to outsource call center operations 
the loss of these contracts would have a material adverse impact on global hotline s ability to meet its requirements under its contract with it s principal customer 
maintenance of american stock exchange amex listing in accordance with section a iii of the amex company guide  we are required to maintain our shareholders equity above  provided the company expects to incur losses from continuing operations and or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years 
not maintaining the shareholders equity above  could impact our amex listing and could cause us to be delisted  which would materially affect the ability of our stockholders to dispose of their shares  reduce the liquidity of their investment and affect our ability to obtain financing to support future operations and acquisitions 
we have limited insurance 
we have limited director and officer insurance and commercial insurance policies 
any significant insurance claims would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the future to be highly volatile 
our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in response to factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new product introductions by us or our competitors  competitive activities  announcements by us regarding significant acquisitions and divestitures  strategic relationships  addition or loss of significant customers and contracts  capital expenditure commitments  liquidity  defaults by our majority shareholder and our amex listing  additions or departures of key personnel  issuance of convertible or equity securities for general or merger and acquisition purposes  issuance of debt or convertible debt for general or merger and acquisition purposes  issuance of loans to customers or related or affiliated parties  general market and economic conditions  investor relation activities  defending significant litigation  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
the stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
factors like this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sale of a significant number of our shares could depress the price of our stock 
sales or issuances of a large number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception that sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
as of march   million shares of common stock were outstanding 
significant shares were held by our principal stockholders and other company insiders 
as affiliates as defined under rule of the securities act rule of the company  our principal stockholders and other company insiders may only sell their shares of common stock in the public market in compliance with rule  including the volume limitations therein 
we have a limited operating history 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects  having only commenced our initial business operations in april in addition  we have shifted our business from broadband entertainment channels and revenues derived from advertising to operating primarily as a holding company 
we acquired rex tokyo  one of our two principal subsidiaries  in  and have divested our interest in rex tokyo in april accordingly  unless we acquire other businesses  our only significant revenue in will come from global hotline  which we acquired in our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for telecommunication and technology products and services 
as we have such a limited history of operations  investors will be unable to assess our future operating performance or our future financial results or condition by comparing these criteria against their past or present equivalents 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we have experienced net losses since inception 
we expect our net loss from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks 
the majority of our operations are located in japan 
we do not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and a significant change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the japanese yen and us dollar would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to competitive pressures 
we face competition from entities that provide competing call center operations  including entities that resell telephone and broadband lines in japan 
certain of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing their services and products 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights 
we regard our copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  patents  and similar intellectual property as significant to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with our employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we are unable to assure investors as to the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights or those of other companies within the industry 
we are also unable to assure investors that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate 
furthermore  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
we are dependent on key personnel 
we have experienced turnover of management and directors 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management and other personnel  some of whom could be difficult to replace 
we do not maintain key man life insurance covering certain of our officers 
our success will depend on the performance of our officers  our ability to retain and motivate our officers  our ability to integrate new officers into our operations and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team 
our failure to retain and recruit officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in the telecommunication industry 
the japanese telecommunications market is experiencing significant growth in alternative carriers due to recent regulatory changes that now permit individuals and companies to choose their telephone service provider 
global hotline may be affected by the following factors that would impact its ability to operate as a call center and reseller of telephone and broadband lines in japan 
o its contracts with a significant telecommunications company may not be renewed  o the cost to hire and train staff to startup new contracts is significant  o increased usage of wireless technology for telephone and internet usage  o passing of new or changes in existing legislation  o impact of privacy laws  o new competitors  o decreased pricing  o default or lack of performance by its agents  o changes in the availability of employees or wages paid to employees to operate the call centers  and o loss of key personnel 
in addition  the global hotline business has a concentration of customers and suppliers with two customers and seven agents  respectively 
during the year ended december   one customer accounted for substantially all of global hotline s revenue in  although global hotline expects to diversify its customer base in our business is dependent upon its ability to operate efficiently by maintaining tight control on its cash flows 
any change in these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve the contract rates and to operate as a call center and reseller of telephone and broadband lines in japan 
this could result in a repayment of cash paid under the contracts  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we were exposed to foreign currency risks due to the acquisition of rex tokyo on march  and global hotline on june  and the divestiture of fan club on may  these businesses operate in japan 
we do not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
interest rate risk after giving effect to the disposition of rex tokyo  which we sold on april   the company is not exposed to interest rate risk 
the company does not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and is exposed to interest rate risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition and results of operations
