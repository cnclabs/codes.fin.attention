management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to or otherwise accepted by unaffiliated customers pursuant to customers orders  the price is defined and collection is reasonably assured

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and have been reduced to the lower of cost or market for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventory 
the lower of cost or market adjustment is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets intangible and certain other long lived assets with a definite life are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue

accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses and gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
for deferred tax assets  management assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 

table of contents in fiscal  management determined that it was appropriate to release a substantial portion of the deferred tax valuation allowance based upon the company s then current and expected level of profitability  and the belief that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be utilized before they expired 
the remaining valuation allowance is provided for foreign net operating losses 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  income taxes are required to be estimated 
this process involves estimating actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on management s estimates of future taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
stock based compensation on july   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the fair values of all share based payment transactions  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense based on the fair values over the requisite service period
