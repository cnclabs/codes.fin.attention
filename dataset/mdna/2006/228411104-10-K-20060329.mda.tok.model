item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
generally  we charge our pay television distributors a monthly subscriber fee for the right to broadcast our channels 
generally  these distribution agreements last from three to ten years  and sometimes include annual increases of subscriber fees 
a distribution agreement may also involve a payment by us for the establishment of the relationship or  together with or in lieu of any payment  waived subscriber fees for our channels to distributors for a period of time and discounts or no fees if certain subscriber levels are achieved 
please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information regarding subscriber fees 
for the years ended december    and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
currently  our channel sells the approximately of its advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units  adus  and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for advertising purchased in programs which did not deliver the ratings which the advertisers had been guaranteed 
historically  advertisers have spent more on advertising through traditional broadcast television than through pay television 
we believe that as pay television continues to gain viewership relative to broadcast television  it should attract a larger percentage of the total available dollars spent on television advertising 
also  as pay television draws audience share from broadcast television  audience demographics ie viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  sex and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products  by buying advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we have advertising sales offices in new york  los angeles  chicago  atlanta and detroit 
in addition  we have made significant investments in programming  research  marketing and promotions  all specifically designed to support the sale of advertising time on our channels 
for the years ended december    and revenues from the sale of advertising time on our channels were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
ratings among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market in  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with an average household rating for the year and th for prime time with an average household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with an average household rating and th for prime time with an average household rating  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults and women licensing revenue we license our film assets to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who pay a license fee for the right to exhibit or distribute the programming over a certain period of time 
our licensing of film assets is an important contributor to our revenues and  because the amortization of our film assets is a non cash expense  also to our cash flow 
programming our channels offer a range of high quality  entertainment programming for adults and families including movies  miniseries  epics  historical dramas  romances  literary classics  and contemporary stories 
sources for programming on our channels include the crown media library  programming licensed from rhi entertainment distribution  and programming licensed from other third parties 
prior to the purchase of the crown media library in  we licensed substantially all of the titles in that library from hallmark entertainment distribution  which is now rhi entertainment distribution 
examples of programming from our library and the rhi entertainment distribution library include  larry mcmurtry s lonesome dove  the outsider  talking to heaven  frederick forsyth s icon  supernova and larry mcmurtry s dead man s walk as well as programming previously shown as hallmark hall of fame such as john grisham s painted house  fallen angel  sarah  plain and tall and what the deaf man heard 
we benefit from these original rhi entertainment distribution productions  which are sometimes premiered and often aired on our channel 
examples of other third party programming shown on our channel include the popular drama series m a s h  little house on the prairie  diagnosis murder  matlock  walker texas ranger and the waltons 
other examples of our third party programming include acquired movies and miniseries such as the parent trap  city slickers and a fistful of dollars 
our license agreements with third parties typically provide for a license fee paid out over the term of the license for the right to exhibit a program in the united states within a specified period of time 
distribution the hallmark channel ended with million subscribers  an increase of from million at the year end 
we currently distribute the hallmark channel to approximately of all united states pay television subscribers 
the following table shows the approximate number of pay television households and the hallmark channel subscribers for each of the eight largest pay television distributors  and all other pay television distributors as a group  in the united states as of december  hallmark hallmark channel us total us pay tv channel u

adelphia is the subject of a purchase agreement with comcast and time warner 
once this purchase is completed  we expect that the adelphia systems will then be covered by the terms of the existing hallmark channel agreements with comcast and time warner 
our other major distribution agreements expire from december through december  of these distribution agreements  agreements accounting for approximately of our subscriber base at december  will terminate and be the subject of renewal negotiations prior to or on december  in october   we entered into a renewal of our distribution agreement with one of the major distributors for a period of years 
sales and marketing our primary target demographics are women aged to and adults aged to and our secondary target is adults aged to our programming is targeted to adults  but is generally appropriate for viewing by the entire family  which is important to viewers  advertisers and affiliates alike 
for over fifty years hallmark has been a leader in high quality original television production 
the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel are the only home on cable television for the movies previously shown as hallmark hall of fame  a selection of movies from an award winning entertainment series 
the power of the hallmark brand and the quality of rhi entertainment distribution combine to provide our viewers with tangible evidence of our commitment to the best in entertainment for the entire family  enhance our ability to attract advertising commitments and higher cost per thousands cpm from the largest advertisers  and provide a competitive advantage in negotiating long term distribution agreements with pay television distributors 
hallmark movie channel after operating on a limited basis throughout  we fully launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of the hallmark movie channel focuses on movies and mini series and utilizes content from our film library for programming 
the launch of the hallmark movie channel provides an opportunity for the company to build a second programming asset  use this programming asset as a value added enhancement to increase distribution of the hallmark channel  and realize further value from the content in our film library 
channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channel 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channel begins with the acquisition of programming 
we have approximately titles in the crown media library 
in addition  we license programming from rhi entertainment distribution and other program suppliers 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscribers of the hallmark channel 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes of the channels programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in denver  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to a denver uplink facility 
the uplink facility then transmits the signal to a satellite transponder that covers the united states and the transponder transmits the signal back to cable head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channels to their subscribers

amounts payable under these contracts  as well as international contracts  are reflected in operating and capital leases in the schedule of contractual commitments as of december   as shown in item below 
film distribution crown media distribution owns the crown media library  consisting currently of united states rights to approximately titles  and generates revenue from the film assets in the library by granting licenses to use the films to third parties 
we are also using the films as programming for our television channels and various interactive uses including pay per view and video on demand 
crown media distribution oversees sales and distribution of the crown media library to third party licensees 
third party licensees purchase rights on an exclusive or non exclusive basis to exhibit titles from the library in various television media including home video 
crown media distribution has a service agreement with rhi entertainment  providing for services relating to the administration  distribution and other exploitation of the crown media library  and directs the rhi entertainment sales force in all sales matters pertaining to the crown media library 
competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels have competed for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  oxygen  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channel branded with the well known hallmark name our channel is branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees at december   we had distribution agreements with adelphia  cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  directv  echostar  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber fee increases over time  although some provide for lower or no subscriber fees if certain levels of subscribers are achieved 
we expect to be able to renew these deals prior to their expiration 
see risk factors relating to our business below 
a library of popular and award winning programming and guaranteed access through long term agreements to other similar programming our library gives us control over a significant amount of popular and award winning programming that we can either air on our channel or license in the united states to third parties 
these titles provide us with a portion of our core programming  and by owning these titles  we have the flexibility to use them as needed to create the most effective program schedules 
owning these titles also eliminates the license fees we otherwise would have to pay for these titles and provides a revenue stream for us from licensing the titles to third parties 
we have a three year program agreement with rhi entertainment distribution ending december   that provides us with access to new movies and mini series produced especially for the hallmark channel  as well as to titles in the rhi entertainment distribution library which have been produced for other major networks over the past five years 
this agreement is described in more detail in part iii  item certain relationships and related transactions agreements concerning film assets below 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience launching  promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as the discovery channel  abc  cbs sports  turner network television and usa networks 
competitive risks one primary channel distributed domestically we operate one primary channel in the united states 
many competitors have more than one channel and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 
entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings have improved substantially over the last three years 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affects rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research departments at the company provide strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channel to potential advertisers and affiliates 
these departments provide data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated ratings systems npower  pnf and adviews and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel 
employees we had employees at december   and employees in april neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

risk factors and forward looking statements the discussion set forth in this form k contains statements concerning potential future events 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions by crown media holdings management  as of the date of this form k including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by crown media holdings 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes  or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
if any of management s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  crown media holdings actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
both our channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  goodwill of approximately million  and film assets of million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are not able to achieve or sustain profitability  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable  we will need to substantially increase our revenue  particularly advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  increasing the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to increase subscribers and enhance our programming  which may result in increased subscriber acquisition fees and will result in increased costs for programming 
over the last four years  these actions have contributed to increased net losses for crown media holdings 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility subject to the approval of hallmark cards to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations 
in addition  in march  we signed a waiver and standby purchase agreement  which converted million of payables to a hallmark cards affiliate into a note payable 
this amount currently is not included in our calculation of total debt 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek equity or debt financing from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
information concerning our liquidity may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  increased substantially over the past year 
the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
because we currently operate at a loss  we may have a negative cash flow and any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
further  as discussed in this report under liquidity and capital resources below  we need to extend  refinance or replace our bank line of credit on or prior to may   or to extend or replace borrowings from hallmark cards by may   that would result from the banks drawing upon the irrevocable letter of credit supporting the bank credit facility or from hallmark cards purchasing the loans under that facility see note to our consolidated financial statements  and extend or refinance outstanding notes payables to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries on or prior to may  upon maturity of the credit facility on may   the lending group led by jp morgan chase has the right to elect to forego the receipt of cash to pay the principal amount of the credit facility in full  which is provided for under the terms of an irrevocable letter of credit provided by hallmark cards described in note  but instead can elect to initiate a process to foreclose on the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings  which we view as a remote possibility  would affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company would consider various alternatives as indicated above 
in the alternative  the company would cause hallmark cards  pursuant to the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement  to exercise its option to purchase the banks interest in the credit facility and the credit facility would then be subject to hallmark cards agreement not to demand payment prior to may  we need to renew distribution agreements covering more than a majority of our subscribers prior to december  our distribution agreements with eight of the major distributors in the united states  accounting for approximately of our subscriber base as of december   will terminate on or prior to december  pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
if we are unable to renew these distribution agreements  we could lose substantial numbers of subscribers 
although we believe we will be able to negotiate new agreements on favorable terms  it is difficult to predict what the level of subscriber fees will be or whether the distributors will request marketing or launch support payments as a condition for renewal 
any significant loss of subscribers  reduction in subscriber fees or obligation to pay launch support or marketing payments could materially affect our subscriber and advertising revenues and affect materially our cash flow and ability to achieve profitability 
rhi entertainment distribution may not deliver to us as many programs as it has historically delivered 
we currently acquire library programming  new productions and first run presentations under a program license agreement with rhi entertainment distribution  which agreement was revised on october  the revised agreement expires december  under the revised agreement  rhi entertainment distribution is required to produce and deliver to us  and we are required to order and license and pay for  a minimum of original television movies and three original mini series in each of and subject to our right to cancel these productions in 
there are also other programming obligations 
if rhi entertainment distribution is not able to produce all the movies and mini series which we require in and or we are not able to negotiate a new production agreement with rhi entertainment distribution for and subsequent years  we could be forced to acquire the needed programming from alternative sources or to produce it ourselves at a greater cost and our ability to effectively program our channels could be negatively affected 
modification of any existing agreements with united states distributors could result in an increased obligation to pay subscriber acquisition fees 
several of the crown media united states existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event crown media united states enters into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the existing distributor  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
distribution agreements which we may enter into in the future may also contain similar most favored nation clauses 
in the past  crown media united states has been asked to comply with such clauses and modify its distribution agreements with certain distributors after entering into new distribution agreements 
any claims under these clauses in the future could result in the payment of cash or the issuance of stock by us to our distributors and would negatively affect subscriber revenues  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modification  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall and the additional revenue we expect as a result of our film assets may be lower than we anticipate 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
in particular  our ability to react effectively may be limited by our obligation to license programming from rhi entertainment distribution  which may be unable or unwilling to produce programming in genres other than general entertainment  television movies and mini series 
our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements  as well as greater amounts of production  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also reduce the amount of revenue we anticipate receiving from licensing of our film assets and cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we are currently dependent on rhi entertainment to distribute and maximize licensing fees from the film assets 
currently  we are dependent on rhi entertainment to distribute and license our film assets to third parties for us under a services agreement  which will expire on december  this arrangement reduces our control over the sales and distribution of the film assets and might delay our realization of the full revenue stream from the film assets 
we and rhi entertainment each have the right to terminate the service agreement on sixty days notice 
if rhi entertainment elects to terminate the agreement before we have established our own distribution network  we may not be able to establish our own or obtain alternative distribution services of equivalent quality or on terms as favorable to us 
termination of this services agreement could hinder our ability  at least in the short term  to achieve the amount of additional revenue anticipated from these activities and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we may in due course develop our own distribution sales network and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by rhi entertainment under the service agreement 
our ability to do so is unproven and will require financial  operational and management resources 
we may not be able to hire the number of employees  or employees who are sufficiently qualified  to perform these services  or do so in a cost efficient manner 
if the cost to develop and maintain this employee base is greater  or if this process takes longer than anticipated  it could have a negative impact on the revenue we anticipate generating from the film assets 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to increase significantly our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  ii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience for our us channel  iii our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  iv the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording which may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or v we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue  particularly in the united states 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill  as well as our film costs  may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have generated a significant amount of goodwill 
we ceased the amortization of this acquired goodwill  and we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected 
we also have film costs relating to the amortization of the purchase price for the film assets that we use and license to others 
these film costs are  and will continue to be  a significant component of our cost of services each quarter 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  and changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are not held by affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the proposed change in television ratings in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenues are partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
nielsen is currently modifying its ratings system by increasing its household sample size and plans to institute other changes in its audience measurement systems 
our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the natures of the changes in the measurement systems 
competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industries may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels with lower viewership  such as our channel  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channel without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our ability to achieve profitability and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and profitability  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect our distribution and thus our revenues 
the federal communications commission or congress may enact requirements that cable program services be offered to subscribers on an a la carte basis  ie be made available for purchase separately and not as part of a package of services or that the services be offered in specific packages such as a so called family tier 
such requirements could result in a reduction in the total number of subscribers to our domestic program services and adversely affect advertising revenue 
if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations  our business could be harmed 
if  as a provider of television channels  we fail to comply with applicable present or future government regulations in the us  we could be prohibited from operating in the us and could be subject to monetary fines or directives  which would increase our operating costs  and  therefore  affect our ability to achieve profitability 
moreover  broadcasting regulations are generally subject to periodic and on going governmental review and legislative initiatives  which may  in the future  affect the nature of programming we are able to offer and the means by which it is distributed 
the timing  scope or outcome of these reviews could be unfavorable to us  and any changes to current broadcasting legislation or regulations could require adjustments to our operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview current business crown media holdings  inc crown media holdings  crown media or the company  through its subsidiaries  owns and operates pay television channels dedicated to high quality  entertainment programming for adults and families  in the united states 
in addition  the company owns a film library with approximately titles 
the library product is used on the hallmark channel  the hallmark movie channel and sold to third parties 
with million subscribers in the united states at the end of  crown media holdings is the th most widely distributed advertising supported cable channel in the united states 
in  the hallmark channel also increased its overall ratings as to viewers 
we finished the year the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel for total day ratings and the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel in prime time as measured by nielsen research 
the growth in ratings during began with our holiday campaign at the end of this campaign focused on holiday themed movies and linked together promotions with the hallmark gold crown stores 
the result of this campaign was an increase in new viewers to the hallmark channel 
to build upon the success of the holiday campaign  during the first quarter of  a new programming concept  hallmark channel mystery movies  was introduced 
this new programming concept premiered on friday nights during the first quarter of and each of the movies averaged a household coverage rating of  which was a nearly increase from the same period in the prior year 
during the second quarter  additional mystery movies were aired 
in addition  the hallmark channel premiered a number of other original movies that also resulted in strong ratings 
programming successes continued in the third quarter which was the highest rated quarter in the channel s history 
similar to  and in an effort to build upon our year to date ratings performance  the channel launched a holiday campaign in the fourth quarter of this campaign was also successful 
the fourth quarter became the highest rated fourth quarter in the channel s history 
two of our movies in december recorded or higher household ratings  as measured by nielson  and all of our holiday movies delivered strong audience demographic performance 
we formally launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of the hallmark movie channel focuses on movies and mini series and utilizes content from our film library for programming 
at year end  we had approximately  subscribers to the hallmark movie channel 
as mentioned above  the company owns a film library comprised of approximately titles 
through our subsidiary  crown media distribution  we license rights in the united states to titles in the library to a variety of customers 
in addition  the company utilizes the film library for programming content on the hallmark channel and hallmark movie channel 
we have increased the internal use of the film assets as a result of the launch of the hallmark movie channel and a decision to air more movies on the hallmark channel 
as the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel continue to develop  the core focus for the business remains unchanged 
first  distribution must continue to expand 
while the ratings performance of the hallmark channel ranks in the top ten of cable networks according to nielsen  in terms of distribution  the hallmark channel is only in the top cable networks 
increased distribution can have a positive impact on our subscriber revenue depending on any subscriber acquisition fees incurred and should increase our advertising revenue as advertisers pay higher rates to cable networks that are more broadly distributed 
however  combining growing distribution with increasing ratings is more powerful in terms of advertising revenue 
as a result  the hallmark channel will continue to focus on enhancing its programming schedule through the acquisition of new series  additional original movies such as the recent mystery movies  and through unique scheduling concepts 
we plan to develop the hallmark movie channel as an additional revenue source 
it can play a role in terms of contract renewals with the various distributors 
it will generate revenue in and as distribution continues to expand  the financial contribution of the hallmark movie channel may continue to grow 
in addition  we plan to focus on library sales 
our film library is a large collection of award winning movies and mini series  which is unique in that it is such a large collection of family oriented films 
all of the above needs to be accomplished in a cost efficient fashion 
cost management will continue to be a focus for the management of crown media holdings 
current challenges the hallmark channel faces challenges on the distribution front 
the distribution agreements are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and thus rates charged for advertising 
we have an ongoing focus on growing our subscriber base 
the current and long term distribution challenges will be renewing our distribution arrangements with the multiple system operators as they expire 
see risk factors relating to our business and channels distribution in item business above 
while the economics of the renewals and potential cash incentive payments are unknown and could have a significant impact on our business  we believe that the success of the hallmark channel in terms of ratings and the environment we have created with our programming schedule will enhance our renewal discussions 
we also believe that our ability to offer to multiple systems operators a second channel  the hallmark movie channel  as well as programming for their other distribution platforms such as vod  are value added components of the renewal equation 
in october  we renewed our distribution agreement with one of the major distributors in the united states 
domestic telephone companies are entering into the business of distributing television channels to households through their wire lines 
we have reached agreement with several telephone companies which permit the carriage of the hallmark channel and movie channel and are negotiating with others 
we expect that subscribers to these telephone services will in large part be customers previously served by existing cable television companies and satellite television companies 
to date  subscribers and revenues through telephone companies has been insignificant 
three factors have contributed to the ratings improvements of the channel acquired series and movies  original productions and marketing 
acquired series ranging from perry mason to walker  texas ranger and m a s h have consistently delivered strong ratings across all day parts 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the channel s highest ratings 
original productions are significant in helping our distribution and advertising sales teams sell the channel 
substantially all of our original programming is provided by rhi entertainment distribution 
to continue the ratings growth and enhance the demographics of our viewers  the hallmark channel must continue to invest in programming and marketing 
for the hallmark channel to continue to increase its attractiveness to distributors and advertisers  it has to increase its ratings and draw a younger more upscale audience  which is generally more attractive to advertisers 
delivering strong ratings growth to larger audiences has made it possible for our advertising sales to grow rapidly over the last few years 
to advertisers  the hallmark channel offers a strong brand  positive environment and family friendly programming with a successful growth pattern 
these characteristics have enabled the channel to sell to advertisers in the packaged goods and pharmaceutical industries 
the next step for the hallmark channel will be to deliver the younger more upscale audience needed to gain advertisers from the more lucrative financial services and automotive industries 
strategic alternatives for the company see strategic alternatives for the company in item above 
international business in april  the company completed the sale of its international business to a group of investors comprised of equity partners  i and uk executive david elstein collectively  sparrowhawk  the buyer or the buyer of international business 
the sale included the international versions of the hallmark channel distributed outside the united states  the international rights to over titles in the crown media film library  and the network operations center based in denver  colorado 
the company received cash proceeds of million  net of the prepayment described below  and recognized an accounting loss of million from the sale 
approximately million of transaction costs were incurred by the company in connection with the sale 
in accordance with the conditions of the sale and subsequent settlement  the company has accrued million at december   which represents the estimated present value of the cash expected to be paid by the company to or on behalf of the buyer at various times through december  included in this amount was million at the sale date  of estimated payments  which were determined using the contractual payments due on certain lease arrangements that were assumed by the buyer 
the company is obligated to reimburse the buyer for these lease payments at or about the same time the buyer is obligated to pay the lessor 
also  the company estimated a liability of approximately million to pay the estimated residual and participation costs that the buyer would otherwise be obligated to pay to third parties through april in connection with film library sales 
the amount of this liability could fluctuate based upon the actual internal usage or sales of these films by the buyer 
any revisions to these estimated liabilities will be reflected as gain loss from the sale of discontinued operations in future periods 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded charges of million to recognize additional costs for the settlement of certain disputed items and claims of the buyer 
these charges included million related to the interpretation of working capital representations used in determining the original sales price and million related to disputed operating costs incurred at the time of the closing date of the sale 
these post closing adjustments are covered by the accrual described in the preceding paragraph 
the company will continue to use the network operations center sold to sparrowhawk for the distribution of the domestic channel pursuant to a million  seven year technical services agreement with the buyer 
the company made a prepayment under the technical services agreement to the buyer in the amount of million upon closing of the sale transaction and the balance is payable monthly in equal installments through the expiration of the agreement 
the unused portion of the prepayment is classified as prepaid and other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized to operating expense over the life of the contract 
a deferred credit of million was recorded to reflect the amount by which the million contract exceeded the estimated fair value of the related services 
the deferred credit will be amortized over the life of the contract  resulting in a reduction of operating expenses in future periods 
subsequent to the sale  the company has no continuing economic involvement with the operations of the international business 
impairment of assets please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on impairment charges for revenue our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees  advertising and film asset license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by distributors for the right to carry our channels 
we have paid certain distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channels 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense on a cumulative basis exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
rates we receive per subscriber vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms and length of the contract term 
we are in continuous negotiations with our existing distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising results 
we are often subject to requests by distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional carriage or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue will continue to be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee amortization  waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels  however  we believe that as a result of these measures  our subscriber levels will increase which in turn will allow us to attract additional advertisers and command higher advertising rates 
our channel is usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and is not generally offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which our channel is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channel alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead  we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the hallmark channel 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying the hallmark channel and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
any decreases in subscribers due to these changes to distribution arrangements in the third quarter of have not been significant 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenues and costs 
based upon these analyses  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees with each of our domestic distributors 
advertising advertising sales generally are made on the basis of a price per advertising spot or per unit of audience measurement for example  a ratings point 
thus  our advertising revenues are heavily dependent on number of people viewing our channel 
rates vary based on audience demographics  time period and ratings 
our advertising rates are generally an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels and the resulting levels of viewers watching their advertising material 
thus  our advertising revenue is a function of the ratings garnered by the channel and the number of subscribers receiving the channel 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
film asset license fees the company generates revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to exhibit the films to third parties in the united states 
we are also using the films as programming for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
customers for our film assets consist of other television channels  syndicators  home video distributors and brokers who resell rights to our film assets 
license fees for our film assets are generally negotiated based upon the perceived quality of the films  the size of the potential audience who will be viewing the programming  the means of distribution or exhibition and the length of the airing window 
the market for our film library is typically seasonal  with over half of the annual sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality is due to the timing of our customers program scheduling activities 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of program license fees  amortization of our film assets  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  administration  distribution and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing distribution universe and third party programming to support our advertising strategy 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
film assets and film library impairment the company amortizes its film assets using the individual film forecast computation method over a maximum period of years from the date of acquisition 
the individual film forecast computation method amortizes such assets in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated ultimate future revenues 
on a quarterly basis  the company assesses whether events or circumstances have changed indicating that the fair value of a film is lower than its unamortized cost or carrying value 
if the carrying value of any individual film asset exceeds its fair value  the film asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
a discounted cash flow model  based on management s anticipated ultimate future revenue of the film  is used to estimate the fair value of the individual films 
the company considers the following factors  among others  in estimating ultimate future revenue for each film a the operating environment expected for the next several years  b the size of the library as a whole  c historical license fee revenue per film  d each title s age  quality  and marketability  e existing sales plans including the amount of product desired to be sold each year  f future performance estimates  g assumptions and estimates underlying past and future estimates  and h risk factors that could effect future operations of the library 
in estimating a film s fair value  the company considers those cash outflows necessary to generate the film s cash inflows such as exploitation  residual and participation costs and taxes 
the discount rate used in the company s discounted cash flow model is based upon management s estimate of the rate a lender would require related to the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and probability of the cash flow estimates 
the company reviews its estimates of ultimate future revenues and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect currently available information 
estimated ultimate future revenues are based on the history of each film and similar films  sales and marketing plans  and other factors  all of which require significant judgment and estimation by management 
differences between amortization expense determined using the new estimates and any amounts previously expensed during that current fiscal year are charged or credited to the statement of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised 
for use of the film assets on the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel  the company estimates the fair value of the internal usage based upon the portion of the film s ultimate revenues attributable to the term of the license window 
the company first calculates the amount of cost attributable to the internal use using the individual film forecast computation method described above and then expenses such amounts ratably over the term of the license window 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the company s assessment of probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company uses a number of factors in determining the allowance  including  among other things  collection trends 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
program rights are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
crown media holdings periodically evaluates the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenues 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenues and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis as it pertains to programming licensed to the channel 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenues are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  impairment is recognized 
subscriber acquisition fees subscriber acquisition fees are generally required to be paid to obtain carriage on domestic pay distributors systems 
under certain of these agreements with pay distributors  crown media united states is obligated to pay subscriber acquisition fees if defined subscriber levels are met or in order to obtain additional carriage of the hallmark channel by those pay distributors 
such costs are accrued when crown media united states receives notice from the distributors that they have met the contractual penetration percentage or subscriber count 
subscriber acquisition fees are amortized over the contractual life of the distribution agreements ranging from to years as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the cumulative subscriber fee revenue recognized  or to be recognized  on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
crown media holdings assesses the recoverability of these costs periodically by comparing the net carrying amount to the estimates of future subscriber fee and advertising revenues 
it also assesses the recoverability when events such as changes in distributor relationships occur or other indicators suggest impairment 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on november or whenever an event occurs or there is a change in circumstances that indicates fair value might be below carrying value 
goodwill is carried at historical cost if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amounts 
however  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is reduced to estimated fair value through an impairment charge to the company s consolidated statements of operations

payments under the tax sharing agreement are affected by hallmark cards tax position and its ability to utilize the company s tax losses 
the company has received million in tax sharing payments in january and does not currently expect to receive any additional cash payments during the ability of the existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund the company s operations  depend upon the company s ability to achieve forecasts 
in particular  continued growth in subscriber revenue and advertising revenue  as well as maintaining the cash flow from library sales  are required 
as a result  any decline in the popularity of the hallmark channel  any significant future modifications to the company s distribution agreements  an economic decline in the advertising market  an increase in program acquisition costs  an increase in competition or other adverse operating conditions would impact the company s liquidity and its ability to fund the current level of operations 
to the extent that the company requires additional capital and additional drawings on the bank credit facility are either not available or insufficient  the company would be forced to seek additional funding from the issuance of debt or equity securities  a sale of certain assets or from strategic transactions which provide capital 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to secure additional financing or complete any such transactions 
the company expects to continue making investments in programming  marketing and distribution during the next twelve months ending december  however  the company s liquidity position has demanded that all areas of expenses  including programming  marketing and distribution be closely monitored and controlled 
the company reduced expenses in certain areas during the fourth quarter of and expects that further expense reductions will occur in  including  among other things  a decrease in marketing and third party programming acquisitions

such foreclosure proceedings  which we view as a remote possibility  would affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company would consider various alternatives as indicated above 
the company would also cause hallmark cards  pursuant to the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement  to exercise its option to purchase the banks interest in the credit facility and the credit facility would then be subject to hallmark cards agreement not to demand payment prior to may  due to the company s liquidity issues and its inability to meet its obligations when they come due in may under the waiver and standby purchase agreement described below  the company anticipates that prior to may   it will be necessary to either extend or refinance i the bank credit facility and ii million covered by notes described below payable to affiliates of hallmark cards

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of our investments in this category were in fixed rate instruments or money market type accounts 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be reinvested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
over time  any net percentage decrease in our interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest income 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
though we intend to use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or approximately of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of capital lease obligations  our bank credit facility  our line of credit with hc crown and our other notes payable to hc crown 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities
