ryan energy technologies  inc  another one of our subsidiaries  manufactures and sells directional drilling and rig instrumentation and data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies 
nabors has a interest in peak oilfield services company  a general partnership with a subsidiary of cook inlet region  inc  a leading alaskan native corporation 
peak oilfield services provides heavy equipment to move drilling rigs  water  other fluids and construction materials  primarily on alaska s north slope and in the cook inlet region 
the partnership also provides construction and maintenance for ice roads  pads  facilities  equipment  drill sites and pipelines 
nabors also has a interest in alaska interstate construction  a limited liability company whose other primary partner is cook inlet region  inc alaska interstate construction is a general contractor involved in the construction of roads  bridges  dams  drill sites and other facility sites  as 
table of contents well as providing mining support in alaska 
revenues are derived from services to companies engaged in mining and public works 
our subsidiary  peak usa energy services  ltd  provides hauling and maintenance services for customers in the us lower states 
we time charter a fleet of offshore support vessels  including one crew boat  which operate in the gulf of mexico  trinidad and the middle east and provide marine transportation of drilling materials  supplies and crews for offshore rig operations and support for other offshore facilities 
the supply vessels are used as freight carrying vessels for bringing drill pipe  tubing  casing  drilling mud and other equipment to drilling rigs and production platforms 
our employees 
as of december   nabors employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately  were employed by unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe our relationship with our employees generally is good 
certain rig employees in argentina and australia are represented by collective bargaining units 
seasonality 
our canadian and alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second calendar quarter of each year 
seasonality does not have a material impact on the remaining portions of our business 
our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our canadian and alaskan operations 
research and development 
research and development constitutes a growing part of our overall business 
the effective use of technology is critical to the maintenance of our competitive position within the drilling industry 
as a result of the importance of technology to our business  we expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions 
industry competitive conditions 
to a large degree  nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities by our customers and could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see risk factors fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and nabors revenues  cash flows and profitability 
our industry remains competitive 
historically  the number of rigs has exceeded demand in many of our markets  resulting in strong price competition 
more recently  as a result of improved demand for drilling services driven by a sustained high level of commodity prices  supply and demand have been in balance in most of our markets  with demand actually exceeding supply in some of our markets 
this economic reality has resulted in an increase in rates being charged for rigs across our north american  offshore and international markets 
furthermore  over approximately the last months  the dramatic increase in rates along with our customers willingness to enter into firm three year commitments has resulted in our building of new rigs in significant quantities for the first time in over years 
however  as many existing rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis  competition based on price for both existing and new rigs still exists across all of our markets 
the land drilling  workover and well servicing market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of rigs and market participants 
in all of our geographic market areas  we believe price and availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job 
other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills  the overall quality of service and safety record  and domestically  the ability to offer ancillary services 
increasingly  as the market requires additional rigs and as a result of new build capacity  the ability to deliver rigs within certain timeframes is becoming a competitive factor 
in international markets  experience in operating in certain environments and customer alliances also have been factors in the selection of nabors 
certain competitors are present in more than one of nabors operating regions  although no one competitor operates in all of these areas 
in the us lower states  there are several hundred competitors with smaller national  regional or 
table of contents local rig operations 
in domestic land workover and well servicing  we compete with key energy services  inc and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations 
in canada and offshore  nabors competes with many firms of varying size  several of which have more significant operations in those areas than nabors 
internationally  nabors competes directly with various contractors at each location where it operates 
nabors believes that the market for land drilling  workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future 
our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business  and we have numerous competitors in each area 
our canrig subsidiary is one of the four major manufacturers of top drives 
its largest competitors are national oilwell varco  tesco and mh pyramid 
epoch s largest competitors in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems are pason and national oilwell varco s totco subsidiary 
mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis 
epoch competes for mudlogging customers with baker hughes  sperry sun  diversified  and stratagraph in the gulf coast region  california and alaska 
in the us lower states  there are hundreds of rig transportation companies  and there are at least three or four that compete with peak usa in each of its operating regions 
in alaska  peak oilfield services principally competes with alaska petroleum contractors for road  pad and pipeline maintenance  and is one of many drill site and road construction companies  the largest of which is veco corporation  and alaska interstate construction principally competes with wilder construction company and cruz construction company for the construction of roads  bridges  dams  drill sites and other facility sites 
our business strategy 
since  with the installation of our current management team  nabors has adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning our company to grow and prosper in good times and to mitigate adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions 
we have continued to strive to attain a financial posture that would allow us to capitalize on market weakness by adding to our business base  thereby enhancing our upside potential at reasonable costs 
the principal elements of our strategy have been to maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
build cost effectively a base of premium assets 
build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale 
develop and maintain long term  mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors 
build a diverse business in long term  sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets 
recognize and seize opportunities as they arise 
continually improve safety  quality and efficiency 
implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so 
our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment 
the major developments in our business in the past year illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success 
acquisitions and divestitures we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower states  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil  gas and geothermal markets in the world 
at the beginning of  our fleet consisted of land drilling rigs in canada  alaska and in various international markets 
today  nabors worldwide fleet consists of almost land drilling rigs  approximately domestic and international land workover and well servicing rigs  offshore platform rigs  jack up units  three barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
this growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions 
although nabors continues to examine opportunities  there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future 
from time to time  we may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business  if it is economically advantageous for us to do so 
new rig build program during  we expanded our capital expenditure programs and are building new rigs in significant quantities for the first time in over years 
in conjunction with these programs  we received delivery of ten new drilling rigs prior to february   which are currently working 
additionally  we have commitments and options for the building of up to additional drilling rigs  of which five are offshore drilling rigs and the remainder are land drilling rigs 
as of february   we had signed contracts or letters of intent for of these rigs  for our us lower land drilling operations  three for our canadian drilling operations and for our international operations 
our customers have otherwise committed to sign contracts or letters of intent for another of these rigs  seven for our us lower land drilling operations and five for our canadian drilling operations 
additionally  our canadian drilling unit expects to add a total of coiled tubing stem drilling rigs to its fleet  one of which is already working and of which we expect to be delivered during and additionally  our us land well servicing unit expects to add newly built workover and well servicing rigs to meet growing demand for their services 

table of contents environmental compliance nabors does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position  capital spending or earnings during nabors believes it is in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations  and the cost of such compliance is not material to the business or financial condition of nabors 
for a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to nabors operations  see below under risk factors noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect nabors results of operations 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating nabors 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues  cash flows and profitability our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas exploration and production 
both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices affect the level of such activity 
oil and gas prices and  therefore  the level of drilling  exploration and production activity can be volatile 
worldwide military  political and economic events  including initiatives by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  may affect both the demand for  and the supply of  oil and gas 
weather conditions  governmental regulation both in the united states and elsewhere  levels of consumer demand  the availability of pipeline capacity  and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and gas 
we believe that any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would depress the level of exploration and production activity 
this would likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
lower oil and gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate  renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts  affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn could trigger a write down for accounting purposes  affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel  and affect our ability to obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business 
there can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries 
we operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity  which may adversely affect our results of operations the oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive 
contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
many drilling  workover and well servicing rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and provided market conditions warrant  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area 
in many markets in which we operate  the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs  resulting in price competition 
most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
the land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors 
the nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that  if not insured or indemnified against  could adversely affect our results of operations our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling  workover and well servicing industries  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing  grounding  collision  damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks of war  civil disturbances or other political events 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is 
table of contents no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
the occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks  or  even if available  that it will be adequate or that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future  so as to make such insurance prohibitive 
it is likely that we will face continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurance renewals  our premiums and deductibles will be higher  and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
we expect that we may choose to increase the levels of deductibles and thus assume a greater degree of risk from time to time in order to minimize the effect of insurance premium increases 
the profitability of our international operations could be adversely affected by war  civil disturbance or political or economic turmoil we derive a significant portion of our business from international markets  including major operations in canada  the middle east  the far east and south and central america 
these operations are subject to various risks  including the risk of war  civil disturbances and governmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
in certain countries  our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls 
in the international markets in which we operate  we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country  the imposition  application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain 
changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations the drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws  rules and regulations 
our cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 
for example  federal law imposes a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills 
as an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment  we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law 
in addition  our well servicing  workover and production services operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws  rules and regulations  including  without limitation  laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances  oilfield waste and other waste materials  the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells 
we generally require customers to contractually assume responsibility for compliance with environmental regulations 
however  we are not always successful in allocating to customers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that the customer will be financially able to bear those risks assumed 
we employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use outside experts to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts 
liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and are expected to continue to become more so 
violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial obligations  and in some cases injunctive relief 
such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries  property damage  and other costs and claims 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as cercla or superfund  and related state laws and regulations  liability can be imposed jointly on the entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
under cercla  such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress which would reclassify certain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous 
table of contents wastes  which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
if enacted  such legislation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making many wells and or oilfields uneconomical to operate 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  contains provisions specifying responsibility for removal costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto the adjoining shorelines 
in addition  the outer continental shelf lands act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites 
because our offshore support vessel operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  if the government were to exercise its authority under this law to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases  such an action could have a material adverse effect on our offshore support vessel operations 
recent legislation could curtail our ability to time charter vessels in us coastwise trade our sea mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in us waters 
the vessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries  but are operated and managed by a us citizen controlled company pursuant to long term bareboat charters 
as a result of recent legislation  beginning in august sea mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the us coastwise trade 
accordingly  we will be required to restructure the arrangement  redeploy the vessels outside the united states  or sell the vessels by no later than such time 
as of december   the net assets of sea mar totaled approximately million 
during sea mar had income before income taxes totaling million 
as a holding company  we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries 
in order to meet our financial needs  we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans 
in addition  from time to time  our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict or prohibit such upstream payments to us 
there may also be adverse tax consequences associated with making dividend payments upstream 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since nabors does not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares 
however  we note that there have been recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment of dividends 
as a result  we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future 
because our option  warrant and convertible securities holders have a considerable number of common shares available for issuance and resale  significant issuances or resales in the future may adversely affect the market price of our common shares as of february   we had  authorized common shares  of which  shares were outstanding 
in addition   common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to option and employee benefit plans  and  shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures and zero coupon senior exchangeable notes 
in addition  up to  of our common shares could be issuable on exchange of the shares of nabors exchangeco canada inc we also may sell up to million of securities of various types in connection with a shelf registration statement declared effective on january  by the securities and exchange commission 
the sale  or availability for sale  of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of warrants or options and  where applicable  sales pursuant to rule or the conversion into common shares  or repurchase of debentures and notes using common shares  would be dilutive to existing security holders  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
we will hold a special meeting of shareholders on march  to approve the proposal to amend our amended and restated bye laws to increase our authorized share capital by the creation of additional common shares 
the additional shares will accommodate a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend  which has been approved 
table of contents by our board of directors  subject to shareholder approval of the increase in the number of authorized shares 
if this proposal is approved  our authorized common shares will increase to  provisions of our organizational documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium our board of directors is divided into three classes  with each class serving a staggered three year term 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue a significant amount of common shares and up to  preferred shares and to determine the price  rights including voting rights  conversion ratios  preferences and privileges of the preferred shares  in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares 
although we have no present plans to issue preferred shares  the classified board and our board s ability to issue additional preferred shares may discourage  delay or prevent changes in control of nabors that are not supported by our board  thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizing a possible premium on their shares 
in addition  the requirement in the indenture for series b of our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due to pay a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making a change in control of nabors more expensive 
we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding we had approximately billion in debt outstanding as of december   resulting in a funded debt to capital ratio of and a net funded debt to capital ratio of both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
on february   we redeemed of our zero coupon senior convertible debentures due for a total redemption price of million 
subsequent to this redemption  we had approximately billion in debt outstanding  resulting in a funded debt to capital ratio of and a net funded debt to capital ratio  which remained unchanged at our ability to perform under new contracts and to grow our business as forecasted depends to a substantial degree on timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers the forecasted growth in the operating revenues and net income for our contract drilling subsidiaries depends to a substantial degree on the timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers as part of our recently expanded capital programs 
we can give no assurances that our suppliers will meet expected delivery schedules for delivery of these new rigs and equipment 
delays in the delivery of new rigs and equipment could cause us to fail to meet our operating forecasts and could subject us to late delivery penalties under contracts with our customers 
we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our financial position  income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by us 
legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations we are from time to time subject to legal proceedings which include employment  tort  intellectual property and other claims 
we also are subject to complaints or allegations from former  current or prospective employees from time to time  alleging violations of employment related laws 
lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world 
we conduct oil  gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the us lower states  alaska  canada  south and central america  the middle east  the far east and africa 
nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the united states and canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the united states and multiple international markets 
to further supplement and complement our primary business  we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services  including engineering  transportation  construction  maintenance  well logging  directional drilling  rig instrumentation  data collection and other support services  in selected domestic and international markets 
we have also made selective investments in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  workover and well servicing operations  on land and offshore 
our limited oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in a category labeled oil and gas for segment reporting purposes 
our operating segments engaged in marine transportation and supply services  drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled other operating segments for segment reporting purposes 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
natural gas prices are the primary driver of our us lower land drilling  canadian and us offshore gulf of mexico operations  while oil prices are the primary driver of our alaskan  international and us land well servicing operations 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years

revenues increased as a result of higher average dayrates and activity levels during compared to and compared to this increase in average dayrates and activity reflects an increase in demand for our services in these markets during these years  which resulted from continuing higher price levels for natural gas and oil during and our operating results for are expected to increase from levels realized during as a result of our current expectation of the continuation of historically high commodity prices during and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity  dayrates for drilling services and hourly well servicing rates  and our current expectation of the impact on our overall level of drilling and well servicing activity resulting from new or substantially new rigs to be added as part of our expanded capital program and planned reactivations of and enhancements to existing rigs 
the expansion of our rig fleet through our expanded capital program is expected to most significantly impact the results of our us lower land drilling  us land well servicing  canadian and international operations 
for our existing rigs  we expect the largest increase in drilling activity and dayrates to exist in our us lower land drilling operations as a result of strong demand for drilling services in that market driven by the sustained level of higher natural gas prices 
we also expect strong demand for our drilling and well servicing services across a number of our other markets  resulting from higher commodity prices  to improve our results of operations from existing rigs for our us land well servicing  canadian  international and us offshore operations 
canadian drilling activity is subject to substantial levels of seasonality  as activity levels typically peak in the first quarter  decline substantially in the second quarter  and then generally increase over the last half of the year 
we expect that the improvement in our international operations will also be driven by multiple rig contract re pricings  which should begin to impact our results in the second half of we expect that the improvement in our us offshore operations will also be driven by a continuing improvement in the utilization of and pricing for our workover jack up rigs 
we expect results from our operations in alaska to be substantially unchanged during when compared to  as the improvement in commodity prices has yet to result in an improvement in demand for drilling services in that market

the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from the addition of the two new platform rigs for deepwater development projects  which commenced operations late in the second quarter of and from an increase in average dayrates for our platform and jack up rigs from to  which resulted from an improvement in demand for our drilling services in this market driven by increased natural gas prices from to alaska 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years results did not change significantly from to as average dayrates and drilling activity levels in this market were substantially unchanged year over year 
the improvement in commodity prices  which has resulted in improved demand for our services and improved dayrates across our other drilling segments  has not resulted in these same improvements in alaska 
the mature status of most of the larger existing fields in alaska has led to diminished activity in recent years  which has yet to recover despite the extended period of higher commodity prices 
while there are numerous projects in various stages of planning that are likely to result in incremental activity  the extraordinarily long lead times and capital intensity of these projects makes it difficult to predict when and to what extent they would impact our results 
meanwhile  alaska continues to generate positive cash flow and consume minimal capital  leaving us in a good position to capitalize on future prospects in this market 
the decrease in our operating results from to primarily resulted from lower drilling activity  deferred revenue recognized on one of our rigs in that did not recur in  and an incremental million of operating revenues recorded in the first quarter of  representing business interruption insurance proceeds related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs 
the decrease in drilling activity during primarily resulted from the completion of a significant long term contract in late that has not yet been renewed or replaced and is reflected in the decrease in rig years from to canada

average dayrates and hourly rates and drilling activity levels improved as a result of increased demand for our services in this market  which was driven by increased commodity prices from to and from to the increases in drilling activity are reflected in the year over year increases in rig years 
well servicing hours decreased from to primarily as a result of an unseasonably wet summer during in certain of our operating areas  which restricted our ability to move our well servicing rigs 
the increase in our operating

the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from i increased sales of top drives driven by the strengthening of the oil and gas drilling market during  ii increased demand for directional drilling  rig instrumentation and data collection services  primarily driven by a strong canadian market for directional drilling services as the number of horizontal and directional wells drilled increased substantially from to  and iii increased margins for our marine transportation and supply services driven by higher average dayrates during compared to  primarily driven by an improvement in the offshore drilling market that resulted in increased demand for our services 
the slight increase in our operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates from to primarily resulted from an increase in revenues for our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  and rig instrumentation and software operations during compared to this increase in revenues was primarily driven by the strengthening in the drilling market in the us and canada during this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues for our marine and supply services operations resulting from the consolidation of sea mar management llc beginning in see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item and a decrease in average dayrates during compared to  which resulted from the loss of some higher rate contracts during the first quarter of and from an increase in the impact of competition in the markets in which we operated during the decrease in adjusted income loss derived from operating activities from to primarily resulted from a decrease in results for our alaskan construction and logistics operations from to  which resulted from certain projects in that did not recur in and the loss of a significant contract during the second quarter of  and decreased margins from our marine transportation and supply services  which was driven by lower average dayrates from to other financial information general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily as a result of year over year increases in wages and burden for a majority of our operating segments  primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees required to support the increase in activity levels and from higher wages  and increased corporate compensation expense  primarily resulting from taxes paid on stock options exercised  expenses recorded for restricted stock grants and higher bonus accruals during as a percentage of operating revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily as a result of year over year increases in activity in a number of our operating segments including our us lower land drilling  us land well servicing and canadian operations  and from increased expenses at our corporate level  primarily related to increased management bonuses and higher professional fees

million resulting from the redemption of our senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on april   partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately million 
income tax rate year ended december  effective income tax benefit rate the increase in our effective income tax rate from to and from to resulted from a higher proportion of our taxable income being generated in the us during compared to and during compared to income generated in the us is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate for was also positively impacted by the release of certain tax reserves  which were determined to no longer be necessary  resulting in a reduction in deferred income tax expense non cash totaling approximately million 
per diluted share 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our financial position  income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
in october the us congress passed and the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act did not impact the corporate reorganization completed by nabors effective june   that made us a foreign entity 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by nabors 
we expect our effective tax rate during to be in the range because we expect a higher proportion of our income to be generated in the us we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities  and could also materially affect our cash flows 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  purchases and sales of investments  issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion during compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during during and  net income was increased for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  and depletion  and was reduced for changes in our working capital primarily accounts receivable and other balance sheet accounts 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities totaled million during compared to net cash used for investing activities of million during during and cash was primarily used for capital expenditures 
see a discussion of our expanded capital program discussed under future cash requirements below 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to net cash used for financing activities of million during during cash was provided by our receipt of proceeds totaling million from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees and was used for the repurchase of our common shares in the open market totaling million 
during cash was used for the reduction of long term debt of million including the payment upon maturity of our senior notes in april totaling million and was provided by our receipt of proceeds totaling million from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees 
future cash requirements as of december   we had long term debt  including current maturities  of billion and cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion 
on february   we redeemed of our zero coupon senior convertible debentures due for a total redemption price of million 
because this portion of our zero coupon convertible senior debentures were redeemed on february   the outstanding principal amount of the redeemed debentures of million was included in current liabilities in our balance sheet as of december  we treat the repurchase price  including accrued original issue discount  on such debentures as a financing activity for purposes of reporting cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
additionally  our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes provide that upon an exchange of these notes  we will be required to pay holders of the notes  in lieu of common shares  cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  at our option  consideration in the form of either cash or our common shares for any amount above the principal amount of the notes required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the note indenture 
the notes cannot be exchanged until the price for our shares exceeds approximately for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter  or in various other circumstances as described in the note indenture 
if these notes are exchanged  we would be required to pay the principle amount of the notes  or million  in cash 
see a detailed discussion of the terms of these notes included in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii  item as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million  primarily for rig related enhancing  construction and sustaining capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures over the next twelve months  including these outstanding purchase commitments  are currently expected to be approximately billion  including currently planned rig related enhancing  construction and sustaining capital expenditures 
this amount could change significantly based on market conditions and new business opportunities 
the level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next twelve months represent a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned 
these programs will result in an expansion in the number of drilling and well servicing rigs that we own and operate and will consist primarily of land drilling and well servicing rigs 
the increase

we have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations 
several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of our common shares 
future acquisitions may be paid for using existing cash or issuance of debt or nabors shares 
such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors 
see our discussion of guarantees issued by nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods included under off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees below 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total year years years thereafter contractual cash obligations long term debt principal interest operating leases purchase commitments employment contracts pension funding obligations total contractual cash obligations represents the portion of our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures that were put to us on february  the principal amount of these debentures of million was classified in current liabilities as of december  represents our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes  which can be put to us on june  and can be exchanged for cash in certain circumstances including when the price of our shares exceeds approximately for the required period of time 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during our board of directors authorized the continuation of a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase our common shares in the open market 
under this program we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common shares 
through december   approximately million of our common shares had been repurchased under this program  which includes million of our common shares repurchased and retired for million during additionally  during february and march we repurchased and retired million of our common shares in the open market for million 
financial condition and sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  marketable and non marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion including million of long term investments and working capital of billion 
this compares to cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion including million of long term investments and working capital of million as of december  our funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and as of december  our net funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and as of december  on february   we redeemed of our zero coupon senior convertible debentures due for a total redemption price of million 
if this redemption had occurred on december   our funded debt of capital ratio would have been and our net funded debt to capital ratio would have remained unchanged at the funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by 
table of contents dividing funded debt by funded debt plus capital 
funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt 
capital is defined as shareholders equity 
the net funded debt to capital ratio nets cash and cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities against funded debt 
this ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus capital 
both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
non marketable securities consist of investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private us and non us securities including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities  global structured asset securitizations  whole loan mortgages  and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages 
these investments are classified as non marketable  because they do not have published fair values 
our interest coverage ratio was as of december   compared to as of december  the interest coverage ratio is computed by calculating the sum of income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense and then dividing by interest expense 
this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of cash flows available to cover interest expense 
we have three letter of credit facilities with various banks as of december  availability and borrowings under our credit facilities as of december  are as follows in thousands credit available letters of credit outstanding remaining availability we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to allow us to offer  from time to time  up to million in debt securities  guarantees of debt securities  preferred shares  depository shares  common shares  share purchase contracts  share purchase units and warrants 
we currently have not issued any securities registered under this registration statement 
our current cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable and non marketable securities and projected cash flows generated from current operations are expected to more than adequately finance our purchase commitments  our debt service requirements including the portion of our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures that were put to us on february   any repurchases of our common shares in the open market including those common shares repurchased in february and march  and all other expected cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  as discussed under future cash requirements above  our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes can be exchanged when the price for our shares exceeds approximately for the required period of time  resulting in our payment of the principle amount of the notes  or million  in cash 
on february   the market price for our shares closed at 
if the market price threshold of were exceeded and the notes were exchanged  the required cash payment could have a significant impact on our level of cash and cash equivalents and investments available to meet our other cash obligations 
nabors management believes that the holders of these notes would not be likely to exchange the notes as it would be more economically beneficial to them if they sold the notes on the open market  however there can be no assurance that the holders would not exchange the notes 
further  management believes that we have the ability to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligations that might arise upon exchange of these notes and that any cash payment due of this magnitude  in addition to our other cash obligations  will not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position 
our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by moody s investor service and standard poor s  which are currently a and a  respectively  and our historical ability to access those markets as needed 
see our discussion of the impact of changes in market conditions on our derivative financial instruments discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees we are a party to certain transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as off balance sheet arrangements that could have a material future effect on our financial position  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
the most significant of these off balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations in which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties 
certain of these agreements serve as guarantees  including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds 
we have also guaranteed payment of contingent consideration in conjunction with a minor acquisition completed during the first quarter of  which is based on future operating results of that business 
in addition  we have provided indemnifications to certain third parties which serve as guarantees 
these 
table of contents guarantees include indemnification provided by nabors to our stock transfer agent and our insurance carriers 
we are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees 
management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote 
the following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial and performance guarantees issued by nabors maximum amount in thousands thereafter total financial standby letters of credit and other financial surety instruments contingent consideration in acquisition total other matters recent legislation  coast guard regulations and actions our sea mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in us waters

as a result of recent legislation  beginning in august sea mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the us coastwise trade 
accordingly  we will be required to restructure the arrangement  redeploy the vessels outside the united states  or sell the vessels by no later than such time 
as of december   the net assets of sea mar totaled approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements as discussed under stock based compensation in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we currently account for stock based compensation as prescribed by accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and because we grant options at prices equal to the market price of our shares on the date of the grant  we do not record compensation expense related to these grants in our consolidated statements of income 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment  which will eliminate our ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and instead would require us to account for stock option awards using a fair value based method resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
the statement will be effective for stock options granted  modified  or settled in cash in annual periods beginning after june  for nabors 
additionally  for stock options granted or modified after december  that have not vested as of the effective date of the statement  compensation cost will be measured and recorded in our consolidated statements of income based on the same estimates of fair value calculated as of the date of grant as currently disclosed within the table required by sfas no

table of contents pursuant to their employment agreements  nabors and its chairman and chief executive officer  deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer  and certain other key employees entered into split dollar life insurance agreements pursuant to which we pay a portion of the premiums under life insurance policies with respect to these individuals and  in certain instances  members of their families 
under these agreements  we are reimbursed for such premiums upon the occurrence of specified events  including the death of an insured individual 
any recovery of premiums paid by nabors could potentially be limited to the cash surrender value of these policies under certain circumstances 
as such  the values of these policies are recorded at their respective cash surrender values in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have made premium payments to date totaling million related to these policies 
the cash surrender value of these policies of approximately million and million is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
under the sarbanes oxley act of  the payment of premiums by nabors under the agreements with our chairman and chief executive officer and with our deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer may be deemed to be prohibited loans by us to these individuals 
we have paid no premiums related to our agreements with these individuals since the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act and have postponed premium payments related to our agreements with these individuals 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various rig leases  rig transportation and related oilfield services agreements with our alaskan and saudi arabian unconsolidated affiliates at market prices 
revenues from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  we had accounts receivable from these affiliated entities of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we had accounts payable to these affiliated entities of million and million as of december  and  respectively  and a long term payable with one of these affiliated entities of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which is included in other long term liabilities 
additionally  we own certain marine vessels that are chartered under a bareboat charter arrangement to sea mar management llc  an entity in which we own a interest 
under the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
r this entity was consolidated by nabors beginning in revenues from business transactions with sea mar totaled million and expenses from business transactions with sea mar totaled million for the year ended december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidation financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive 
property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december   and depreciation constituted of our total costs and other deductions for the year ended december  depreciation for our primary operating assets  drilling and workover rigs  is calculated based on the units of production method over an approximate  day period  with the exception of our jack up rigs which are depreciated over an  day period  after provision for salvage value 
when our drilling and workover rigs are not operating  a depreciation charge is provided using the straight line method over an assumed depreciable life of years  with the exception of our jack up rigs  where a year depreciable life is used 

table of contents depreciation on our buildings  well servicing rigs  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment  marine transportation and supply vessels  and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value buildings to years  well servicing rigs to years  marine transportation and supply vessels to years  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment to years 
these depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property  plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets 
periodically  we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets 
estimation of these items requires significant management judgment 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property  plant and equipment are critical 
there have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets  changes in technology or other factors that indicate that these lives do not continue to be appropriate 
accordingly  for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property  plant and equipment  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation  or the methodology applied 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed above  the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive  which is evident in the fact that our property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december  other long lived assets subject to impairment consist primarily of goodwill  which represented of our total assets as of december  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable 
such determination requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review in order to determine the future cash flows associated with the asset or  in the case of goodwill  our reporting units 
these long term forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions  technological advances in the industry  and changes in regulations governing the industry 
significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
as the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long lived assets is subject to significant management judgment and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income  management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long lived assets are critical 
assumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows 
given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
income taxes deferred taxes represent a substantial liability for nabors 
for financial reporting purposes  management determines our current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
currently payable taxes represent the liability related to our income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
the changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary  management must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management has 
table of contents considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates are made for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the calculation of deferred taxes is completed at that level 
further  under us federal tax law  the amount and availability of loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests applicable to nabors and our subsidiaries 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or effectively lost upon certain changes in ownership 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
these loss carryforwards are also considered in our calculation of taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
additionally  we record reserves for uncertain tax positions which are subject to a significant level of management judgment related to the ultimate resolution of those tax positions 
accordingly  management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to our results of operations 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our financial position  income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
for the years ended december   and  management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect management s estimates and assumptions regarding the deferred portion of our income tax provision  including estimates of future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  the classification of timing differences as temporary or permanent  reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded as a reduction to our deferred tax assets 
management s assumptions related to the preparation of our income tax provision have historically proved to be reasonable in light of the ultimate amount tax liability due in all taxing jurisdictions 
for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million  consisting of million of current tax expense and million of deferred tax expense 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes 
changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate 
a change in the effective tax rate from to would increase the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
insurance reserves our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling  workover and well servicing industries  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
we maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability and automobile liability claims 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
these loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 

table of contents as the determination of our liability for insurance claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  and such liabilities could be material in nature  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to estimate insurance reserves 
for purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  reserves for insurance were adjusted increased or decreased by  total costs and other deductions would have changed by million  or fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as discussed in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions  it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations  which involved the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property  plant and equipment  and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows 
this could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
as the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical 
the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities are based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities 
these estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed 
as we have not recorded any significant impairment charges on property  plant and equipment or goodwill in any of the years ended december   and  our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable 
given the nature of the evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the application to specific assets and liabilities  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
stock based compensation we have typically compensated our executives and employees through the awarding of stock options 
based on the requirements of sfas r  which we adopted on january   we have begun to account for stock option awards in the first quarter of using a fair value based method  resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
additionally  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation an amendment to fas  we are currently required to disclose the effect on our net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to the periods presented in our consolidated statements of income  or the years ended december   and this tabular disclosure is included in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of and in our disclosure presented in the footnotes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options are critical 
the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of our stock options are based on historical and expected performance of our common shares in the open market  expectations with regard to the pattern with which our employees will exercise their options and the likelihood that dividends will be paid to holders of our common shares 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine the assumptions used in these calculations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  interest rates  and marketable and non marketable security prices as discussed below 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  which exposes us to foreign exchange rate risk 
the most significant exposures arise in connection with our operations in canada  which usually are substantially unhedged 
at various times  we utilize local currency borrowings foreign currency denominated debt  the payment structure of customer contracts and foreign exchange contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
a foreign exchange contract is a foreign currency transaction  defined as an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given future date and at a specified rate 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of all our foreign currencies relative to the us dollar as of december  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments and marketable and non marketable securities  accounts receivable and our range cap and floor derivative instrument 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks or investment firms 
our investments in marketable and non marketable securities are managed within established guidelines which limit the amounts that may be invested with any one issuer and which provide guidance as to issuer credit quality 
we believe that the credit risk in such instruments is minimal 
in addition  our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral 
however  we do occasionally require prepayment of amounts from customers whose creditworthiness is in question prior to provision of services to those customers 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
interest rate  and marketable and non marketable security price risk our financial instruments that are potentially sensitive to changes in interest rates include our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures of which were put to us on february   our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes  our and senior notes  our range cap and floor derivative instrument  our investments in debt securities including corporate  asset backed  us government  government agencies  foreign government  mortgage backed debt and mortgage cmo debt securities and our investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private us and us securities including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities  global structured asset securitizations  whole loan mortgages  and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages  which are classified as non marketable securities 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments that are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
the use of derivative financial instruments could expose us to further credit risk and market risk 
credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty would owe us  which can create credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we would owe the counterparty  and therefore  we would not be exposed to credit risk 
we attempt to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with major financial institutions that have a significant asset base 
market risk related to derivatives is the adverse effect to the value of a financial instrument that results from changes in interest rates 
we try to manage market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the type and degree of market risk that we undertake 
our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes include a contingent interest provision  discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  which qualifies as an embedded derivative under sfas  as amended by sfas this embedded derivative is required to be separated from the notes and valued at its fair value at the inception of the note indenture 
any subsequent change in fair value of this embedded derivative would be recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of the contingent interest provision at inception of the note indenture was nominal 
in addition  there was no significant change in the fair value of this embedded derivative through december   resulting in no impact on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  
table of contents on october   we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a third party financial institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of million of our fixed rate senior notes due  which has been designated as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas additionally  on october   we purchased a libor range cap and sold a libor floor  in the form of a cashless collar  with the same third party financial institution with the intention of mitigating and managing our exposure to changes in the three month us dollar libor rate 
this transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  as amended by sfas  and any change in the cumulative fair value of this transaction is reflected as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income 
in june we unwound million of the million range cap and floor derivative instrument 
during the fourth quarter of  we unwound the interest rate swap resulting in a loss of million  which has been deferred and will be recognized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining life of our senior notes due during the years ended december   and  we recorded interest savings related to our interest rate swap agreement accounted for as a fair value hedge of million  million and million  respectively  which served to reduce interest expense 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement recorded as a derivative asset and included in other long term assets totaled approximately million as of december  the carrying value of our senior notes was increased by the same amount as of december  the fair value of our range cap and floor transaction is recorded as a derivative asset  included in other long term assets  and totaled approximately million and 
million as of december  and  respectively  and is recorded as a derivative liability  included in other long term liabilities  and totaled approximately million as of december  we recorded gains of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  and losses of approximately million for the year ended december   related to this derivative instrument  such amounts are included in losses gains on sales of long lived assets  impairment charges and other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical adverse shift in quoted interest rates as of december  would decrease the fair value of our range cap and floor derivative instrument by approximately 
million 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions
