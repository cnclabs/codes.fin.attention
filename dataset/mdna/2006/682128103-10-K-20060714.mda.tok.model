overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main products  image sensing devices which we refer to by the name camerachip image sensors  are used to capture an image electronically and are used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachip image sensors are designed to use the cmos fabrication process 
our camerachip image sensors are predominantly single chip cmos solutions that integrate several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
we believe that our highly integrated camerachip image sensors enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  lower cost and more power efficient than cameras using traditional ccds 
we currently outsource the wafer fabrication and packaging of our image sensor products 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development  marketing and testing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
during fiscal and early fiscal  we relocated a substantial portion of our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
we expect to expand our testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which will also be located in china 
products and technology in august  we announced the introduction of our advanced omnipixel technology 
omnipixel technology represented a global redesign that featured new pixel architecture  new circuit design  new embedded algorithms  new materials and new process technology 
omnipixel technology also includes support for features such as auto focus  zooming  panning and mechanical shutter control 
in september  we announced the introduction of our advanced omnipixel architecture 
this architecture  which is based on a x pixel and uses a process geometry  is less than half the size of the omnipixel architecture introduced in  but with improved performance 
with the omnipixel architecture  we have significantly improved sensor performance in three key areas 
the improved fill factor and zero gap micro lens structure increase the sensor s ability to capture light  and its improved quantum efficiency improves its dynamic range  its ability to adapt to large and rapid changes in light levels 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in october  we announced the ov sensor  our first product on the omnipixel architecture and the world s first megapixel sensor on a inch form factor 
in addition to the features of the omnipixel architecture  the ov sensor also incorporates an advanced image signal processor called the omniqsp system which provides high grade picture processing and features traditionally found only in digital still cameras 
in july  we announced that the ov sensor was in volume production 
in october  we announced the ov  an enhanced sensor designed specifically for the automotive market 
the ov offers several improvements including a dual dynamic overlay function allowing for both a dynamic and a static visual aid layer text or graphics within the image 
this is especially useful for reference frames and guiding systems in backup and parking assist cameras for cars and trucks 
in april  we also unveiled our second generation  megapixel camera chip 
the ov offers a small form factor  megapixel cmos camera that we believe surpasses ccd sensors in performance 
furthermore  we believe the ov s advanced high definition  or hd  video modes with vivid colors make this camerachip image sensor especially attractive for next generation dscs and hybrid cameras  which take both still and video pictures 
joint venture with tsmc in october  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  or tsmc  and we entered into a shareholders agreement  or the visera agreement  pursuant to which we agreed with tsmc to form visera technologies company  ltd  or visera  a joint venture in taiwan 
visera s mission is to provide manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
in connection with the formation of visera  both tsmc and we entered into separate nonexclusive license agreements with visera pursuant to which each party licenses certain intellectual property to visera relating to manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
the visera agreement also provided that once visera had acquired the capability to deliver high quality manufacturing services and automated final testing services  we would be committed to direct a substantial portion of our requirements in these areas to visera  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
both tsmc and we have also committed not to compete directly or indirectly with visera in the provision of certain manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
historically  we have relied upon tsmc to provide us with a substantial proportion of our wafers 
as a part of the visera agreement  tsmc agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity to us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from tsmc  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated shareholders agreement with tsmc  or the amended visera agreement  under which the parties reaffirmed their respective commitments to visera  expanded the scope of and made minor modifications to the visera agreement 
under the amended visera agreement  the parties agreed to raise the total capital committed to the joint venture from million to million 
the million increase was designated principally for the acquisition from unrelated existing shareholders of approximately of the issued share capital of xintec  inc  or xintec  a taiwan based provider of chip scale packaging services of which we directly own approximately 
in fiscal  visera invested an additional million in xintec as their portion of an additional capital injection to enable xintec to expand its production capacity 
as a result of the increase in our beneficial interest in xintec  we now account for our investment in xintec under the equity method 
as a result of the additional investment that tsmc and we made in visera during the quarter ended october   tsmc s and our interest each increased from to  and consequently we re evaluated our accounting for visera in accordance with fin we concluded that  as a result of our step acquisition of visera and because substantially all of the activities of visera either involve or are conducted on our behalf  visera is a variable interest entity 
since we are the source of virtually all of visera s revenues  we have a decisive influence over visera s profitability 
accordingly  we consider ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture  and we now include visera s financial results in our consolidated financial statements 
in the quarter ended january  we increased our interest in visera from to through purchases of unissued shares 
in january  pursuant to the amended visera agreement  visera purchased from tsmc the equipment used for applying color filers and micro lenses to wafers  and visera is now providing the related processing services that we previously purchased from tsmc 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued joint venture with psc in may  we entered into an agreement with powerchip semiconductor corporation  or psc  to establish soi  a joint venture in taiwan 
the purpose of soi is to conduct manufacturing  marketing and selling of certain of our legacy products 
in connection with the establishment of soi  we have agreed to enter into manufacturing and other agreements as appropriate with psc 
in march  we assumed control of the board of directors of soi and as of april   we have consolidated soi 
acquisition of cdm in april  we completed the acquisition of privately held cdm optics  inc  or cdm 
cdm is located in boulder  colorado 
cdm is the exclusive licensee from an affiliate of the university of colorado of a patented technology  known as wavefront coding technology that increases the performance of an imaging system by substantially increasing the depth of field and or correcting optical aberrations within the image 
we expect that it will significantly reduce the size and complexity of the auto focus function on future camera modules utilizing omnivision sensors 
because the image is always in focus  wavefront coding technology also eliminates the time delay inherent in conventional auto or manually focused camera systems 
the closing consideration for the acquisition consisted of million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock 
approximately  of these shares were retained as security for certain indemnities given by the sellers and will be retained until final resolution  if any  of any indemnification claims  if any  arising on or before the month anniversary of the closing of the merger 
we are obligated to pay an additional million in cash upon the sale of a pre determined number of revenue producing products incorporating cdm s technology 
cdm and the costs associated with the acquisition are included in our consolidated balance sheets at april  and capital resources as of april   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short durations  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
in june  our board of directors approved a proposal to use up to million of our available cash to repurchase our common stock in an open market program 
repurchases under the open market program were authorized for a twelve month period ended june  during the three months ended april   we did not repurchase any shares under this program 
since inception of the program  we have repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of per common share for a total of million 
the current economic and market environment we operate in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
we strive to remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this technology 
the shift in global fabrication to asia has introduced a range of cost pressures on domestic manufacturers 
in response to these pressures  and in order to be closer to our primary customer base and our sources of offshore fabrication  we relocated a substantial portion of our testing operations to china during fiscal and early fiscal we sell our products worldwide directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and value added resellers  or vars  and indirectly through distributors 
in order to ensure that we address all available markets for our image sensors  we recently divided our marketing efforts into two separate departments  each headed by a vice president 
the mainstream products marketing department addresses the camera cell phone and dsc markets  and the advanced products marketing 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued department addresses the security and surveillance  toys and games  personal computers  automotive and medical markets 
in the camera cell phone market in particular  future revenues depend to a large extent on design wins where  on the basis of an exhaustive evaluation of available products  a particular hand set maker determines which image sensor to design into one or more specific models 
there is generally a time lag of between six and nine months between the time of a particular design win and the first shipments of the designated product 
design wins are also an important driver in the many other markets that we address  and in some cases  such as automotive applications  the time lag between a particular design win and first revenues can be longer than one year 
the overwhelming majority of sales of our products depend on decisions by engineering designers and manufacturers of products that incorporate image sensors to specify one of our products rather than one made by a competitor 
in most cases  the decision to specify a particular product requires conforming other specifications of the product to the chosen image sensor and makes subsequent changes both difficult and expensive 
accordingly  the ability to produce and deliver on time reliable products in large quantities is a key competitive differentiator 
since our inception  we have shipped more than million image sensors  including approximately million in fiscal  which demonstrates the capabilities of our production system  including our sources of offshore fabrication 
to increase and enhance our production capabilities  we recently completed a project with tsmc  our principal wafer supplier and one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in the world  to increase from two to four the number of their fabrication facilities  at which our products can be produced 
we are also working with psc to expand their ability to process wafers for us 
visera  our joint venture with tsmc and our investments in two key back end packaging suppliers are part of a broad strategy to ensure that we have sufficient back end capacity for packaging our image sensors in the various formats required by our customers 
as necessary  we will make further investments to ensure that we have sufficient production capacity to meet the demands of our customers 
since our end user customers market and sell their products worldwide  our revenues by geographic location are not necessarily indicative of the geographic distribution of end user sales  but rather indicate where the products and or their components are manufactured or sourced 
the revenues by geography are based on the country or region in which our customers issue to us purchase orders 
we believe that the market opportunity represented by camera cell phones remains very large 
we benefited from growth in shipments of sensors for camera cell phones on a year over year basis  driven  in part  by increased demand for our megapixel image sensors 
we also believe that  like the digital still camera market  camera cell phone demand will not only continue to shift toward higher resolutions  but also will increasingly fragment into multiple resolution categories 
in addition  there is increased demand for customization  and several different interface standards are coming to maturity 
all of these trends will require the development of multiple products 
in response to these trends we introduced several megapixel products based on our omnipixel technology more recently  we began volume production of the first product based on the second generation of our omnipixel technology which we call omnipixel technology  a megapixel image sensor  the world s first megapixel sensor in a quarter inch format 
we also believe that vga resolution sensors will continue to account for a large portion of the volume shipments in handsets during  and we have continued to introduce new products at this resolution 
the digital still camera market also demonstrates a continuing trend toward higher resolution products  with a growing acceptance of cmos image sensors 
we have continued to address this trend through the development and introduction of higher resolution products 
in april  we introduced our ov sensor  a second generation small scale  cmos image sensor based on our omnipixel technology 
the new sensor offers advanced imaging features for both digital still cameras and hybrid cameras which take both still and video pictures 
along with the transition to higher resolution products  we continue to see increased pressure on product pricing 
we believe that excess capacity on the part of ccd manufacturers continues to contribute to aggressive price reductions for both megapixel and megapixel products 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued along with the transition to higher resolution products  we have seen increased pressure on product pricing 
we believe that excess capacity on the part of ccd manufacturers continues to contribute to aggressive price reductions for both megapixel and megapixel products 
the digital sensor market also demonstrates a trend toward increasingly sophisticated optical applications 
in february  we introduced the first low cost optical recognition sensor designed specifically for the consumer toy market 
toys that incorporate this technology are able to recognize  learn and recall patterns and human faces and react accordingly 
we believe this low cost optical recognition sensor  which permits such applications as facial recognition  motion tracking and pattern recognition  will facilitate the development of many affordable smart toys for mass market introduction by christmas the digital sensor market also demonstrates a trend toward slim and thin form factors 
in january  based on the new and improved ov vga sensor  we introduced an ultra thin vga camera module which measures just x x mm 
our design meets the current trend of slim and thin form factors in camera phones and other electronic applications 
in addition to addressing the continuous demand for smaller  thinner camera phones  we believe that the ultra thin module solution may also prove popular in personal computer  or pc  notebook applications where the camera module needs to be no thicker than the lcd housing 
we addressed the trend in game consoles toward interactive applications when  in december  we announced that our ov vga cmos camerachip image sensor is featured in a video and music entertainment system from one of the world s largest toy makers 
the new toy records users with a motion camera  so they can see themselves on television as they sing along to their favorite songs 
this toy  which includes a camera  wireless microphone and special effects lenses  is the first of its kind in the entertainment toy market 
our ov camerachip image sensor introduces a cost efficient  true single chip design with high video quality 
as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
our principal competitors include magnachip  micron  samsung  st microelectronics and toshiba in the market for cmos image sensors 
in addition  we expect to see continued price competition in the image sensor market for camera cell phones and digital cameras as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and distribution resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
many of these competitors own and operate their own fabrication facilities  which in certain circumstances may give them the ability to price their products more aggressively than we can or may allow them to respond more rapidly than we can to changing market opportunities 
as a result of the increase in competition and the growth of various consumer product applications for image sensors  we have experienced a shortening in the life cycle of some image sensor products 
for example  although in the security and surveillance market we continue to sell image sensors introduced more than four years ago  in the camera cell phone market  product life cycles can be as short as six months 
with the shortening of product life cycles  it will be increasingly difficult to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
as a result  we face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders if we underestimate market demand and the risks of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products 
the shortening of product life cycles also increases the importance of having short product development cycles and being accurate in the prediction of market trends in the design of new products 
the reduction in product life cycles increases the importance of our continued investment in research and development  which we consider to be critical to our future success 
in common with many other semiconductor products and as a response to competitive pressures  the average selling prices  or asps  of image sensor products have declined steadily since their introduction  and we expect asps to continue to decline in the future 
accordingly  in order to maintain our gross margins  we and our suppliers have to work continuously to lower our manufacturing costs and increase our production yields  and in order to 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued maintain or grow our revenues  we have to increase the number of units we sell by a large enough amount to offset the effect of declining asps 
many of the products using our image sensors are consumer electronics goods such as camera cell phones  digital still and video cameras and cameras for toys and games that have particular seasonal cycles 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
once our image sensors are designed into a particular handset  the design rarely changes 
in general  as long as the handset continues to sell  the design components do not change 
the typical life of any given model of handset average nine to months and some can remain in production for much longer 
in august  we announced the introduction of our advanced omnipixel technology 
in september  we introduced our first small scale  cmos image sensor with five megapixels based on our new omnipixel technology 
in february  we introduced our new smart sensor image sensor technology  and in october we announced the second generation of our omnipixel technology  omnipixel technology 
certain risks are inherent in the introduction of such new products and technology 
during the early stages of production  production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
we can encounter unexpected manufacturing issues  such as the unexpected back end problems that resulted in low yields on two of our products  the first of which arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal we have migrated the production of our new sensors to the line width process  and initiated mass production volumes by the end of calendar given the rapidly changing nature of our technology  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter delays or other unexpected yield issues with future products 
in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products 
due to our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
as a result  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
we carefully consider the risk that our inventories may be excess to expected future demand and record appropriate reserves 
if  as sometimes happens  we are subsequently able to sell these reserved products  the sales have little or no associated cost and consequently they have a favorable impact on gross margins 
sources of revenues we generate almost all our revenue by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly through distributors 
we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  and distributors as another 
our revenue recognition policies for the two groups are different 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates reflect the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems  vars and distributors 
in general  we sell to our customers on fob shipping point or fca terms 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for shipments to customers without agreements that allow for returns or credits  principally oems and vars  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining material obligations 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
for shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  we recognize revenue using the sell through method under which we defer revenue until the distributor resells the product to its customer and notifies us in writing of such sale 
deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the amount billed less the cost of inventory shipped to but not yet sold by distributors 
accounting for revenue on the sell through method requires that we obtain sales and inventory information from our distributors 
as part of our internal control process  we observe our distributors physical counts of their inventories of our products on a regular basis 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured or upon receipt of payment 
in addition  we recognize revenue from the provision of services to a limited number of our customers by our wholly owned subsidiary  cdm  and by our consolidated affiliate  visera 
we recognize the cdm associated revenue under fixed price  milestone based and cost plus contract arrangements 
we recognize cdm associated revenue each month based upon the proportional performance of the contract as hours are incurred relative to the total estimated hours 
cdm associated revenue has not been material in any of the periods presented 
we recognize visera s revenue from third party customers when the production services provided by visera are complete and the product is shipped to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we undertake credit evaluations for all major sale transactions before we release product for shipment 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide allowances for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional allowances  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
allowance for sales returns and warranties based on historical sales returns and other known factors  we provide for estimated sales returns in the same period we record the related revenues 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net revenues 
because the allowance for sales returns is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
we warrant to our customers that our products will work in accordance with their respective specifications 
due to the cost and other complexities associated with rectifying any product defects  we do not repair any defective products 
if a product is defective  the customer notifies us and  with our approval  returns the defective product 
we then send replacement products to the customer 
accordingly  we account for any exposure related to defective products as a portion of our allowance for sales returns 
the net change in our allowance for sales returns balance in fiscal was approximately of revenues  and the allowance was approximately of total accounts receivable at april  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excess and obsolete inventory and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand for our products 
we record provisions for the cost of inventories when the number of units on hand exceeds the number of units that we forecast will be sold over a certain period of time  generally months 
because of risk of obsolescence  we will generally provide for the costs of our inventories in excess of our forecast for the applicable period 
in fiscal  and  we sold certain previously reserved products 
even though we sold the products at a price that was less than our original cost  because the inventory was previously reserved  sales of these products improved our gross margins 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide an allowance  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
given our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 
under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages of certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such events occur  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment losses 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
accounting for income taxes as of april   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million to offset federal  and california tax credit carryovers 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  when the credit is utilized and the valuation allowance is released  million of the tax benefit resulting from the exercise of employee stock options will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than a reduction of the income tax expense in the year such event occurs 
for fiscal  and  the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of the lower tax rates that prevail in jurisdictions outside the united states  certain tax credits and other factors 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal may be marginally higher than in fiscal but will continue to be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally dependent upon the proportion of our income we earn in jurisdictions outside the united states 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or require the license of additional elements of intellectual property for a fee 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results we can expect for any future period 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research  development and related selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income other income  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest net income revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our image sensor products for use in a wide variety of consumer and commercial mass market applications including camera cell phones  digital still cameras  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued security and surveillance cameras  embedded applications for personal computers  interactive video and toy cameras and automotive products 
revenues increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue growth was driven primarily by demand from camera cell phone manufacturers 
the increased revenues were due to an increase in sales of from our image sensor products primarily for cell phones  resulting from increases in unit sales  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices 
revenue from silicon optronics  our joint venture with powerchip semiconductor corporation  whose operating results were consolidated for the first time in the first quarter of fiscal  represented approximately four percent of our revenue 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our image sensor products either directly to oems and vars or indirectly through distributors 
the following table shows the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars and distributors in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars

revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table shows the percentage of our revenues derived from sales of our image sensor products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total we derive the majority of our foreign sales from customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
over time  our sales to asia pacific customers have increased primarily as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing the production of consumer electronics products to asian pacific manufacturers and facilities and to the increasing markets in asia for consumer products 
because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our image sensor products are sold globally  we believe that the geographic distribution of our sales does not accurately reflect the geographic distribution of sales into end user markets of products which incorporate our image sensors 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was of revenues  down from the we reported for fiscal the principal cause of the year over year decline in our gross margin was a decline in our average selling prices  offset  in part  by a more favorable product mix and by reductions in our production costs 
revenue from sales of previously reserved products in fiscal was million  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we recorded an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million to cost of sales as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in the prior fiscal year  our gross profit also benefited from a million reduction in cost of goods sold as the result of the settlement of a dispute related to the late cancellation of an order from one of our customers 
in fiscal  we consolidated the operating results of soi  whereas in the prior year period we accounted for soi under the equity method of accounting 
consolidating soi reduced our gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal  however  because soi s operating expense ratio is lower than ours  soi s operating income as a percentage of revenue  or operating margins  are comparable to ours and do not have a material impact on our consolidated operating margins 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we consolidated visera

our gross margins in fiscal were favorably impacted by changes in product mix 
our gross margins were also favorably impacted by approximately million of revenue from the sale of inventory that had been reserved in prior fiscal years 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  our gross margins benefited from a million reduction in cost of goods sold arising from the settlement of a dispute related to the late cancellation of an order from one of our customers 
our gross margins in fiscal were adversely affected by new inventory reserves of million and late in the fiscal year by approximately million as the result of a temporary back end yield issue 
our gross margins in fiscal were adversely impacted by approximately million in additional provisions related to the possible replacement of product which did not meet a particular customer s specifications 
for fiscal  approximately million of gross profit was attributable to the sale of previously written off inventory 
research  development and related research  development and related expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses  non recurring engineering costs and costs for purchased materials  designs  tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of acquired intangible intellectual property and computer aided design software 
because the number of new designs can fluctuate from period to period  research  development and related expenses may fluctuate significantly 
research  development and related expenses for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  research  development and related expenses for fiscal  and represented  and  respectively 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research  development and related expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel  a million increase in amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets primarily associated with the acquisition of cdm  a million increase in office expenses  a million increase in patent related expenses  a million increase in facility related expenses and a million increase in outside service expenses 
we anticipate that our research  development and related expenses will continue to increase as we develop and introduce new products employing our omnipixel  smart sensor and wavefront coding technologies 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research  development and related expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in non recurring engineering expenses related to new product development required to improve our current product line and support new product introductions  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel and a million increase in expenses for software  patent prosecution and engineering supplies 
examples of new product development expenses include tape out and prototype runs with our wafer manufacturers

comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses  a million increase in accounting expenses resulting from the work we performed to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley legislation and audit related expenses due to the increasing size and complexity of our organization  a million increase in outside service expenses  a million increase in travel expenses  and a million increase in our provision for bad debts 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in legal expenses due principally to the absence of the expenses incurred in the prior year for the investigation into  and subsequent restatement of  our financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal and a million reduction in stock compensation charges 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future due to the continued expansion of our organization and the continuing upgrade of our computer systems  including our erp and other management information systems 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in legal and accounting expenses resulting from the investigation into  and subsequent restatement of  our financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal  the costs of the litigation that ensued  and from the work we performed to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley legislation  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses  a million increase in third party commissions associated with our increased revenues and a million increase in outside service expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in provisions for bad debts

increased interest income  net  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from higher interest rates and increased balances in interest bearing accounts resulting primarily from cash from operations 
increased interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from higher balances in interest bearing accounts resulting primarily from cash from operations  and by higher interest rates

we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  and  the effective rates were  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of certain tax credits and other factors 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the mix of income between domestic and foreign entities for the current fiscal year 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the mix of income between domestic and foreign entities for fiscal we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal will be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally contingent upon the proportion of our total pre tax income that is generated by our foreign affiliates 
minority interest minority interest for fiscal was million 
there was no minority interest in fiscal and fiscal approximately million represents the interest that we do not own in the net income of soi  which we included in our consolidated operating results for the first time beginning in the three months ended july  approximately million represents the interest that we do not own in the net income of visera  which we included in our consolidated operating results for the first time beginning in the three months ended october  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
liquidity our working capital increased by approximately million to million as of april  from million as of april  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million increase in accounts receivable  net  consistent with the increase in revenues from prior year levels 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in accounts payable  a million decrease in short term investments  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities to support increased levels of operations  a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes and a million decrease in inventories 
as of january   as a result of an accounting interpretation which was published on march   we revised the classification of our holdings of variable rate demand notes 
the new interpretation draws a distinction between variable rate demand notes where the notes are liquidated prior to final maturity by putting them to the original issuer  in which case they are classified as cash  and cases where they are liquidated prior to final maturity by putting them to a third party remarketer in which case they are classified as short term securities 
the variable rate demand notes that we held at april  were all of the latter variety  and accordingly are classified as short term investments for all periods presented 
in the three months ended october   we consolidated for the first time our affiliate  visera 
visera maintains three unsecured lines of credit with three commercial banks and one unsecured line of credit with a financial institution  which together provide a total of approximately million in available credit 
all borrowings under the four lines of credit bear interest at the market interest rate prevailing at the time of borrowing 
there are no financial covenant requirements for these facilities 
at april   there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
in march  we assumed control of the board of directors of soi and as of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued april   we consolidated soi 
soi maintains four unsecured lines of credit with two commercial banks  which provide a total of approximately million in available credit 
all borrowings under the four lines of credit maintained by soi bear interest at the market interest rate prevailing at the time of borrowing 
there are no financial covenant requirements for these facilities and at april   there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal  adjusted for non cash charges of million in depreciation and amortization  million in the minority interest in the net income of consolidated affiliates and million in tax benefits from stock option exercises  a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes and a million decrease in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and million increase in accounts receivable  net 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the higher level of revenues during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in days of sales outstanding to days as of april  from days as of april  the million decrease in inventories was attributable to our reduction of finished goods inventories late in the fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in work in process inventory 
inventory turns increased to as of april  from as of april  for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal  adjusted for non cash charges of million in depreciation and amortization and million in tax benefits from stock option exercises  and a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in refundable and deferred income taxes and a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable  net  and a million decrease in accounts payable 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the higher level of revenues during fiscal  combined with an increase in days of sales outstanding to days as of april  from days as of april  the million increase in inventories was attributable to our expansion of work in process inventories late in the fiscal year in anticipation of increased future sales of our then new omnipixel products 
inventory turns decreased to as of april  from as of april   as we increased inventory levels to reduce supply constraints 
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal  our cash used in investing activities decreased to approximately million from million for fiscal the cash used in fiscal consisted of million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million of in purchases of long term investments  and million in purchases of intangible assets 
these uses were partially offset by a million in proceeds from the consolidation of visera  net of cash payments and million in net proceeds from the sales or maturities of short term investments

these uses were partially offset by million in proceeds from the consolidation of soi and a million reduction in restricted cash as a result of the settlement of court proceedings and the subsequent release of a bond filed pursuant to those proceedings 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in this report  we have revised the classification of certain previously reported amounts to conform to the current period presentation 
we revised the classification of certain variable rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments as of january  and for all prior periods 
as of april  and  we held approximately million and million of these variable rate demand notes  respectively 
these revisions had no impact on our results of operations

for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities decreased to approximately million from million for fiscal primarily due to approximately million in net proceeds in fiscal resulting from our follow on public offering of common stock in july in addition  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through our employee stock purchase plan declined to approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal capital resources we currently expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash that we anticipate to be generated from business operations  to be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable capital requirements 
other than normal working capital requirements  we expect our capital requirements in fiscal to consist primarily of funding required to expand the wafer packaging capacity available to us and to expand our testing capacity 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we are obligated to pay an additional million in cash upon the sale of a pre determined number of revenue producing products incorporating cdm s technology 
cdm and the costs associated with the acquisition are included in our consolidated balance sheets at april  and in june  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of our available cash in an open market program to repurchase our common stock 
repurchases under the open market program were authorized for a twelve month period ended june  as of april   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
our ability to generate cash from operations in the future is subject to substantial risks described above under item a

we established this subsidiary as part of our efforts to increase capacity and reduce costs for testing our image sensor products 
under an agreement with the chinese government  the date by which the remaining million of registered capital must be funded is now january on august   our wholly owned subsidiary  omnivision international holding ltd  entered into an amended and restated shareholders agreement  or the amended visera agreement  with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  or tsmc  visera technologies company  ltd  or visera  and visera holding company  or visera cayman 
in order to provide greater financial and fiscal flexibility to visera  in connection with the amended visera agreement  the parties formed visera cayman  a company incorporated in the cayman islands 
visera will become a wholly owned subsidiary of visera cayman and visera cayman will complete the transactions contemplated by the amended visera agreement 
the amended visera agreement amended and restated the original shareholders agreement that the parties entered into on october   pursuant to which the company and tsmc agreed to form visera  a joint venture in taiwan  for the purposes of providing manufacturing services and automated final testing services related to cmos image sensors 
in november  pursuant to the terms of the original shareholders agreement  we contributed million in cash to visera and granted a non exclusive license to certain of our manufacturing and automated final testing technologies and patents 
in september  we contributed a further million to visera cayman 
in november  pursuant to the amended visera agreement  we contributed an additional million in cash to visera cayman 
as a result of our step acquisition  and in accordance with the provisions of fin  we consolidated the results of visera beginning in the fiscal quarter ended october  see note in our consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the amended visera agreement  the parties reaffirmed their respective commitments to visera  and expanded the scope of and made certain modifications to the original shareholders agreement 
in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued particular  the parties agreed to raise the total capital committed to the joint venture from million to million  which commitments may be made in the form of cash or asset contributions 
the parties have equal interests in visera and visera cayman 
to date we have contributed million to visera and visera cayman 
a minimum of an additional million in cash or asset contributions will be made by each of the parties  with the remaining million to be made by additional investors  additional contributions by the parties  or a combination thereof  provided that the parties have and will maintain equal interests in visera cayman 
at a future date yet to be determined  we expect to contribute approximately million of assets to the joint venture  including technology  plant and equipment currently owned by us or to be purchased with funds for existing commercial commitments 
to the extent  if any  that the value of the assets contributed exceeds the value of our commitment  we will receive cash from visera cayman 
pursuant to the terms of the amended visera agreement  visera cayman used approximately million of the million increase in the total capital commitment for the acquisition of approximately of the issued shares of xintec  of which we own separately and directly approximately all other material terms of the original shareholders agreement remain in effect

recent accounting pronouncements on december   fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments  or sbps  to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
as required by sfas no 
r  as amended by the securities and exchange commission in april  we plan to adopt sfas no 
r in our fiscal quarter ending july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we will recognize sbp compensation expense for awards issued after may  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to may   we will recognize sbp compensation expense based on fasb interpretation accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas r and expect the impact upon adoption in fiscal year to have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations although it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
the exact impact will be dependent on the transition method  the option pricing model used to compute fair values  and the inputs to that model 
on march   the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the interaction between sfas r  shared based payment  and certain sec rules and regulations 
sab provides guidance that may simplify some of sfas r s 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued implementation challenges and enhance the information that investors receive 
we will apply the principles of sab no 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas r fsp r 
fsp r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no 
r 
in accordance with this standard  a grant date of an award exists if a the award is a unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we will adopt this standard when we adopt sfas no 
r  and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the accumulated paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating this transition method 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at january   we had no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
it also clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 
 and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
furthermore  sfas no 
clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and it amends fasb statement no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after september  we do not expect the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
to impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sell our products globally  in particular to branded customers  contract manufacturers  vars and distributors in china  hong kong  japan  korea and taiwan 
the great majority of our transactions with our customers and vendors are denominated in us dollars 
the expenses we incur in currencies other than us dollars include certain costs affecting gross profit  selling  general and administrative and research  development and related expenses  which are primarily incurred in china  where the chinese yuan renminbi cny is the local currency and taiwan  where the new taiwan dollar is the local currency 
historically  the chinese government benchmarked the cny exchange ratio against the us dollar  thereby mitigating the associated foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
however  in july  the chinese central bank announced that  in the future  it would benchmark the cny against a basket of currencies which allowed the cny to appreciate by approximately two percent against the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our wholly owned subsidiaries are the local currencies with the exception of our subsidiary located in hong kong  omnivision technologies hong kong company limited  for which the functional currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our two consolidated affiliates  visera and soi  is the new taiwan dollar 
transaction gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies are included in other income expense  net for the periods presented 
the amounts of transaction gains and losses for fiscal  and were not material 
given that the only expenses that we incur in currencies other than us dollars are certain costs which historically have not been a significant percentage of our revenues  we do not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is significant 
consequently  we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on our future net income or cash flows 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments as we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and results of operations 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit issued by banks  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase  with the exception of auction rate securities  which bear a maturity date of up to thirty years and are re negotiated every days and variable rate demand notes which have a maturity of up to years and the interest rate being reset every seven days 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates
