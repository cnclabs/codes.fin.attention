item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a specialty insurance company that provides customized insurance products and solutions to small and medium sized businesses in industries that we believe are underserved by the standard insurance market 
for twenty years  we have developed specialized insurance coverages and alternative risk transfer products not generally available to our customers in the standard insurance market because of the unique characteristics of the risks involved and the associated needs of the insureds 
we specialize in underwriting these products for insureds with environmental risks and construction risks as well as in developing programs for other specialty classes of risks 
during  we changed our segment reporting to coincide with our strategic direction 
in our segment reporting for periods prior to the year ended december   we segregated our business into real estate operations  insurance operations and other which included realized gains and losses on investments and rescission expenses 
we continue to segregate our business into real estate operations  insurance operations and other  but the insurance operations segment is further classified into three additional segments excess and surplus lines  alternative risk transfer and runoff 
the excess and surplus lines segment is further classified into three business lines environmental  construction and surety 
the alternative risk transfer segment is further classified into two business lines specialty programs and fully funded 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

liquidity and capital resources the company meets its cash requirements and finances its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
since the company has operated in a hardening market with increased insurance premium rates for general liability coverages and increased fees for program business opportunities 
during and  the company began to experience a leveling of premium rates due to entrance of new insurance competitors and overall market conditions 
the company s primary sources of short term cash flow are premium writings and investment income and income from real estate development sales 
short term cash requirements relate to claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits  real estate development expenses and other operating expenses 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of settlements of unpaid claims  the company s future liquidity requirements may vary  therefore  the company has structured its investment portfolio maturities to help mitigate the variations in those factors 
the company believes its current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of its business and its invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of its insurance business 
however  the company does expect to grow its business  in which event  it will need to raise additional capital 
net cash provided from operations was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow from operations between and was primarily caused by increased loss payments  which increased to million from million

see legal proceedings for additional information 
the company s ability to pay future dividends to shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate earnings from which to pay dividends 
the jurisdictions in which the company and its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
given the company s growth and the capital requirements associated with that growth  the company does not anticipate paying dividends on the common shares in the near future 
the company substantially completed the harbour village project in the estimated completion cost for the remainder of harbour village is approximately million and represents amounts needed to complete construction of a beach club and manage remaining warranty claims on closed condominium units 
an accrual of this amount has been established 
management believes that cash on hand at harbour village will meet the remaining liquidity needs of harbour village 
to further provide for the capital requirements associated with our current growth strategy  the company entered into the following arrangements 
in may  in conjunction with american safety capital trust  a non consolidated owned subsidiary  the company issued a year trust preferred obligation in the amount of million 
this obligation bears interest at the three month london interbank offer rate libor plus  is payable on a quarterly basis and may be called solely at our option after five years 
in order to hedge this obligation for the first five years  the company entered into an interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of for five years 
in september  in conjunction with american safety capital trust ii  a non consolidated owned subsidiary  the company issued a year trust preferred obligation in the amount of million 
this obligation bears interest at three month libor plus  is payable on a quarterly basis and may be called solely at our option after five years 
in order to hedge this obligation for the first five years  the company entered into an interest rate swap with an interest rate of for five years 
in november  the company completed a secondary offering of over million common shares whereby the company received million of additional capital 
additionally  in november  in conjunction with american safety capital trust iii  the company issued a year trust preferred obligation in the amount of million 
this obligation bears a fixed interest rate of for the first five years  and a floating rate of three month libor plus thereafter 
at the current time  the company does not anticipate entering into an interest rate swap with respect to this issuance 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis and the securities may be called solely at the company s option after five years 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations in thousands as of december  were less than more than total year year s years years long term debt  interest    operating leases  total contractual obligations    the above table includes all interest payments through the expiration of interest rate swaps as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at that time the company may redeem the debt or continue with variable interest payments 
all amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates 
variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on current interest rates 
as a result of applying current interest rates to the respective libor for each capital trust  the interest rate is  and for american safety capital trust  american safety capital trust ii and american safety capital trust iii  respectively 
these rates are used to calculate the variable interest rate obligations through maturity 
fixed rates include  where applicable  the effects of interest rate derivatives employed to manage such interest rate risk 
for these purposes routine purchase of services  including insurance  that are expected to be used in the ordinary course of the company s business have been excluded 
more information about our contractual obligations is in note to our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
investments 
we routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of distressed investments  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors including but not limited to x percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the declin e has occurred  x recoverability of principal and interest  x market conditions  x ability to hold the investment to maturity  x a pattern of continuing operating losses of the issuer  x rating agency actions that affect the issuer s credit status  x adverse changes in the issuer s availability of production resources  reve nue sources  technological conditions  and x adverse changes in the issuer s economic  regulatory or political environm ent 
reserves 
certain of our insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation  construction  and workers compensation risks  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
claims made policies provide coverage for claims that are reported during the policy period 
occurrence form policies provide coverage for claims that occur during the policy period regardless of when they are reported 
we are required by our regulators to maintain reserves to cover the unpaid portion of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to i reported claims and ii ibnr claims 
a full actuarial analysis is performed to estimate all of our unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our contracts and agreements 
in evaluating whether the reserves are reasonable for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  it is necessary to project future losses and loss adjustment expenses payments 
it is certain that the actual future losses and loss adjustment expenses will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the projections 
if the net loss reserves were to increase by this would reduce pre tax income by million 
if the net loss reserves were to decrease by this would increase pre tax income by million 
with respect to reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis 
the reserve amounts on each reported claim are determined by taking into account the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new information becomes available  appropriate adjustments are made to reserves 
in establishing reserves  we employ several methods in determining our ultimate losses i the expected loss ratio method  ii the loss development method based on paid and reported losses  and iii the bornhuetter ferguson method based on expected loss ratios  paid losses and reported losses 
the expected loss ratio method incorporates industry expected losses which are adjusted for our historical loss experience 
the loss development method relies on industry payment and reporting patterns to develop our estimated losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is a combination of the other two methods  using expected loss ratios to produce expected losses  then applying loss payment and reporting patterns to our expected losses to produce our expected ibnr losses 
we review the ultimate projections from all three methods and  based on the merits of each method  determine our estimated ultimate losses 
in response to the reserve development experienced in the first two quarters of in our excess and surplus lines segment and management s concern that existing reserves for this segment might be inadequate  we commenced an actuarial reserve evaluation 
this evaluation analyzed reserves by specific risk categories within our excess and surplus lines segment  such as general liability for building owners and california contractors in addition to analyzing by a single risk category for the entire excess and surplus lines segment 
the results of the specific risk analysis were then compared to the single risk analysis in determining the final carried reserves 
the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance our ultimate liabilities will not materially exceed our reserves 
for more information on our reserves  see business losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves 
reinsurance 
ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and settlement expenses are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the related liabilities  since reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers 
our policy is to periodically charge to earnings  in the form of an allowance  an estimate of unrecoverable amounts from troubled or insolvent reinsurers 
we believe that current reserve levels for uncollectible reinsurance are sufficient to cover our exposures 
policy acquisition costs 
we defer commissions and premium taxes that are related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
this would also give effect to the premiums to be earned and anticipated losses and settlement expenses as well as certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premiums are earned 
judgments as to the ultimate recoverability of such deferred costs are highly dependent upon estimated future loss costs associated with the premiums written 
deferred income taxes 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax asset  that we believe will not be realized 
the majority of our deferred tax assets associated with the harbour village project were realized in the majority of our deferred taxes associated with our premium writings will be realized over the policy period and payout of related claims 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets  therefore no valuation allowance has been established 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on deferred tax assets 
recognition of premium income 
general liability premiums are estimated based upon the annual revenues of the underlying insureds 
additional or return premiums are recognized for differences between provisional premiums billed and estimated ultimate general liability premiums due when the final audit is complete after the policy has expired

consequently  we attempt  in establishing our premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation

our consolidated balance sheets include assets whose estimated fair values are subject to market risk

we have no direct commodity or foreign exchange risk as of december  the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio at december  was million  of which was invested in fixed maturities and short term investments and was invested in equities 
interest rate risk 
our fixed rate holdings are invested predominantly in high quality corporate  government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations 
the fixed rate portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  assuming all other factors remain constant as interest rates rise  their fair values decline and as interest rates fall  their fair values rise 
the changes in the fair market value of the fixed rate portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we work to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our fixed rate portfolio 
the effective duration of the fixed rate portfolio is managed with consideration given to the estimated payout timing of our liabilities 
we have investment policies which limit the maximum duration and maturity of individual securities within the portfolio and set target levels for average duration and maturity of the entire portfolio
