item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with elestat and restasis  potential competition associated with our product candidates  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for one of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
these risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our operating expenses are difficult to predict and will depend on several factors 
research and development expenses  including expenses for drug synthesis and manufacturing  preclinical testing and clinical research activities  will depend on the ongoing requirements of our drug development programs  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of research and development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing  other discovery and basic research activities  and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to commercialize our products 
once again  management may in some cases be able to control the timing and magnitude of these expenses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering  developing and commercializing prescription pharmaceutical products in disease areas with significant commercial potential and unmet medical needs 
our goal is to build and commercialize a sustainable pipeline of innovative new treatments based upon our technical and scientific expertise  focusing in the ophthalmic and respiratory allergy therapeutic areas 
our ophthalmic products and product candidates are currently concentrated in the allergic conjunctivitis  dry eye disease and glaucoma indications 
our respiratory allergy product candidates are currently concentrated in the 
table of contents treatment of respiratory complications of cystic fibrosis and seasonal allergic rhinitis 
in addition  we also have an antiplatelet product candidate that we are testing in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures but it could be useful in other cardiovascular indications 
we were incorporated in october and commenced operations in march following our first substantial financing and licensing of the initial technology from unc 
we are located in durham  north carolina  adjacent to the research triangle park 
we co promote elestat and restasis in the united states under agreements with allergan and we receive co promotion revenue based upon net sales of these products 
in january  we began co promoting restasis for the treatment of dry eye disease 
in february  we launched elestat for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis 
see part i of this report for a full discussion of our co promotion agreements with allergan and other significant collaborative agreements 
in june  we submitted an nda to the fda for our dry eye product candidate  diquafosol  and were granted a priority review designation in july since  we have received two approvable letters from the fda  the last in december we are working with allergan to determine a european regulatory filing strategy for diquafosol for the treatment of dry eye disease 
see part i of this report for a full discussion of our diquafosol program for the treatment of dry eye disease and other product candidates in clinical development 
in the first quarter of  we emerged out of the development stage  having transformed into a commercial organization  and began receiving co promotion revenue from the commercial product sales of elestat and restasis 
previously  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to the discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as the establishment of strategic partnerships 
prior to  our revenues consisted of payments under our various corporate partnerships established for the development and commercialization of our products when approved 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock  and  to a lesser extent  with revenue from corporate partnerships  including co promotion revenue 
co promotion revenue from elestat and restasis did not exceed our total operating expenses in we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis as situations change  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  recognition of revenue from product co promotion is affected by certain estimates and judgments made by allergan on which we rely in recording this revenue 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  taxes  clinical trial  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other service liabilities 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product co promotion based on net sales for elestat and restasis  as defined in the co promotion agreements  and as reported to us by our collaborative partner  allergan 
accordingly  our co promotion revenue is based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy  other accounting policies and the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
allergan recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the co promotion agreements provide for gross sales to be reduced by estimates of sales returns  credits and allowances  normal trade and cash discounts  managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs as defined in the agreements  all of which are determined by allergan and are outside our control 
we also reduce gross revenues for incentive programs we manage  estimating the proportion of sales that are subject to such incentive programs and reducing revenue appropriately 
under the co promotion agreement for elestat  we are obligated to meet predetermined minimum annual net sales performance levels 
if the annual minimum is not satisfied  we record revenues using a reduced percentage of net sales based upon our level of achievement of predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
amounts contractually due from allergan in excess of recorded co promotion revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize milestone revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner have met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of ongoing research and clinical development commitment 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon achievement of development milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues ratably over the period of our research and development commitment 
the recognition period begins at the date the milestone is achieved and acknowledged by the collaborative partner  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner  and ends on the date that we have fulfilled our research and development commitment 
this period is based on estimates by management and the progress towards milestones in our collaborative agreements 
the estimate is subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
this may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period 
no milestone revenue under these agreements has been recognized for the years ended december  and in the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from certain contractual milestones 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  against all potential tax assets due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide clinical  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
we monitor all significant research and development  manufacturing  promotion and marketing and other service activities and the progression of work related to these activities 
we estimate the underlying obligation for each activity based upon our estimate of the amount of work performed and compare the estimated obligation against the amount that has been invoiced 
because of the nature of certain 
table of contents contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
we record the larger of our estimated obligation or invoiced amounts for completed service 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimate 
stock option expense as of january   we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock option awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and will recognize compensation cost ratably over the vesting periods of our awards 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
significant management judgment is required in determining future stock price volatility to be used in the valuation of the options 
we use a blended volatility calculation utilizing volatility of peer group companies with similar operations and financial structures in addition to our own historical volatility 
we will use the modified prospective method in recognizing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in this section of the report as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and concentrations of risk for additional discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our costs of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in revenue  as compared to  was due to significantly increased co promotion revenue from net sales of both elestat and restasis 
this increase is attributable to a full year of co promotion activities in for both products  increased market share for elestat  and increased acceptance of restasis  the only approved prescription product indicated for dry eye disease  as well as a scheduled increase of the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we are entitled effective april 
in  the revenue generated from our commercial organization exceeded our selling and marketing expenses 
when compared to  co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat increased and co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis increased 
the change in revenue in as compared to related to our recognition of co promotion revenue from elestat and restasis commercial product sales in as compared to revenue recognized from milestone payments and the amortization of deferred revenue under certain of our collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners during all deferred revenue under these agreements was fully amortized during no milestone revenue under these agreements has been recognized for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we began realizing co promotion revenue from elestat beginning in february all of our revenue related to elestat is from net sales in the united states according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
elestat is a seasonal product with product demand mirroring seasonal trends for topical allergic 
table of contents conjunctivitis products whereby there is usually a large increase in sales during the spring and a lesser increase during the summer and fall 
revenue from net sales of elestat in the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in elestat is the second most prescribed allergic conjunctivitis product in the united states  based upon weekly prescription volume as reported by ims health and continues to increase market share in both new prescriptions and total prescriptions 
based upon weekly national prescription data from ims health for the week ending december   elestat has achieved a market share of approximately for both new prescription volume and total prescription volume in our target universe  the top highest prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists  and allergists in each of our sales territories 
comparatively  for the week ending december   elestat had a market share of approximately in new prescription volume and approximately in total prescription volume in our target universe 
also  we have recently achieved approximately market share of prescription volume in our target universe for the week ending february   which is two years from our launch of elestat in the united states 
in regards to the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  elestat represents approximately of total prescriptions through the week ending december  by comparison  in  elestat had approximately of total allergic conjunctivitis prescriptions through the week ending december  allergan has secured coverage on formularies of certain commercial and government plans since the launch of elestat 
this coverage allows us to continue to increase prescription market share  but may require price concessions which would ultimately impact the level of co promotion revenue that we receive from net sales of elestat 
while the market share for elestat  in terms of prescriptions  has continued to increase  our revenues were impacted by higher than expected rebates associated with additions to state medicaid programs 
in regards to co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat  we are entitled to an escalating percentage of net sales based upon predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
during a fiscal year  we recognize product co promotion revenue associated with targeted net sales levels for elestat achieved during that time period and defer revenue in excess of the sales level achieved 
we achieved the annual net sales target level in the three month period ended june   and achieved the annual net sales target level in the three month period ended september  we began co promotion activities related to restasis in january and began receiving co promotion revenue in april all of our revenue from restasis is based on worldwide net sales of restasis according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
we recognized approximately million of co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis during the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in the increase is due to increased physician and patient acceptance of restasis as well as a scheduled increase to the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we were entitled  which became effective in april allergan had net sales of restasis of million in  million in and million in our future revenue will depend on various factors including the continued commercial success of elestat and restasis  rebates  discounts and returns for both products  coverage and reimbursement under commercial or government plans  our entitled percentage of us net sales of restasis which increases each april for the next two years  seasonality of sales of elestat and duration of market exclusivity of elestat and restasis 
if allergan significantly under estimates or over estimates rebate amounts  there could be a material effect on our revenue 
in addition  our revenue will also depend on whether we enter additional collaboration agreements  achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements and whether we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates 

table of contents costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research costs  clinical trial insurance  up front license fees  milestone and royalty payments relating to research and development  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in preclinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length of the trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
the decrease in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to significantly less spending on diquafosol for dry eye disease due to our nda amendment filing on june  additionally  we spent less on our denufosol for retinal disease program due to the discontinuation of this program in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in denufosol for cystic fibrosis expenditures related to conducting six month and twelve month inhalation toxicology studies and phase clinical trials during prior to initiation of our phase program  which will begin in  as well as an increase in expenses related to our corneal wound healing phase pilot study which was initiated in but was later discontinued in the third quarter of the decrease in expenses  as compared to  related to significantly decreased spending on our denufosol for upper respiratory disorders program and our ins diagnostic program  which were partially offset by increased spending on key programs in aggressive clinical and preclinical development  including expenses associated with a phase clinical trial of diquafosol for dry eye disease  a phase clinical trial and long term toxicology studies of denufosol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and a phase clinical trial of denufosol for retinal disease 
during  we lowered the priority of the denufosol for upper respiratory disorders and the ins diagnostic programs and decreased the resources dedicated to them 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and and from the respective project s inception are shown below and includes the percentage of overall research and development expenditures for the years listed 
in thousands year ended december  cumulative from inception october  to december  denufosol tetrasodium ins respiratory for cystic fibrosis ins antiplatelet diquafosol tetrasodium ins ophthalmic for dry eye disease denufosol tetrasodium ins ophthalmic for retinal disease diquafosol tetrasodium ins ophthalmic for corneal wound healing denufosol tetrasodium ins intranasal for upper respiratory disorders ins diagnostic uridine triphosphate other discovery and development costs total 
table of contents in september  kirin terminated its license for this drug candidate 
other discovery and development costs represent all unallocated research and development costs or those costs allocated to preclinical programs  discontinued and or inactive programs 
these unallocated costs include personnel costs of our discovery programs  internal and external general research costs and other internal and external costs of other drug discovery and development programs 
as of december   these programs were not in active development 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude or scope of our clinical  preclinical and discovery activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
in addition  our future research and development expenses will now have a component of stock based compensation for unvested options as of january   and thus will increase as this expense has not been included in the past 
accordingly  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to resulted from a full year of active promotion of elestat and restasis and expanded commercial activity as we continue to build the elestat brand 
following the launch of elestat and the start of co promotion activities for both the elestat and restasis brands  we continue to adjust the timing and targeting of our advertising  promotional  phase clinical trials and other commercial activities for elestat and restasis based on seasonal trends and other factors 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to  resulted from inspire beginning commercial operations in the first quarter of  including increases in personnel  advertising and promotion expenses and other administrative costs to enable our active co promotion of elestat and restasis 
our commercial organization focuses its promotional efforts on approximately  highly prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists and allergists in our target universe 
our selling and marketing expenses include all direct costs associated with the commercial organization  which include our sales force and marketing programs 
our sales force expenses include salaries  training and educational program costs  product sample costs  fleet management and travel 
our marketing and promotion expenses include product management  promotion  advertising  public relations  phase clinical trial costs  physician training and continuing medical education and administrative expenses 
future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that may immediately precede and follow product launches 
in addition  our future selling and marketing expenses will now have a component of stock based compensation for unvested options as of january   and thus will increase as this expense has not been included in the past 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality compliance  facilities and information systems 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  as compared to  was primarily due to increased salary and personnel related expenses  increased legal and administrative expenses associated with our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and overall corporate growth 
the increase in general and 
table of contents administrative expenses was primarily due to expenses necessary to support and maintain a commercial organization  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  as well as overall corporate growth 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level of our future research and development and commercialization activities  as well as the level of legal and administrative expenses incurred to resolve our stockholder litigation and sec investigation 
in addition  our future general and administrative expenses will now have a component of stock based compensation for unvested options as of january   and thus will increase as this expense has not been included in the past 
we expect our future professional fees to continue to increase as a result of our stockholder litigation and sec investigation see litigation and sec investigation described elsewhere in this report 
other income expense other income  net totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for and  for other income fluctuates from year to year based upon fluctuations in the interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances and realized gains and losses on investments offset by interest expense on debt obligations 
the increase in other income  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from larger average cash and investment balances during as a result of stock offerings in the second half of and of higher yielding investments overall 
this increase was partially offset by write down of available for sale investments of approximately  due to an impairment deemed other than temporary 
the increase in other income  as compared to  was primarily the result of a write down of a strategic investment in and larger average cash and investment balances as a result of stock offerings that generated net proceeds in excess of million in the second half of future other income will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return and change in fair market value on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock 
we currently receive revenue from co promotion of elestat and restasis  but do not expect this revenue to exceed our operating expenses 
at december   we had net working capital of million  a decrease of approximately million from million at december  the decrease in working capital is principally due to the use of funds for our normal operating expenses  which exceeded the co promotion revenue we recognized 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments which are considered available for sale  reflecting a million decrease of cash  cash equivalents and investment balances from december  our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our drug development programs  the costs related to the potential fda approval of diquafosol and our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the level of required administrative and legal support  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  the commercial potential of our products and product candidates  outcome of our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and any expansion of facility space 
in fiscal year  we expect approximately million of revenue and are targeting operating expenses of million 
using the mid point of our revenue and expense guidance  we expect an average cash burn rate of approximately million per month in our expense range includes the expected impact 
table of contents of non cash stock option expense as required under sfas no 
r 
we intend to continue to offer stock options to attract and retain qualified employees and directors and we will be required to expense this non cash cost beginning in the first quarter of based upon stock options currently outstanding as well as those we expect to issue in  and utilizing the valuation model and assumptions consistent with our quarterly calculations  we project non cash stock option expense to be approximately million for fiscal year we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements through in order for us to continue operations after that point  we will need to obtain product candidate approvals  in license commercial products  out license rights to our product candidates  and or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources 
we have the ability to sell approximately million worth of common stock under an effective shelf registration statement  which we filed with the securities and exchange commission on april  however  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all 
our ability to achieve our operating expense target range is subject to several risks including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand the magnitude or scope of existing development programs  the need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  commercial success of our products and product candidates  unanticipated professional fees or settlements associated with our stockholder litigation or sec investigation and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
contractual commitments as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and or drug product as well as with others 
the amount of our financial commitments under these arrangements totaled approximately million at december  in addition  we have other contractual commitments outside of drug development under arrangements which totaled approximately  at december  these amounts may vary dependent upon the results of underlying studies  the completion of studies and or projects and certain other variable components that may yield a result that differs from management s estimate 
also  at december   we have future contractual commitments to pay million of lease obligations for our administrative offices  fleet vehicles  laboratory facilities and equipment 
we have also engaged legal counsel to represent us in our sec investigation and stockholder litigation  but we are not contractually obligated to incur future costs under the applicable engagement letters 
however  we do anticipate future costs to be incurred to retain counsel until these proceedings are resolved 
because of the nature of the situation  we are unable to estimate any future commitment in regards to these legal proceedings and have not included any committed costs in our projected contractual commitment disclosures 
the terms of our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require that we make future cash payments 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones and up to an additional million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our discovery and drug development programs  ongoing costs and outcome of our sec investigation and stockholder litigation  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
in addition  there is approximately  of development milestones under existing license agreements related to currently inactive development programs and we believe it is unlikely the milestones will be achieved and payments made 
we are also obligated to pay royalties on net sales  if any  of certain product candidates currently in our portfolio 
some of our existing license agreements require minimum annual license preservation fees of up to  in addition  if we obtain licenses on additional product candidates in the future  or if our collaborative arrangements identify additional product candidates  our license obligations would increase 
subject to the information and qualifications included in the above paragraph  the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that 
table of contents we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that the contracts may be terminated 
some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table in thousands payment due by period as of december  contractual and potential obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual payments development milestone obligations sales milestone obligations total includes estimated payments for cancelable portion of fleet vehicles under a master lease agreement

litigation on february   a purported class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina by mirco investors  llc on behalf of itself and all other similarly situated purchasers against us and certain of our senior officers 
the complaint alleges violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and securities and exchange commission rule b  and focuses on statements that are claimed to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  diquafosol 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from june  through february  four additional proposed stockholder class actions were filed in the same court  making substantially the same allegations against the same parties as defendants and seeking certification of the same class of purchasers 
these individual lawsuits have now been consolidated into a single civil action and a lead plaintiff appointed 
we anticipate that an amended consolidated complaint may be filed in march we intend to defend the litigation vigorously 
as with any legal proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these pending lawsuits  nor can a reasonable estimate of the amounts of loss  if any  be made 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
in the event of an adverse outcome  our business  future results of operations  financial position and or cash flows could be materially affected 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
sec investigation on august   the securities and exchange commission notified us that it is conducting a formal  nonpublic investigation  which we believe relates to trading in our securities surrounding the february  announcement of the results of a phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  diquafosol  as well as our disclosures regarding this phase clinical trial 
we are continuing to cooperate with the securities and exchange commission s ongoing investigation 
we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of this investigation  nor can a reasonable estimate of the costs that might result from the sec s investigation be made 

table of contents in the event of an adverse outcome  our business  future results of operations  financial position and or cash flows could be materially affected 
responding to this investigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees

r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption for all amounts previously presented in pro forma disclosures under sfas no 

table of contents we will adopt sfas no 
r on january   as required  and will be incorporating the modified prospective method for future periods 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations and our overall financial position 
in december  our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options held by directors and employees  including officers  which had an exercise price equal to or greater than 
the decision to accelerate these options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would be expected to be recorded in future periods following our adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  the board of directors determined that because these options had exercise prices well in excess of the current market value  they were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention 
as a result of the acceleration  we have reduced future compensation expense  before any applicable tax  by approximately million  which expense would have been recorded over the next years 
we estimate that the non cash stock option expense for fiscal year  based upon the current number of unvested stock options outstanding as of december   as well as those we expect to issue in  and utilizing the valuation model and assumptions consistent with our quarterly filings  is approximately million 
however  actual stock based compensation expense for may be different depending on the assumptions  methodologies and number of unvested stock options used in the actual calculation under sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of united states government and government agency obligations  money market and mutual fund investments  municipal and corporate notes and bonds and asset or mortgage backed securities 
our portfolio has a current average maturity of less than months  using the stated maturity or reset maturity dates associated with individual maturities as the basis for the calculation 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  changes in the market value of investments due to changes in interest rates  the increase or decrease in realized gains and losses on investments and the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to capital leases and other short term debt obligations 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in addition  we have  of our long term investments that are held in a restricted account that collateralizes a letter of credit with a financial institution 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates 
strategic investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we have a strategic investment in parion sciences  inc valued at  as of december  this investment represents unregistered preferred stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the investment
