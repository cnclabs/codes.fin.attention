overview and management focus our strategy and management focus is based upon the following long term objectives captive growth  providing a competitive and attractive alternative to the operations of our global customers expansion of our bearing product offering and closely related adjacent markets  and global expansion of our manufacturing base to better address the global requirements of our customers management generally focuses on these trends and relevant market indicators global industrial growth and economics global automotive production rates costs subject to the global inflationary environment  including  but not limited to o raw material o wages and benefits  including health care costs o regulatory compliance o energy raw material availability trends related to the geographic migration of competitive manufacturing regulatory environment for united states public companies currency and exchange rate movements and trends interest rate levels and expectations management generally focuses on the following key indicators of operating performance sales growth cost of products sold levels selling  general and administrative expense levels net income cash flow from operations and capital spending customer service reliability external and internal quality indicators employee development since our formation in  we have grown primarily through the acquisition of in house ball manufacturing operations of domestic and international bearing manufacturers resulting in increased sales of high precision balls for bearing applications 
management believes that our core business sales growth since our formation has been due to our ability to capitalize on opportunities in global markets and provide precision products at competitive prices  as well as our emphasis on product quality and customer service 
in  we recognized changing dynamics in the marketplace  and as a result  began implementing an extensive long term growth strategy building upon our core business and leveraging our inherent strengths to better serve our global customer base 
as part of this strategy  we sought to augment our intrinsic growth with complementary acquisitions that fit specific criteria 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of earsley capital corporation  formerly known as industrial molding corporation imc for consideration of approximately million

acquisition financing of approximately million euro approximately million was drawn at closing  and the credit facility provided for additional working capital expenditure financing 
in connection with this transaction  total equity  specifically additional paid in capital  increased by million euros million to reflect the increase in our proportionate interest in nn europe as related to our 
we have always consolidated nn europe due to our majority ownership and have accounted for the acquisitions of the pinerolo  italy and eltmann  germany ball factories in a manner similar to the purchase method of accounting 
on december  we completed the purchase of the interest held by ina

delta provides high quality engineered bearing seals and other precision molded rubber products to original equipment manufacturers 
delta operates two manufacturing facilities in danielson  connecticut 
on september   we announced the closing of our walterboro  south carolina ball manufacturing facility effective december the closing was made as part of our strategy to redistribute our global production in order to better utilize capacity and serve the needs of our worldwide customers 
the precision ball production of the walterboro facility has been fully absorbed by our remaining us ball roller manufacturing facilities located in erwin and mountain city  tennessee 
in and we recorded before tax charges associated with the closing of million and million  respectively 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording of impairment on our manufacturing facility located in walterboro  south carolina and million related to employee severance costs 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording of an additional impairment on the facility  a million before tax charge for the recording of impairment on the machinery and equipment and a million charge related to employee severance costs 
there were no impairment charges related to these assets recorded in the land and building assets were sold during the fourth quarter of as a result  we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of approximately million which has been recorded as a loss on disposal of assets  a component of income from operations 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to certain remaining machinery and equipment assets of this facility 
this amount was recorded as a component of restructuring and impairment costs 
the financial results of this operation have been reflected in the domestic ball and roller segment in the years ended december  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective december   we sold our minority interest in jiangsu general ball roller company  ltd  a chinese ball and roller manufacturer located in rugao city  jiangsu province  china

we paid consideration of approximately million euros million and incurred other costs of approximately million  for the veenendaal net assets acquired from skf 
the veenendaal operation manufactures rollers for tapered roller bearings and metal cages for both tapered roller and spherical roller bearings allowing us to expand our bearing component offering 
the financial results of the veenendaal operation are included in the nn europe segment 
on october   we acquired certain assets comprised of land  building and machinery and equipment of the precision ball operations of klf gulickaren klf  based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia 
we paid consideration of approximately million euros million 
the assets are being utilized by our wholly owned subsidiary nn slovakia based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia  which began production in the financial results of the operations are included in our nn europe segment 
during we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  nn precision bearing products company  ltd 
this subsidiary began production of precision balls during the fourth quarter of  and is located in the kunshan economic and technology development zone  jiangsu  the people s republic of china and is a component of our strategy to globally expand our manufacturing base 
on october  we entered into an agreement with snr roulements snr to purchase all of snr s internal precision ball producing equipment for approximately million euros million 
snr  a division of renault sa  france  is a global bearing manufacturer and supplier to the automotive  industrial and aerospace industries 
as part of the transaction  we received a three year supply agreement for the present business approximately million and a five year supply agreement to provide snr with its annual ball requirements of the former in house production of approximately million 
the product will be supplied from nn europe s existing precision ball operations 
in december  we started to acquire the precision ball producing equipment of snr  from its manufacturing facility in annecy  france 
once complete  we will have acquired approximately million euros approximately million of equipment and intangibles 
the implementation and successful execution of this acquisition strategy to date has allowed the company to expand its global presence and positions the company for continued global growth and expansion into core served markets 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgment underlying them  are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and post retirement benefits 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not significantly differ from the estimates used in these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues based on the stated shipping terms with the customer and the company recognizes revenue when these terms are satisfied and the risks of ownership are transferred to the customer 
the company has an inventory management program for certain major ball and roller customers whereby revenue is recognized when products are used by the customer from consigned stock  rather than at the time of shipment 
under both circumstances  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sellers price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded upon recognition of a sale of goods and ownership and risk of loss is assumed by the customer 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable is due primarily from the core served markets bearing manufacturers  automotive industry  electronics  industrial  agricultural and aerospace 
the company experienced million of bad debt expense during  during and million during in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  the company performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs when available including the customers financial position  past payment history  relevant industry trends  cash flows  management capability  historical loss experience and economic conditions and prospects 
accounts receivable are written off or reserves established when considered to be uncollectible or at risk of being uncollectible 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventories are not generally subject to obsolescence due to spoilage or expiring product life cycles 
the company assesses inventory obsolescence routinely and records a reserve when inventory items are deemed non recoverable in future periods 
the company operates generally as a make to order business  however  the company also stocks products for certain customers in order to meet delivery schedules 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  the company could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
acquisitions and acquired intangibles 
for new acquisitions  the company uses estimates  assumptions and appraisals to allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and to determine the amount of goodwill 
these estimates are based on market analyses and comparisons to similar assets 
annual tests are required to be performed to assess whether recorded goodwill is impaired 
the annual tests require management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the future operations of its reporting units  and the expected cash flows that they will generate 
these estimates and assumptions therefore impact the recorded value of assets acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  and whether or not there is any subsequent impairment of the recorded goodwill and the amount of such impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment 
the recoverability of the long term assets is dependent on the performance of the companies which the company has acquired  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these acquisitions 
in assessing potential impairment for these assets the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance 
for assets held for sale  appraisals are relied upon to assess the fair market value of those assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse operating results of the underlying assets could result in the company having to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
pension obligations 
the company uses several assumptions in determining its periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations which are included in the consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include determining an appropriate discount rate  rate of compensation increase as well as the remaining service period of active employees 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data and the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each income statement line item presented 
as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of product sold exclusive of depreciation shown separately below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization gain loss on disposal of assets restructuring and impairment costs income from operations interest expense other income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary net income off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease commitments for machinery  office equipment  vehicles  manufacturing and office space which expire on varying dates 
the following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments as of december  under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year in thousands

none of our other customers individually accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales for the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our operating profit margin and cash flows from operations 
the schaeffler group ina and skf agreements for precision steel balls expire on june  and july   respectively 
schaeffler group ina has decided to in source approximately million of annual business to their internal ball manufacturing facility in germany 
this represents approximately of the existing schaeffler group ina business 
we are in the process of negotiating a long term supply agreement with schaeffler group ina for remaining business 
in addition  we are in process of negotiating a new long term agreement with skf to replace the one for precision balls that expires july  skf has informally agreed in principle to carry the current agreement through to december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results by segment in thousands domestic ball and roller segment nn europe segment plastic and rubber components segment nn  inc change change change change net sales cost of products sold selling  general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization restructuring and impairment gain loss on sale of fixed assets interest other income loss pre tax income taxes net income net sales

as a percentage of net sales  cost of products sold increased from in to in the price of steel has risen over the last twelve to eighteen months with the potential for prices to reflect even greater increases 
the increase is principally due to general increases in global demand and  more recently  due to china s increased consumption of steel 
this has had the impact of increasing scrap surcharges we pay in procuring our steel in the form of higher unit prices and scrap surcharges and could adversely impact the availability of steel 
our contracts with key customers allow us to pass a majority of the steel price increases on to those customers 
however  by contract  material price changes in any given year are typically passed along with price adjustments in january of the following year

accordingly  no dividends have been declared or paid by nn europe that may have been used by the company to permanently pay down our domestic credit facilities 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers of our domestic business other than foreign customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within or days following the date of shipment 
under the domestic ball and roller segments inventory management program with certain european customers  payments typically are due within days after the customer uses the product 
the company s arrangement with its nn europe segment customers regarding due dates vary from to days following date of sale with an average of approximately days outstanding 
the company s sales and receivables can be influenced by seasonality due to the company s relative percentage of european business coupled with many foreign customers ceasing production during the month of august

as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange transaction and translation risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are available to management including producing and selling in local currencies and hedging programs 
as of december   no currency hedges were in place 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar and or euro against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the company to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales 
working capital  which consists principally of accounts receivable and inventories offset by accounts payable  was million at december  as compared to million at december  the movement in working capital is due to the decrease in accounts receivable of million  offset by increases in inventory of million  decrease in accounts payable of million  the decrease in the eltmann restructuring of million  and the reclassification of a million note receivable from non current assets to current assets 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from at december  to at december  cash flow from operations totaled million in  compared with million in and million in higher net income and accounts receivable collections were offset by an increase in inventory during during  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
of this amount  million will be related primarily to equipment and process upgrades and replacements  approximately million will be principally related to geographic expansion of our manufacturing base  and million will be related to the completion of the snr transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions  purchase of minority interest and new businesses 
we intend to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs  projected capital expenditure requirements  and dividend payments through december subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan

ltd for the lease of land and building approximately  square feet in the kunshan economic and technology development zone  jiangsu  the people s republic of china 
the lease is cancelable by the company in the fifth  ninth  and fourteenth year 
the building was newly constructed and we began usage of the leased property during the fourth quarter of the agreement satisfied the requirements of a capital lease at june  and we recorded the lease as a capital lease in our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of the capital leases line in the table above reflects the undiscounted future minimum lease payments given that the lease was recorded as of october   the date the company began to use the property 
no other amounts are included in capital leases above 
other long term obligations consist of steel purchase commitments at the nn europe segment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the euro the company currently has operations in ireland  germany  italy and the netherlands  all of which are euro participating countries  and in slovakia which joined the european union in may and is expected to adopt the euro as its functional currency within several years 
each of the company s european facilities sell product to customers in many of the euro participating countries 
the euro has been adopted as the functional currency at all locations in the nn europe segment  except slovakia whose functional currency is the slovak koruna 
seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results the company s net sales historically have been seasonal in nature  due to a significant portion of the company s sales being to european customers that cease or significantly slow production during the month of august 
for information concerning the company s quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel  engineered resins and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to material change 
for the domestic ball and roller and nn europe segments  the average price of steel increased approximately and in  respectively 
for both segments  the price of steel increased by in  and increased approximately in in our plastic and rubber components segment we experienced price increases for engineered resins of approximately in  in  and price decreases of approximately in and increases for proprietary rubber compounds and metal stampings of approximately in  in  and price decreases of in our typical pricing arrangements with steel suppliers are subject to adjustment every six months 
the company s nn europe segment long term agreement with its primary steel supplier expired at the end of a new yearly agreement has been entered into by nn europe with the same terms and conditions and is based on a yearly base price and quarterly scrap surcharge adjustments 
the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
in the past  the company has been able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price fluctuations by taking such measures

deduction for qualified domestic production activities and repatriation of earnings in october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
based on an analysis of production cost  we believe the impact from the phase out of the eti will be principally offset by the phase in of the act 
thus  based on production levels the act will not have a material impact in the tax expense or net income of the company

the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
at this time  the company does not expect to repatriate earnings under the provisions of the act
