item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of january   we operated approximately  home video retail stores that rent and sell movies and video games in urban  rural and suburban markets 
we operate three distinct brands movie gallery  hollywood video and game crazy 
on april   we completed our acquisition of hollywood entertainment corporation  or hollywood 
our acquisition of hollywood was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
accordingly  our results of operations for include the operating results of hollywood only since the date of the acquisition and are not indicative of annualized results of the combined companies 
this acquisition increased our total revenues to over billion on a pro forma annual basis with a store count of over  stores and substantially increased our urban market presence 
we currently plan to maintain the hollywood brand and store format 
we currently plan to open approximately new stores for the full year period  subject to market and industry conditions and the integration of hollywood 
movie gallery s eastern focused rural and secondary market dominance and hollywood s western focused prime urban and suburban superstore locations combine to form a strong nationwide geographical store footprint 
we believe the most significant dynamic in our industry is the relationship our industry maintains with the movie studios 
the studios have historically maintained an exclusive window for home video distribution dvds and video cassettes available for rental and sale  which provides the home video industry with an approximately day period during which they can rent and sell new releases before they are made available on pay per view or other distribution channels 
according to kagan research  the domestic home video industry accounts for approximately of domestic studio movie revenue in for this reason  we believe movie studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable home video business 
our strategies have been designed to achieve reasonable  moderate and consistent growth in same store revenues and profitability in a mature industry 
we strive to minimize the operating and overhead costs associated with our business 
we intend to apply these same disciplines to the hollywood brand where appropriate 
in addition to the relationship between our industry and the movie studios  our operating results are driven by revenue  inventory  rent and payroll 
given those key factors  we believe that by monitoring the five operating performance indicators described below  we can continue to be successful in executing our operating plans and our strategy 
revenues 
our business is a cash business with initial rental fees paid upfront by the customer 
our management teams continuously review inventory levels  marketing and sales promotions  real estate strategies  and staffing requirements in order to maximize profitable revenues at each location 
additionally  our teams monitor revenue performance on a daily basis to quickly identify trends or issues in our store base or in the industry as a whole 
our management closely monitors same store revenues  which we define as revenues at stores that we have operated for at least twelve full months  to assess the performance of our business 
product purchasing economics 
in order to maintain the desired profit margin in our business  purchases of inventory for both rental and sale must be carefully managed 
our purchasing models are designed to analyze the impact of the economic factors inherent in the various pricing strategies employed by the studios 
we believe that we are able to achieve purchasing levels tailored for the customer demographics of each of our markets and to maximize the return on investment of our inventory purchase dollars 
store level cost control 
the most significant store expenses are payroll and rent  followed by other supply and service expenditures 
we attempt to control these expenses primarily through budgeting systems and centralization of purchases into our corporate support centers 
this enables us to measure performance against expectations and to leverage our purchasing power 
we also benefit from the reduced labor and real estate costs the movie gallery brand stores enjoy by being located in rural markets versus the higher costs associated with the larger urban markets 
we are also able to adjust store hours and staffing levels to specific market conditions as well as leverage best practices from both movie gallery and hollywood to reduce expense and increase operating efficiency 
leverage of overhead expenses 
we apply the same principles of budgeting  accountability and conservatism in our overhead spending that we employ in managing our store operating costs 
our general and administrative expenses include the costs to maintain our corporate support centers as well as the overhead costs of our field management teams 
our integration strategy is focused on eliminating duplication  leveraging best practices and reaping the financial benefits of economies of scale to reduce costs 
operating cash flows 
we have generated significant levels of cash flow for several years 
we have historically been able to fund the majority of our store growth and acquisitions  as well as ongoing inventory purchases  from cash flow generated from operations 
an exception to this was the acquisition of hollywood  which we funded through a combination of cash on hand and significant long term debt 
hollywood acquisition on april   we completed our cash acquisition of hollywood  refinanced substantially all of the existing indebtedness of hollywood  and replaced our existing unsecured revolving credit facility 
we paid million to purchase all of hollywood s outstanding common stock and million to refinance hollywood s debt 
as part of the refinancing of hollywood s debt  hollywood executed a tender offer for its million principal amount senior subordinated notes due  pursuant to which million were tendered 
the hollywood acquisition was financed using hollywood s cash on hand of approximately million  and a senior secured credit facility guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount of million  and an issuance of million of senior unsecured notes 
the combination of movie gallery and hollywood created the second largest north american video rental company with pro forma combined annual revenue in excess of billion and approximately  stores located in all us states  canada and mexico 
the acquisition substantially increased our presence on the west coast and in urban areas 
hollywood s predominantly west coast urban superstore locations present little overlap with movie gallery s rural and suburban store locations concentrated in the eastern half of the united states 
in the fourth quarter of  we closed movie gallery stores with trade areas that overlapped with acquired hollywood video stores 
we will continue to evaluate the closure of stores with overlapping trade areas such as these as market conditions warrant 
we will maintain the hollywood store format and brand separately from our movie gallery business because of hollywood s distinct operational model and to ensure customer continuity 
there has been a conscious effort not to interrupt the field management organizations at movie gallery and hollywood to ensure they remain focused on revenue and customer service 
integration efforts to date have primarily focused on consolidating the leadership functions in all three brands 
this is complete for the human resources  real estate  legal  lease administration  finance  information systems  loss prevention and distribution functions 
the respective leaders of these support organizations continue to evaluate opportunities to leverage both movie gallery s and hollywood s best practices and generate general and administrative cost savings 
to date  we have identified cost savings opportunities in both movie gallery s and hollywood s cost structures and we anticipate that we will identify additional opportunities in the future 
the combined companies also are evaluating opportunities to reap the benefits of increased purchasing leverage to reduce costs 
however  we can make no assurances that we will successfully integrate hollywood s business with our business or that we will achieve any further cost savings 
as of october   we notified movie gallery associates that their positions will be relocated or eliminated as part of our integration plan through the consolidation of finance  accounting  treasury  product  logistics  human resources and payroll at our wilsonville  oregon support center 
subsequently  as of january   an additional movie gallery associates were notified that their positions were being eliminated 
as this action impacts the acquiring company s associates  these costs are charged to the condensed consolidated statement of operations as they are incurred 
the affected individuals are required to render service for a range of to weeks in order to receive termination benefits 
we estimate that the total cost of providing severance  retention incentives and outplacement services to these associates will be approximately million  of which million was recognized in  with the remainder to be expensed over the remaining retention service period for the impacted associates in in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with disposal and exit activities 
we estimate the integration related efficiencies and savings achieved during to be in excess of million 
these savings have been driven principally by improvements in the supply chain for movie gallery branded stores  consolidation of our real estate and architecture functions  inventory utilization  and elimination of duplicative executive management 
we continue to identify and implement additional savings opportunities 
we expect that total savings  including new projects in combined with the full year impact of the savings already achieved in will be in excess of million 
other acquisitions during the second quarter of  we acquired vhq entertainment  inc  or vhq 
vhq operated stores in canada 
vhq s results of operations have been included in our results since may  in addition to the vhq acquisition  during  movie gallery purchased stores in separate transactions for a total cash consideration  including vhq  of million 
these acquisitions had an immaterial impact on our operating results in by letter dated august   boards video company llc  or boards  an entity controlled by mark wattles  the founder and former chief executive officer of hollywood  exercised a contractual right to require hollywood to purchase all of the hollywood video stores and game crazy stores owned and operated by boards pursuant to a put option contained in the license agreement for these stores 
the put option  and a related call option  were contained in the license agreement between hollywood and boards which was effective january  on a change of control as defined in the license agreement hollywood had an option to purchase the stores within six months 
likewise  on a change of control  boards had the option to require hollywood to purchase the stores within six months 
in both cases  the process by which the price would be determined was detailed in the license agreement and was at fair value as determined by an appraisal process 
we concluded that the put call option features of the license agreement were not a derivative or embedded derivative under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  because the put and call features were not net settleable  as there was no provision for net cash settlement  there was no market for the option features  and the underlying asset the stores were not readily convertible to cash 
in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  hollywood and boards have agreed to the retention of a valuation expert and are proceeding with the valuation of the stores 
it is anticipated that the transaction will close in the following discussion of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is intended to provide further insight into our performance over the last three years

hollywood same store revenues are presented for the full year periods and are inclusive of the game crazy operating segment 
hollywood same store revenues exclude the effects of the accounting change for extended viewing fees recognition described in note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
includes  hollywood video stores and free standing game crazy stores acquired in the acquisition of hollywood in april and stores acquired in our acquisition of vhq in may see note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
consolidated total revenues increased and for and  respectively  compared to the years and the increase in revenues for was primarily due to the acquisition of hollywood  which added billion in revenue 
same store total revenues for fiscal were negative 
same store rental revenue  including sales of previously viewed rental inventory  declined while same store product revenue increased 
the increase in revenue compared to was primarily due to a increase in the average number of stores operated during the year partially offset by a same store revenue decrease of 
with the acquisition of hollywood  our revenue mix has shifted more to product revenue and away from rental revenue versus comparative periods last year 
the game crazy operating segment is the primary driver of this shift in the revenue mix 
we believe this trend will continue for two to three years due to the introduction of new game platforms 
for and  the movie gallery operating segment total revenues increased and  respectively  from the prior years 
the increases were primarily due to increases of approximately and in the average number of stores operated  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by same store revenue decreases of and for and  respectively 
same store rental revenue declined for  while same store product sales increased 
the addition of the hollywood operating segment revenue for accounted for of the total revenue increase 
the hollywood segment total same store revenues decreased for all same store revenue statistics for hollywood include periods prior to our acquisition 
same store rental revenue declined  while same store product revenue increased 
to conform hollywood s extended viewing fees accounting policy to movie gallery s accounting policy  we have reflected the portion of extended viewing fees collected that relate to receivables from customers at the date of our merger as a reduction of the receivable balance  and extended viewing fees are no longer being recognized in advance of collection 
as a result of conforming this accounting policy following the merger  hollywood s extended viewing fees recognized as revenue in was million less than the actual amounts collected from customers 
the same store total revenue and same store rental revenue statistics for hollywood have been presented excluding the impact of conforming hollywood s historical accounting method to movie gallery s method 
the following factors contributed to a decrease in our total same store revenues for versus movie rental revenue  including previously viewed sales  declined and was adversely impacted by the weak home video release schedule  the overabundance of dvd titles available for sale in the marketplace  the growth of on line rental and the maturation of the dvd life cycle 
game rental revenue declined reflecting the weakness of new game titles released during the year and the industry softness that traditionally occurs before the introduction of new game platforms 
microsoft s xbox was released late in and new platforms from sony and nintendo are anticipated in cost of sales 
the cost of rental revenues includes the amortization of rental inventory  revenue sharing expenses incurred and the cost of previously viewed rental inventory sold 
the gross margin on rental revenue for  and was  and  respectively 
a charge of million was recorded against cost of rental revenues in the second quarter of fiscal to reflect a change in estimate of the residual value of vhs movies from to 
excluding the extended viewing fees adjustment for hollywood and the vhs residual value adjustment in the second quarter for movie gallery  gross margin on rental revenue would have been for we have presented gross margins on rental revenue adjusted to exclude charges related to the extended viewing fee and vhs residual value adjustments because we believe it provides our investors a more informed view of the current period operating results and our management uses this information to analyze our results from continuing operations and to view trends and changes in these results 
we also changed our estimate of the percentage of total rental inventory purchases allocated to catalog or base stock inventory in the fourth quarter for our movie gallery segment to reflect recent trends in retention patterns of catalog inventory  which resulted in a charge of million in rental amortization per share net of tax 
in addition to the negative impact on rental gross margin caused by the accounting adjustments noted above  rental gross margins also decreased as a result of the acquisition of the hollywood video stores  as their gross margins have historically been lower than those of movie gallery stores  because hollywood generally invests more in rental inventory as a percentage of revenue to compete effectively in urban markets 
higher than expected same store revenue declines for movie rental revenue and higher than historical discount and promotional activity related to previously viewed products also contributed to the reduced rental gross margins 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new and used video game merchandise in the game crazy operating segment  new movies  concessions and other products sold in our hollywood and movie gallery stores 
new movies and new game merchandise typically have a much lower margin than previously viewed movies  used game merchandise and concessions 
the gross margin on product sales is subject to fluctuations in the relative mix of the products that are sold 
the gross margin on product sales for  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in product sales margin in compared to was primarily caused by higher penetration of new movies and new game merchandise sales 
we expect that the acquisition of the game crazy operating segment acquired with hollywood will continue to increase the percentage of total revenues from new game merchandise sales versus comparable prior year periods 
we expect this trend to continue for two to three years due to the introduction of new game platforms 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses include store level expenses such as lease payments  in store payroll and start up costs associated with new store openings 
store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to is primarily due to a decrease in same store revenues for the combined company in versus a decrease of in  as certain operating expenses are fixed and increase as a percentage of revenue when revenues decline 
the decrease in same store revenues in was more significant than anticipated thereby limiting our ability to reduce variable expenses in response to the revenue decrease 
our decision to close movie gallery stores that overlapped trade areas with hollywood stores required the establishment of a store closure reserve for the remaining lease obligations and the write off of remaining property  fixtures and equipment of million a significant number of new store openings generating store opening and start up costs for immature stores in the revenue base our store base has increased by or more in each of  and 
new stores typically do not perform as well as mature stores in their first year of operations  because a substantial portion of store operating expenses are fixed 
the increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in from to is primarily due to an increase to depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of million of which million relates to prior years related to the correction of errors in our historical amortization practice for leasehold improvements  the decrease in same store revenues in  as certain operating expenses are fixed and result in an increase as a percentage of revenue when revenues decline  and continued growth in the number of new store openings generating store opening and start up costs for a larger number of immature stores in the revenue base versus the prior year our store base has increased by or more in each of  and 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from fiscal to is due to the acquisition of hollywood and its lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue reduced our percentage of revenue despite increases in severance for integration and the impact of higher than anticipated same store revenue decreases 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is due to the same store revenue decrease of in fiscal  and overhead increases to support our expanding store base and growth strategy  which included continued expansion in geographic areas where our market penetration was lower 
impairment losses 
impairment charges include the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and customer lists 
the first quarter results for both hollywood and movie gallery were significantly better than management s expectations and plans 
our results after the integration in the second and third quarters were worse than management s expectations  but were believed to be primarily driven by a weak title line up in the second and third quarters 
management expected a recovery in the fourth quarter primarily from improving title content 
this recovery did not materialize 
because the fourth quarter results failed to meet our expectations  we revised our outlook for and beyond and reflected these updated forecasts in our determination and measurement of the fourth quarter impairment charges 
following is a description of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of goodwill goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
additionally  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value 
we tested goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of in accordance with our normal accounting policy and pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill is tested at a reporting unit level 
our reporting units for this purpose are movie gallery  hollywood video and game crazy 
goodwill is impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its assets 
the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was computed using the present value of estimated future cash flows  which included the impact of trends in the business and industry noted in  including the accelerated decline in the in store rental industry  increased competition in the video sell through markets and the growth of the on line movie rental segment in which neither movie gallery nor hollywood has a presence 
impairments of goodwill were recorded for the movie gallery and hollywood reporting units in the amounts of million and million respectively 
intangible assets as a result of the impairment indicators that contributed to the goodwill impairment charges described in the preceding paragraph  we also tested all other intangible assets for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of based on the results of this test  we concluded that customer list intangible assets of our movie gallery operating segment were impaired 
based on the estimated value of the acquired customer lists  which were based primarily on observations of market comparables for similar customer lists on a per thousand customer basis  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of movie gallery s previously acquired customer lists to our estimate of their fair value 
we also tested the indefinite lived hollywood trademark for impairment and determined that it was not impaired 
likewise  we determined that the finite lived carrying value of the game crazy trademark was not impaired 
no other long lived assets  including rental inventory and property  fixtures and equipment  were impaired under the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense primarily represents non cash charges associated with non vested stock grants 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 compensation expense  representing the intrinsic value of the stock granted on the grant date  is recognized over the vesting period for service based awards 
compensation expense for performance based stock grants is recognized based on the amounts we believe are probable of achievement and is periodically adjusted remeasured based on the current stock price  which is consistent with accounting for variable stock based compensation 
in  we recognized million in compensation expenses related to service based stock grants and million in expenses related to performance based stock grants 
fiscal and also included nominal amounts of non cash expense associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and accounted for as variable stock options 
the majority of stock compensation expense in related to the remaining options outstanding that were repriced in in addition in  stock compensation expense also included million in cash expenses related to our decision to repurchase  shares of common stock from current and former executives  which represented the intrinsic value of those options on the date of the buy out 
see note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
beginning in fiscal  we will be required to adopt sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation 
upon adoption of sfas r  we will no longer be permitted to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value approach that we have followed under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
we may  from time to time  decide to issue stock based compensation in the form of stock grants and stock options  which under sfas no 
r will require a fair value recognition approach and will be expensed in income from continuing operations 
as a result  the amount of compensation expense we recognize over the vesting period will generally not be affected by subsequent changes in the trading value of our common stock 
operating income 
as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income loss decreased by million for fiscal to million 
the decrease in operating income was principally attributable to million in goodwill impairment charges and million for the impairment of intangibles 
there were no similar charges in excluding the one time effects of the impairment charges  operating income declined from million of revenues in to million of revenues in the following factors contributed to the remaining decline in operating income as a percentage of total revenues the hollywood segment s revenues were million lower than the actual cash collected from customers due to conforming hollywood s accounting method for extending viewing fees in  which reduced operating income by million after adjusting for accrued revenue sharing 
cost of sales has increased as a percentage of revenues due to the acquisition of hollywood and the historically lower margins generated by the hollywood video stores and game crazy departments 
the greater than anticipated decreases in same store revenues limited our ability to reduce operating costs and expenses due to the fact that many of our store level expenses are fixed 
the factors described above in revenue  cost of sales  operating costs and expenses and general and administrative expenses also contributed to an increase of operating income by in as compared to interest expense  net 
net loss for fiscal includes million pre tax  or per diluted share in interest expense  principally related to borrowings used to fund the acquisitions of hollywood and vhq 
we expect to incur significant interest expense for the foreseeable future 
immediately prior to the acquisition of hollywood  we had no debt outstanding and had carried minimal amounts of outstanding indebtedness for the preceding two fiscal years 
interest expense in and amounted to and million  respectively  a substantial portion of which related to credit facility fees and expenses 
write off of bridge financing 
concurrently with the acquisition of hollywood in the second quarter of  we wrote off million  or per diluted share net of tax  of fees and expenses associated with the bridge commitment feature of our senior credit facility 
the bridge facility was entered into in connection with the hollywood acquisition but was never drawn upon 
therefore  the associated fees were expensed concurrently with the expiration of the bridge loan commitment at the closing of the acquisition and related financing transactions 
there were no similar transactions in or equity in losses of unconsolidated entities 
during the last half of  we began to make investments in various alternative delivery vehicles both retail and digital for movie content 
we do not anticipate that any of these alternatives will replace our base video rental business 
as of january  we have completely written off our investments in these unconsolidated entities  either through recognizing our proportionate share of the investee losses under the equity method  by disposing of the related interests  or through write offs for investments we deemed to be worthless 
although we have no present intentions to do so  in the future we may make  subject to covenant limitations  similar investments that we will be required to account for as equity investments similar to the investments we have made in the past 
the write offs of our share of investee losses were lower in versus because the majority of these write offs were recorded in and only a small remaining balance was written off in income taxes 
the effective tax rate was a provision of for fiscal  compared to a provision of and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in is primarily a result of the goodwill impairment charges recognized in  a substantial portion of which was non deductible goodwill  and the establishment of a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets  a portion of which relates to net operating loss carryforwards that our management determined may not be realized through reversal of temporary differences  tax strategies and future taxable income 
as a result of the establishment of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  we expect our effective tax rate will be lower in future periods to the extent we are profitable  due to the potential reversal of the valuation allowance 
likewise  if we continue to report net losses before income taxes  we may be required to increase our valuation allowances in future periods 
therefore  we are unable to predict with certainty whether our effective tax rate in the near term will be reflective of our historical pattern 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are for seasonal working capital  debt service  new store investment  and remodeling and relocating existing stores 
we fund our capital needs primarily by cash flow from operations and  as necessary  loans under our senior secured credit facility the credit facility 
the credit facility  which we entered into in connection with the acquisition of hollywood and the refinancing of hollywood s existing indebtedness  is in an aggregate amount of million  consisting of a five year million revolving credit facility the revolver and two term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million 
term loan a is a million five year facility that matures in april  and term loan b is a million six year facility that matures on april  also in connection with the hollywood acquisition and refinancing  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due the senior notes 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in available borrowings under our credit facility 
we also had million drawn under the revolving portion of the credit facility  comprised of million and million in borrowings and letters of credit  respectively 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that cash flow available from operations and availability under the million revolver of the credit facility will be sufficient to operate our business  satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  and meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements  including debt service for the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our current plan of operations will depend upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  industry and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to fund capital resource needs  cover the ongoing costs of operating the business  remain in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility  and service our current level of indebtedness or any debt we may incur in the future 
if we are unable to satisfy these requirements with our available cash resources  we may be required to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control 
if we breach any of these covenants  one or more events of default  including cross defaults between multiple components of our indebtedness  could result 
these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owing to be immediately due and payable and to terminate any commitments to make further extensions of credit 
if we were unable to repay our debt service obligations under the credit facility or the senior notes  described below  our secured creditors could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness owed to them 
on september   we executed an amendment to the credit facility that relaxed certain financial covenants for a one year period  provided for an additional million of borrowings under the term loan b  increased the letter of credit sub limit under the revolver from million to million  and increased the percentage of excess cash flow  as defined in the credit facility  required to be applied toward principal repayment to from on march   we executed a second amendment effective through the fourth quarter that further relaxed the financial covenants and restricted our ability to fund capital expenditures  perform asset sales  and use equity proceeds 
we will incur significant fees related to this amendment including a basis point upfront fee totaling million and various professional fees 
while we were in compliance at the end of the fourth quarter with the financial covenants contained in our credit facility  we obtained the second amendment in order to remain in compliance with those covenants in the near term 
for the first quarter of  absent further amendment  the more restrictive financial covenants contained in the original credit facility will apply to us 
because the most restrictive covenants are computed on a trailing four quarter basis  we do not expect that we will be in compliance with the first quarter covenants unless the covenants are further amended or we obtain additional equity financing by that time 
we are exploring several alternative strategies to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facility  including  among other things  operational improvements through capitalizing on merger integration synergy opportunities  raising additional equity  divesting certain non core assets and sale leaseback transactions 
we also may be required to seek further amendments to our credit facility 
we cannot assure you that any of these actions will be successful  or that any sales of assets  additional debt or equity financings or further debt amendments can be obtained 
during the fourth quarter and first quarter  the term loan a and revolver bear interest rates of london interbank offered rate libor  plus  and the term loan b bears an interest rate of libor plus 
we also incur a commitment fee on the unused balance of the revolver 
the march amendment to the credit facility specifies new pricing for the interest rates on the term loans and revolver 
for the period starting april  until we deliver to the administrative agent under the credit facility our financial results for the first quarter of  the interest rate for the term loan a and revolver will be set at libor plus 
after submission of the covenant package  the pricing grid is as follows leverage ratio libor margin the term loan b pricing was revised to reflect a rate of libor plus starting april  until we deliver to the administrative agent under the credit facility our financial results for the first quarter of after then  the interest rate will be libor plus if our leverage ratio exceeds  otherwise the rate will be libor plus  as was the case during the fourth quarter and first quarter at our discretion  we can elect to defer payment of of the term loan a  term loan b and revolver interest as non cash interest  that will be added to the principal amount of the loans with compounding interest 
term loan a and term loan b require aggregate quarterly prepayments in the amounts of and  respectively  of the outstanding balances beginning september  through the first fiscal quarter of  after which the mandatory term loan b prepayments escalate 
in addition to these prepayments  the credit facility also requires us to make prepayments in an amount equal to of any excess cash flow  which generally represents the amount of cash generated by the company but not used towards operations  debt service  or investments 
the excess cash flow payment for fiscal is million due on march   which is shown separately on the contractual obligations table below as a credit facility principal repayment 
the credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by movie gallery s domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in  and liens on  substantially all of movie gallery s and its direct and indirect subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets other than leasehold mortgages on stores and first priority pledges of all the equity interests owned by movie gallery in its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interests owned by movie gallery in its existing and future wholly owned non domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility  as amended  also requires us to meet certain financial covenants including a leverage ratio test  a fixed charge coverage ratio test and an interest coverage test 
each of these covenants is calculated on trailing four quarter results based on specific definitions that are contained in the credit agreement 
in general terms  the leverage ratio is a measurement of total net indebtedness relative to operating cash flow 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is a measurement of operating cash flow plus rent less capital expenditures relative to total fixed charges including rent  scheduled principal payments  and cash interest 
the interest coverage ratio is a measurement of operating cash flow relative to cash interest expense 
the covenant levels contained in the credit facility  as amended  are as follows leverage fixed charge interest coverage ratio coverage ratio ratio q q q q q q q q the credit facility and indenture governing our senior notes impose certain restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to incur debt  grant liens  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  pay dividends  make loans and investments  sell our assets  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers or consolidations  engage in sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  and make distributions from subsidiaries 
as required by the credit facility  we have entered into a two year floating to fixed interest rate swap for an amount of million 
under the terms of the swap agreement  we pay fixed interest on the million at a rate of and receive floating interest based on three month libor 
the termination date for the swap is june  the interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is structured such that all of the terms match exactly to the hedged debt and there is no hedge ineffectiveness 
the terms of the debt and the fixed rate payments to be received on the swap coincide notional amounts  payment dates  terms and rates  and the hedge is considered perfectly effective 
we designated the swap  at inception  as a cash flow hedge and documented the hedge designation contemporaneously 
at the end of each reporting period  we assess hedge effectiveness by making sure that the terms match exactly the designated hedged debt instrument 
on each reset date after the variable rate has been determined  the ultimate payment or receipt is calculated and recorded as an increase or decrease of interest expense on a weighted average basis over the period in accordance with sfas paragraph contractual obligations

fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands statements of cash flow data net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities    the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was primarily attributable to increased sources of cash from rental amortization  accrued liabilities  and depreciation and amortization  and reduced uses of cash for merchandise inventory  other current assets  and deposits and other assets 
these improvements to cash are offset by increased uses of cash for purchases of rental inventory and accounts payable  and reduced sources of cash for deferred income taxes for fiscal versus fiscal the detail contained in the cash provided by operating activities section reflects the offsetting impact of the reduction of net income caused by the non cash impairment of goodwill and other intangibles and the source of cash generated by these non cash charges 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was primarily attributable to the revenue growth as a result of the continued expansion of our store base  offset partially in fiscal by a decline in same store revenues 
net cash used in investing activities includes the costs of business acquisitions  new store builds  and purchases of property  furnishings and equipment 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in versus was primarily due to the acquisitions of hollywood and vhq  which amounted to billion in the aggregate  versus much smaller acquisitions during during  we grew our store base through both internally developed and acquired stores 
we opened internally developed stores  acquired  stores which include the acquisitions of hollywood and vhq and closed stores during the year to date period ended january  we expect the majority of our planned new stores will be internally developed 
capital requirements to fund new store growth of stores for fiscal are estimated at million 
additionally in fiscal  we estimate million in other on going capital expenditure requirements for the existing store base 
these estimates do not include capital required to fund our acquisition of the boards stores pursuant to a contractual put provision 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal versus was primarily due to declining levels of business acquisitions  offset partially by increased new store openings and  in fiscal  by the purchase of a corporate aircraft and lighting retrofits in many of our stores to achieve savings in the cost of utilities 
net cash flow related to financing activities for fiscal includes the proceeds from the credit facility and the issuance of the senior notes 
these new financing sources contributed to the significant increase in financing cash flows as compared to  when we used cash of million to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share and paid dividends to shareholders of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in june  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share to be paid under our dividend policy instituted in december in september we announced that due to the challenging conditions currently affecting the home video industry we would not declare a quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of our board of directors later decided to suspend the payment of cash dividends indefinitely 
under the terms of our amended credit facility  we are precluded from paying dividends until the credit facility is repaid 
net cash flow related to financing activities for fiscal includes the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share and dividends paid to shareholders of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
the only financing activity in fiscal was proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
at january   we had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventory is treated as a non current asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because it is a depreciable asset and a portion of this asset is not reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of our revenue  the classification of this asset as non current results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is reflected as a reduction in working capital 
consequently  we believe that working capital is not an appropriate measure of our liquidity and we anticipate that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
recently  blockbuster  the industry leader  has announced that it intends to restate its financial statements to classify its rental inventory as a current asset 
we will evaluate and reconsider our accounting treatment in the future when we are able to fully assess differences between blockbuster s facts and circumstances and ours 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates include our policies with respect to rental inventory amortization  impairment of long lived assets and tangible assets  including goodwill  estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in purchase accounting  and determining the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
rental inventory a major component of our cost structure is the amortization of our rental inventory 
rental inventory is amortized to an estimated residual value over an estimated useful life of up to two years 
we amortize the cost of rental inventory using an accelerated method designed to approximate the rate of revenue recognition 
this method is based on historical customer demand patterns from street date the date studios release various titles for distribution to our stores through the end of the average useful life 
in order to determine the appropriate useful lives and residual values  we consider the actual historical performance trends of our rental inventory and expectations of future trends and patterns 
we develop our estimates of amortization rates and useful lives to approximate the pattern of rental turns and sales of previously viewed used items in our rental inventory 
our established residual values are based on an evaluation of the selling prices we expect to realize from our customers on used inventory  prices observed in bulk sale transactions as well as the residual values established by competitors in our industry 
effective april   we changed our estimated residual value on vhs movies from to due to continued declines in the market value of vhs product 
we believe our updated estimated useful lives and residual values are appropriately matched to our current rental business and are consistent with industry trends 
however  should rental patterns of consumers change or should market values of previously viewed inventory continue to decline due to the transition to new formats  including ongoing vhs transition to dvd  anticipated transition to high definition dvd within one to three years  and release of new video game formats  this could necessitate revisions to our current rental amortization rates  further revisions to our estimated residual values or a combination of both courses of action 
we believe that any acceleration in the rental amortization rates would not have a long lasting impact as the majority of our current rental purchases are substantially depreciated within the first two to three months after street date under our existing policy 
in the past we have generally been able to anticipate the rate of transition from one format to another and manage our purchases  as well as inventory mix  to avoid significant losses on the ultimate disposition of previously viewed movies and games 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully anticipate the impact of ongoing or future format transitions and we could incur losses on sales of previously viewed movies in the future 
as of january  and january   we had million and million  respectively  in rental inventory on our balance sheet 
as of january   the net book value of our vhs rental inventory was approximately of the net book value of our total rental inventory 
long lived assets we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  furnishings and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
in order to do this  we make assumptions and estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the video retail industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon the excess of the carrying value over their fair values 
if we do not meet our operating forecasts  which could result in decreases to the undiscounted cash flows we use to determine whether impairment exists  and then to measure the amount of any resulting impairment  we may have to record impairment charges not previously recognized 
intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value 
with the acquisition of hollywood  the reporting units for movie gallery are as follows movie gallery  hollywood video and game crazy 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have recorded goodwill impairment charges in fiscal in the amount of million 
as of january   we have million in goodwill on our balance sheet  all of which relates to our hollywood video reporting unit 
the amount of the goodwill impairment charge we recognized in for the hollywood video reporting unit represents our best estimate of the charge based on the information available to us as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
because some aspects of the purchase price allocation have not been completed  we may need to make further adjustments to the purchase price allocation see discussion of deferred tax assets related to acquired assets and carryover tax attributes below 
some of the further revisions to the purchase price could impact our estimate of the goodwill impairment charge reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
any revisions to the amount we recorded based on our best estimate as of january  will be reflected in our statement of operations in future periods 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses based on historical experience and available information at the acquisition date 
we engage independent valuation specialists to assist when necessary 
if information becomes available subsequent to the acquisition date that would materially impact the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations  we may be required to adjust the purchase price allocation 
with the exception of the video update acquisition in and the hollywood acquisition  we have not experienced any significant adjustments to the valuation of assets or liabilities acquired in business combinations in the last seven years 
prior to the hollywood acquisition our acquisitions have typically been small businesses for which we generally do not assume liabilities and for which the assets acquired consist primarily of inventory  fixtures  equipment and intangibles 
we treated the acquisition of hollywood as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes  and as such  hollywood s assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair value as determined based  in part  on a valuation report performed by an independent valuation specialist 
the purchase price for the acquisition  including transaction costs  has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  april  the purchase price allocation is substantially final for all items except deferred income taxes and we expect further adjustments may be required in as we complete our analysis of the acquired tax basis of certain assets and carryover tax attributes of hollywood 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  in prior years we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards that we acquired in the acquisition of video update 
in  we established additional valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that we have determined may not be realized 
in forming our conclusion about the future recoverability of the net operating losses and tax credits  we considered  among other things  the applicable provisions of the federal income tax code  which place certain limitations on the deductibility of acquired net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  as well as other limitations that may apply to the future deductibility of these net operating losses and tax credits 
we also considered the availability of reversing taxable temporary differences during the carryforward period  the length of the available carryforward period  recent operating results  our expectations of future taxable income during the carryforward period  internal revenue service irs interpretive guidance and judicial rulings 
if facts and circumstances in the future should warrant elimination or reduction of our valuation allowances related to these net operating losses and tax credits  our effective income tax rate  which was  and for fiscal  and  respectively  could be substantially lower than the statutory federal income tax rate 
likewise  if our future operating results are not consistent with our expectations  or changes in tax law have adverse consequences on us  we may be required to further increase our valuation allowances in future periods 
any such changes could cause our effective tax rate to differ materially from historical trends 
federal tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change  as defined by the federal income tax code 
such an ownership change occurred on april   concurrent with our acquisition of hollywood 
in addition  previous ownership changes occurred with respect to hollywood prior to our acquisition and an ownership change also occurred upon our acquisition of video update 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is subject to restrictions pursuant to these provisions 
utilization of the federal net operating loss and tax credits will be limited annually and any unused limitation in a given year may be carried forward to the next year 
if our estimates of the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that will not be fully realized change  further revisions to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
depending on the circumstances  some of these revisions may have an impact on our future income tax expense  while other revisions may be charged or credited to goodwill 
there is a reasonable possibility that an exposure to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available on the ownership change dates exists due to subjectivity in the calculation of the limitations 
the range of the potential exposure is between million and million on a tax effected basis 
pursuant to the provisions of eitf  uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination  any adjustments to deferred tax assets recorded at the date of acquisition  due to resolution of this uncertainty which may not occur for many years will be recorded as an adjustment to increase or decrease goodwill  regardless of the time that has elapsed since the acquisition date 
the effect of a decrease in tax reserves and related valuation allowances established in purchase accounting will be applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition  second to reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition  and third  to reduce income tax expense 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
a portion of any future impairment charges associated with goodwill will not be tax deductible and will result in an increased income tax expense in the quarter the impairment is recorded 
the remainder will be allocated to tax deductible goodwill acquired in the hollywood acquisition 
to the extent any future impairment charges are attributed to tax deductible goodwill  we would record deferred tax benefits or reduce deferred tax liabilities  and this portion would not have an impact on our income tax expense or effective tax rate 
amortization expense associated with separately identified  finite lived intangible assets  such as the game crazy trademark  is likewise not tax deductible  but the tax effects of any future impairment charges or amortization associated with these assets would be offset by deferred taxes created in purchase accounting  and therefore  will not affect our income tax expense or effective tax rate going forward 
in the fourth quarter of hollywood applied for a change in accounting method with the irs to accelerate the deduction of store pre opening supplies and the amortization of dvd and vhs movies and video games 
permission was granted for the change in accounting method to accelerate the deduction of store pre opening supplies 
the application for the accelerated deduction of dvd and vhs movies and video games is under review by the irs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we have entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally to hedge against fluctuation in variable interest rates on our short term and long term debt 
the interest payable on the credit facility is based on variable interest rates equal to a specified eurodollar rate or base rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  as required by the credit facility  we have entered into a two year interest rate swap to exchange million of the variable rate credit facility debt for fixed rate debt 
if variable base rates were to increase  our interest expense on an annual basis would increase by approximately million on the non hedged principal  based on both the outstanding balance on the credit facility as of january  and the credit facility s mandatory principal payment schedule 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risks associated with our canadian and mexican operations 
historically  canadian exchange rates have been relatively stable  and we believe the impact of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will be immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
based on pro forma fiscal results including vhq  a hypothetical change in the canadian exchange rate would not have a significant effect on either our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our mexican operations are currently limited to nine locations  which we do not believe to be significant enough to result in a material impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
