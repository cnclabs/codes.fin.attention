item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview winnebago industries  inc is a leading motor home manufacturer with a proud history of manufacturing recreation vehicles for the last years 
our current retail market share of class a and class c motor home retail sales is percent for calendar year to date through august according to statistical surveys  inc there was a change in direction of the company following our founder s death in we divested ourselves of unprofitable business ventures with a strategy to refocus on producing quality motor homes in a profitable manner 
we measure profitability by using five guidelines return on assets roa  return on equity roe  return on invested capital roic  operating income as a percent of net revenues  and net income as a percent of net revenues 
our primary goal is to be a leader in profitability in the recreation vehicle industry 
our financial performance for the last ten years is evidence of this focus on profitability 
as a result of our performance  we have returned significant profits back to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends 
for example  since  we have repurchased million shares of common stock adjusted for the for stock split effective march  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in fiscal  we saw two principal factors impact us financially volume decline and a product mix shift 
industry retail sales per statistical surveys  inc  of class a and class c motor homes calendar year to date through august were down percent  we believe  in response to rising interest rates and record fuel prices 
although our volume decline was not as extreme as the industry retail decline due to the popularity of our new class c product offerings  our volume did decrease percent from last fiscal year 
we also noted a trend in the motorized retail market during fiscal towards lower priced products 
consequently  we have seen a shift in the mix of products that we sold to more class c and lower priced class a products 
as a result of both lower volumes and the shift in mix to lower priced products during fiscal  our net 
table of contents revenues decreased and our profit margins were negatively impacted 
however  we remained solidly profitable overall in fiscal  with earnings of million  or per diluted share 
we also generated a record level of operating cash flow in fiscal of million due in large part to aggressive management of inventory and receivable levels 
company outlook the rv industry is cyclical and susceptible to slowdowns in the general economy 
rv industry sales have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
some of the factors that contribute to this cyclicality include fuel availability and costs  interest rate levels  the level of discretionary spending and availability of credit and consumer confidence 
an extended continuation of these conditions would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the motorized portion of the recreation vehicle industry has experienced a volume decline now for over a year 
we will continue to adjust our factory schedule as necessary to reflect the demand for our products 
should fuel prices remain lower than the record levels seen in the summer of  interest rates continue to remain stable or decline and rv consumer sentiment begin to rise  the motor home market may improve next spring 
order backlog for our motor homes was as follows year ended aug 
 product mix aug 
 product mix decrease change class a gas class a diesel total class a class c total backlog total approximate revenue dollars in thousands dealer inventory units we include in our backlog all accepted purchase orders from dealers shippable within the next six months 
orders in backlog can be canceled or postponed at the option of the purchaser at any time without penalty and  therefore  backlog may not necessarily be an accurate measure of future sales 
long term demographics are favorable for us as our target market of consumers age and older is expected to substantially increase over the next years due to the aging of the baby boom market 
also  according to a study conducted by the university of michigan  the age at which the motor home consumer is purchasing motor homes has broadened 
motor home buyers are entering the market earlier that in the past  as young as  and living active and healthier lives with more buyers remaining in the rv lifestyle over the age of the study also indicates that owners are now using their motor homes for more than just traditional camping  having a positive impact on long term motor home market growth 
the study shows that motor homes are used to pursue consumers many lifestyle passions which may include riding their atvs in the desert or going to motor sports events or tailgating at sporting events
