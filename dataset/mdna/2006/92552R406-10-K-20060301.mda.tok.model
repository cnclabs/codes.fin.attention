item a 
risk factors 
because of the following  as well as other variables affecting viad s operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
viad s businesses and operating results are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions 
viad s businesses are highly sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by increases and decreases in costs of materials and operating supplies 
operating results for ges and exhibitgroup depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures 
these factors depend in part on the strengths or weaknesses of particular industries in which exhibitors operate 
the number and size of exhibitions generally decrease during periods of adverse economic conditions and increase when general economic conditions are positive 
further  many exhibitors view a portion of their marketing budget as discretionary  and  as a result  marketing budgets are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when general economic conditions deteriorate  resulting in exhibitors reusing or refurbishing old exhibits rather than purchasing new exhibits 
marketing expenditures often are not increased  and new exhibits not purchased  until general economic conditions improve 
as a result  during periods of adverse general economic conditions  the operating results of ges and exhibitgroup may be adversely affected 
similarly  revenues from the travel and recreation businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel 
this amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions 
viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry  particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries 
the success of viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people  whether exhibitors  exhibition attendees or other travelers  to travel  which is in turn dependent upon their ability and willingness to find and use transportation alternatives and accommodations 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole  and particularly the airline and hotel industries  generally also adversely affect viad s businesses and results of operations 
factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices  increased security requirements  weather conditions  airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities 
unexpected events of this nature in the future  or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations  could materially adversely affect viad s businesses and results of operations 
viad s businesses are seasonal  which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods 
ges generally reports higher revenues during the first and second quarters of each year 
ges reports its lowest revenues in the fourth quarter and exhibitgroup reports its lowest revenues in the third quarter 
the travel and recreation businesses are also seasonal  experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters these quarters accounted for approximately percent of the travel and recreation businesses revenues 
because of the seasonal nature of these businesses  adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could particularly affect the operating results of viad s businesses 
exhibition rotation may impact overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult 
the business activities of ges and exhibitgroup are largely dependent upon the frequency  timing and location of exhibitions and events 
for example  some large exhibitions are not held annually they may be held once every two or three years or longer  and some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than the times at which they have historically been held 
in addition  the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years 

table of contents the results of operations of ges and exhibitgroup can fluctuate significantly as a result of this rotation 
the geographic rotation of exhibitions requires viad to maintain a high degree of flexibility of resources including personnel and equipment and may result in a business generating lower margins in a given period if exhibitions shift to higher cost cities 
as a consequence of these factors  the operating results for these businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year  making periodic comparisons difficult 
transportation disruptions could adversely affect viad s businesses and operating results 
ges and exhibitgroup rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions  warehouse facilities and customer facilities 
if they were unable to secure the services of these independent transportation carriers at favorable rates  it could have a material adverse affect on these businesses and their results of operations 
in addition  disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions  which may have a material adverse affect on their businesses and operating results 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
a significant portion of viad s employees are unionized and viad is party to over collective bargaining agreements  with approximately one third requiring renegotiation each year 
if labor negotiations force the company to increase wages or benefits and thus increase total labor costs  the increased costs could either be absorbed which adversely affect operating margins or passed to the customers  which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices 
in either event  viad s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 
moreover  if the company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective bargaining process  the union may call for a strike or other work stoppage 
if a strike were to occur  viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skill sets to perform many of the services  and this could adversely affect the company s businesses and results of operations 
viad competes in competitive industries  and increased competition could negatively impact operating results 
viad competes in highly competitive industries 
competition in the convention and event services and exhibit design and construction services industries is on the basis of price and service level  among other things 
to the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies  viad may be required to lower its prices and rates  thereby adversely affecting operating results 
if viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the failure of a large customer to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities may adversely impact revenues 
although no single customer accounts for more than seven percent of the revenue of any of viad s business segments  ges is dependent upon a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and exhibitgroup has a number of large customer accounts 
the loss of any of these large customers may adversely affect results of operations 
in addition  ges s revenues may be significantly impacted if certain convention facilities chose to in source electrical  plumbing and other services that have represented revenue generating opportunities for ges 
when ges is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition  the exhibition organizer contractually grants ges an exclusive right to perform these electrical and plumbing services  subject in each case to the convention facility s option to in source the services either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider 
many convention facilities are currently under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry  including decreased usage and revenues 
as a result  some of these convention facilities may seek to in source all or a large portion of these services 
if a large number of facilities with which ges has these relationships seek to move these facilities services in house  ges s revenues and operating results could be affected 
viad s key businesses are relationship driven 
the business activities of ges and exhibitgroup are heavily focused on client relationships  and  specifically  on very close collaboration and interaction between teams from the client and ges or exhibitgroup  as the case may be 
this close relationship requires the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide 
table of contents top quality service 
viad has in the past lost  and may in the future lose  important customers if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the company and take that customer to a competitor 
liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations 
viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over seven decades and involving approximately  previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses  such as the manufacturing of locomotives  buses  industrial chemicals  fertilizers  pharmaceuticals  leather  textiles  food and fresh meats 
some of these businesses used raw materials that have been  and may continue to be  the subject of litigation 
moreover  some of the raw materials used  and the waste produced  by these businesses have been and are the subject of us federal and state environmental regulations  including laws enacted under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or its state law counterparts 
in addition  viad may incur other liabilities  resulting from indemnification or warranty claims involving sold subsidiaries as well as from past operations of those of predecessors or their subsidiaries 
although the company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover these future liabilities  results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions  and reserves or insurance become inadequate

two bus terminals and three garages are owned 
the icefield tour facility and gondola lift operation are operated through lease agreements with parks canada and all other properties are leased 
management believes that the company s facilities in the aggregate are adequate and suitable for their purposes and that capacity is sufficient for current needs 
item legal proceedings 
viad and certain subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to certain of these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial condition or results of operations 
viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if the company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become 
table of contents subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders 
as is the case with many companies  viad also faces exposure for actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations 
although it is a party to certain environmental disputes  viad believes that any resulting liabilities  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
adjusted ebitda is also used by management to assess viad s ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and finance growth 
income before impairment losses is defined by viad as income from continuing operations before the after tax effect of impairment losses and is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of impairment losses 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not a substitute for  other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to these non gaap measures are net income and income from continuing operations  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
similarly  although income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  its use is limited because it does not consider impairment losses 
because adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses do not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income and income from continuing operations  respectively  as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment losses interest expense recoveries income tax expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income loss the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from compared to was driven by favorable operating income at exhibitgroup and to a lesser extent ges  as well as by favorable restructuring and corporate costs and by higher interest income 
the decrease in adjusted ebitda of million from compared to was driven by lower 
table of contents operating income at exhibitgroup and unfavorable restructuring charges 
partially offsetting this was higher operating income at ges and travel and recreation services 
a reconciliation of income before impairment losses to income loss from continuing operations is as follows in thousands income before impairment losses impairment losses  net of tax income loss from continuing operations see results of operations below for a discussion of fluctuations in income before impairment losses 
results of operations vs 
revenues for increased percent to million from million in growth in ges s products and services group and continued improvement in the exhibition and event industry as well as increases in the travel and recreation business contributed to the increase 
income before income taxes was million for compared with a loss before income taxes of million for during  viad recorded asset impairment and related losses of   after tax related to damage caused by hurricane katrina to ges s new orleans facility 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax representing the entire carrying amount of exhibitgroup s goodwill and a charge of million million after tax related to the trademark intangible asset at exhibitgroup 
excluding these items  income before impairment losses for was million compared to million in the increase in income before impairment losses was primarily driven by improved operating margins at exhibitgroup  and to a lesser extent  an increase in net interest income combined with lower corporate activities costs 
in addition  viad recorded tax benefits of million in continuing operations in related to net favorable tax settlements as compared to million in income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  up from a loss of million  or per diluted share  in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for net income for included income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  primarily related to net favorable tax settlements associated with previously sold operations  compared to million in  or per diluted share 
ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in base same show growth over  which is revenue growth generated from shows that occur in the same city and same quarter each year 
this growth was attributed to continued improvement in the exhibition and event industry and to increased efforts of the products and services group  which provides elective services to exhibitors 
segment operating income increased slightly to million in from million in operating margins decreased to percent in from percent in as a result of the change in revenue mix from material handling revenue to products and services revenue 
exhibitors are using lighter weight exhibits and bringing fewer products to the show floor  which puts pressure on higher margin material handling revenue 
higher petroleum costs and the disruption of exhibition activity caused by hurricane katrina also had a negative impact on ges s operating margins 
during the third quarter of  viad recorded asset impairment and related losses of   after tax related to damage caused by hurricane katrina to ges s new orleans facility 
ges s new orleans operation has historically generated less than five percent of its annual revenue and at the time of the hurricane  ges had already realized a majority of the revenue budgeted for new orleans 
ges is in the process of filing property and business interruption claims with its insurer 
ges s revenue growth is dependent upon  among other things  show rotation  general economic conditions and levels of exhibitor spending 
in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing signs of modest growth in terms of square footage and number of exhibitors 
management believes that further growth in the economy and corporate earnings could lead to increased show spending 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
additionally  exhibitors in industries undergoing significant consolidation tend to underperform 
this has the effect of reducing the number of buyers and or sellers 
ges has a diversified revenue base and is generally insulated from industry specific trends 

table of contents although the exhibition and event environment appears to be improving  ges is experiencing pressure on material handling revenue as discussed above 
material handling revenue is a key driver in the official services contractor business model 
if this trend continues  future operating margins may be negatively affected 
in response to lower material handling revenue and increased labor and other costs  management continues to emphasize cost containment  productivity improvements and revenue growth through greater market penetration into exhibitor elective spending 
management is also implementing a petroleum surcharge and pursuing price increases 
ges and exhibitgroup are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  approximately one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup 
exhibitgroup 
revenue for exhibitgroup was million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
segment operating income for was  versus a loss of million in operating results for include million in legal fees net of million in recoveries incurred to protect intellectual property rights in exhibitgroup s kiosk business as discussed below 
despite these costs  the significant improvement in operating results was due to management s continued focus on initiatives to increase sales and gross margins and to drive cost savings  process and quality service improvements 
exhibitgroup s operating results also benefited somewhat from a slight improvement in the mix of construction revenue  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
construction revenue has higher margins than show services provided by exhibitgroup 
while the mix of construction revenue including kiosk construction improved slightly in as compared to  it remains in the range of to percent of exhibitgroup s total revenue 
this range is well below the historical norms of to percent  as many exhibitors continue to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing orders for new construction 
although exhibitgroup is experiencing improvement in exhibit construction activity  including an increase in requests for proposal and a slight improvement in construction revenue mix  visibility over future revenues continues to be poor 
future revenues  which are dependent upon customer marketing budgets  could decline and operating income could be similarly affected 
management remains focused on sales initiatives  cost control  productivity enhancements  customer service improvements and innovative pricing strategies in order to grow revenues and to preserve and increase operating margins over the longer term 
during the year  viad was involved in claims and counter claims related to unfair competitive practices and violation of intellectual property rights related to exhibitgroup s kiosk business 
in july  the parties involved settled the litigations and entered into consent judgments that recognize the validity and value of viad s intellectual property rights  including viad s copyrights

viad recorded income from discontinued operations of million  or per share  in related to tax matters associated with previously sold operations  primarily favorable foreign tax settlements 
including income from discontinued operations  viad s net loss was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent compared to million in this increase largely resulted from an increase in revenues from ges s products and services group as well as the result of positive show rotation 
this rotation included shows such as international manufacturing technology show  minexpo  international baking industry expo and international woodworking machinery furniture supply fair  which occurred in but not in favorable rotation from these shows was partially offset by negative show rotation in the second quarter of as well as the loss of the north american international auto show in detroit due to certain contractor requirements

during  ges experienced a ten day work stoppage in las vegas by the teamsters union and incurred direct costs of approximately million  mainly related to security  thereby negatively affecting operating results 
operating results were also negatively impacted by severe hurricane activity in the southeast  the effects of which were not fully quantifiable 
ges also experienced pressure on higher margin material handling revenue as exhibitors used lighter exhibits and brought fewer products to the show floor 
additionally  ges was not able to fully reflect in its prices the increased costs for petroleum based commodities such as carpet  plastics and fuel experienced in the latter part of exhibitgroup 
revenues for exhibitgroup were million for  down percent from million in the decline in revenues was driven mainly by weak demand for the design and construction of new exhibits  primarily due to diminished corporate spending and continued softness in the general economy  as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing orders for new construction 
customer losses also contributed to the overall revenue decline 
these losses occurred as the result of unfavorable pricing  which management believes would have led to unprofitable business 

table of contents segment operating loss was million for compared to operating income of million in the decline in operating income was due to the continued erosion of sales revenue  particularly new construction revenue that resulted in a less profitable mix of business 
margins on construction revenue are roughly twice that of show services provided by exhibitgroup 
construction revenues  including exhibit and kiosk construction  accounted for only to percent of exhibitgroup s total revenues in compared to to percent in and compared to historical norms of to percent 
this change in the revenue mix has contributed to lower margins and operating losses despite cost control efforts

 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires companies to test goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis 
impairment testing is also required between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the third quarter of  exhibitgroup s operating results were affected by a significant reduction in revenue from new exhibit construction that caused management to reduce its outlook for the full year 
as a result of this potential impairment indicator  viad performed interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for the exhibitgroup reporting unit 
based on this interim testing  management concluded that a goodwill impairment loss was necessary and that a trademark intangible impairment loss was probable 
accordingly  viad recorded a charge of million million after tax  representing the entire carrying amount of exhibitgroup s goodwill  and a charge of million million after tax representing management s preliminary estimate of the trademark s impairment 
management finalized the valuation of the trademark during the fourth quarter of and recorded an additional impairment charge of million  after tax

viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to certain of these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations 
in  certain retained liabilities of approximately million relating to previously sold operations were reclassified from long term to current liabilities as the company anticipates that resolution should occur within the next year 
to the extent that viad s cash payments are greater or less than the amount reserved  the difference will be recorded through discontinued operations 
viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if the company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of viad s reporting units 
the fair value of viad s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
viad s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually as of october of each year 
as of december   viad had recorded 
table of contents goodwill of million and million related to ges and travel and recreation services  respectively 
during  viad recorded an impairment loss representing the entire carrying amount of goodwill related to exhibitgroup 
sfas no 
also requires annual impairment testing of intangible assets not subject to amortization 
as of december   viad had intangible assets with indefinite lives of million  which primarily consisted of a trademark intangible related to exhibitgroup for which viad recorded an aggregate impairment loss of million in the fair value of the trademark intangible is estimated based on expected future cash flows 
if exhibitgroup s operating performance were to deteriorate in the future  further impairment losses could result 
viad s policy is to test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually as of october of each year 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding viad s goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
viad does not have a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets as management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts or had previously conducted significant operations 
accordingly  the company has recorded accrued liabilities associated with specific us federal  state  local and foreign tax audit exposures expected to arise in connection with such audits 
as of december  and  viad had million and million  respectively  accrued for these exposures 
if amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad would record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent that the company has favorable settlements  or determines that amounts accrued are no longer needed  such liabilities would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable  or in some cases through discontinued operations  in the period such determination is made 
viad s policy is to retain amounts accrued for tax audit exposures until final resolution or settlement with the appropriate taxing authority 
based on tax audits in process and other factors  management currently estimates that tax issues of approximately million exclusive of any federal tax effects could potentially be resolved or settled during resulting in a decrease of accrued income taxes 
to the extent these tax resolutions or settlements occur  they would result in cash payments and or the reversal of accrued income taxes which may include amounts related to previously discontinued operations 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pension and other postretirement benefits prior to the spin off of moneygram  viad had trusteed  frozen defined benefit pension plans that covered certain employees and were funded by the company 
viad also maintained certain unfunded defined benefit pension plans which provided supplemental benefits to select management employees 
with the spin off of moneygram  the defined benefit pension obligation associated with the company s primary funded plan was transferred to moneygram while viad retained the obligations related to two smaller funded plans 
in addition  the liabilities associated with the majority of the unfunded plans were transferred to moneygram while viad retained the obligations related to plans for certain continuing subsidiaries 
these plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates making no contribution to its funded pension plans and contributing  to its unfunded pension plans in 
table of contents viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was ten percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average discount rates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate used in determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost for the years ended december  and were both percent 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine net periodic other postretirement benefit cost for the years ended december  and were both percent

 which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees 
based on this method  viad has not recognized compensation expense related to stock options in its financial statements as the stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant

r and addresses the classification of stock options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
this guidance applies to stock options that require or permit  at the holder s election  cash settlement of the option upon a change of control of the entity or other event 
fsp fas r clarifies that stock options that contain such a cash settlement feature should be accounted for as liabilities if and when the contingent cash settlement event becomes probable of occurring 
on the date this determination is made  the liability for the award is measured at fair value and  to the extent that this liability exceeds the amount previously recognized  the excess is recognized as compensation cost 
viad s stock options generally contain cash settlement features upon a change in control of the company as defined in viad s omnibus incentive plan 
however  management believes that this cash settlement event would not be considered probable on the adoption of sfas no 
r and therefore  the outstanding stock options are not considered liability awards pursuant to fsp fas r the classification of stock options and similar instruments is also subject to the guidance contained in the sec s accounting series release no

in those circumstances  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if it can be reasonably estimated 
fin further clarifies that the liability should be recorded when incurred  which would typically coincide with the acquisition  construction and or through the normal operation of the asset
