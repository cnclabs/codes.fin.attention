table of contents overview we design  market  and administer compensation and benefit programs for companies supplementing and securing employee benefits and provide executive compensation and related consulting services to us corporations  banks  and healthcare organizations 
a majority of our revenues result from commissions paid by insurance companies that underwrite the insurance policies used to finance our clients benefit programs 
most of our clients benefit programs are financed by business owned life insurance and other financial products 
we pay commissions to employees and independent producers based upon a percentage of our commission revenue 
we work closely with clients to design customized products that meet the specific organizational needs of the client and with insurance companies to develop unique policy features and competitive pricing 
a significant portion of our growth has been acquisition related 
business owned life insurance programs have tax advantages associated with the products that are attractive to our clients 
a portion of our product offerings are interest rate sensitive 
changes in tax and legislative laws can have an affect on our business 
we have been expanding our compensation consulting practices to diversify our product offerings 
the largest component of our general and administrative expenses is salary and other employee related costs

proxy disclosure on january   the securities and exchange commission released a proposal that would revamp the current disclosure requirements for executive compensation  related party transactions  director independence  and other corporate governance matters 
the purpose of the proposal is to provide shareholders with more comprehensive information on how a company compensates its directors and certain executive officers 
it is anticipated that these requirements may become effective for the proxy season 
if these proposed rules are enacted  it may lead to more engagements for the pearl meyer partners practice 
supplemental compensation agreement amendment on february   we amended a supplemental compensation agreement with one of our insurance carriers 
the contract has been extended from september  through september  in exchange for a longer term arrangement  the percentage used to calculate future payments based on our inforce block of business was reduced 
we expect that revenue based on our inforce block of business will be approximately million less in when compared to however  there are additional opportunities to earn revenue should we meet certain production targets for new business 
yield curve in  the flattening yield curve proved challenging to our sales force for closing new insurance cases in the banking market 
in early  the yield curve has become inverted which makes our existing fixed rate insurance products even less attractive 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and the results of operations  and which require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue sources and recognition our operating segments derive revenue primarily from commissions and other compensation paid by insurance companies issuing the policies underlying our client s benefit programs  program design and administrative service fees paid by our clients  executive compensation and benefit related consulting fees  and fees for legislative liaison and related advisory services 
our commission revenue is typically recurring  paid annually  and extends for a period of twenty years or more after the sale 
commissions are paid by insurance companies and vary by policy and by program and represent percentage of the premium or the cash surrender value of the insurance policies underlying the program 
first year commissions and consulting fees 
first year commissions and consulting fees are derived from three principal sources a the commission we earn when the client first purchases the policies  which revenue is recognized at the time the application is substantially completed  the client is contractually committed to purchase the insurance policies and the premiums are paid which is the effective date of the insurance policy by the client  to the insurance company or  in certain instances  when cash is received  b fees for the services related to the enrollment and initial administration of the benefit programs and underlying policies  and c consulting fees 
our first year commission revenue is frequently subject to chargeback  which means that insurance companies retain the right to recover commissions paid in the event policies prematurely terminate 
the chargeback schedules differ by product and usually apply to first year commission only 
a typical chargeback schedule  based on a percent of first year commission  is as follows year year and year year and beyond given the homogenous nature of such cases and historical information about chargebacks  we believe we are able to accurately estimate the revenue earned 
we currently maintain a chargeback allowance  which is monitored on a quarterly basis for adequacy 
the chargeback allowance is calculated based on the average percentage rate of the last two years of chargebacks multiplied by the first year revenue for the trailing twelve months 
consulting fee revenue consists of fees charged for services we perform in advising our clients on their executive compensation programs and related consulting services  retirement  benefit  people strategy  compensation surveys  and fees from legislative and regulatory policy matters 
these fees are generally based on a rate per hour arrangement or a fixed monthly fee and are earned when the service is rendered 

table of contents renewal commission revenue and related fees 
renewal revenue is recognized on the date that the renewal premium is due or paid by the client to the insurance company depending on whether a policy is considered fixed or variable 
fixed renewal policies have predictable set premium amounts 
revenue on these policies is recognized on the premium due date 
variable renewal policy premiums can be based upon such items as value of underlying investments in the policy  cash surrender value of the policy  or mutual fund values 
in some cases  we are able to obtain information directly from the carriers allowing us to reasonably and reliably estimate the expected renewal premiums 
revenue is recognized based upon these estimates at a policy s renewal date 
for those policies where we are unable to obtain information to reasonably estimate the expected renewal premiums  revenue is not recognized until the confirmation has been received from the insurance carrier that the client s premium payment has been received 
we are notified in advance if a client plans to surrender  so adjustments in subsequent periods due to cancellations are infrequent and minor 
revenue associated with policies to be surrendered is not recognized 
administrative service fee revenue consists of fees we charge our clients for the administration of their benefit programs and is earned when services are rendered 
these revenues are mainly included in our renewal commissions and related fees line on our consolidated statements of income 
supplemental compensation arrangements 
a portion of our revenue is derived from certain supplemental compensation arrangements with insurance carriers 
these arrangements generate additional revenue with respect to primarily existing and  to a lesser extent  new blocks of business 
payments under such arrangements are typically based on the cash value or fair value of our existing in force business with these carriers at specified dates of measurement and  to a much lesser extent  based on the value of new business generated 
we realized approximately million  million and million in revenue under such arrangements for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we record revenue on a gross basis when we act as the principal in the transaction by helping clients select the right product or service  take responsibility for the acceptability of the products and services  provide services through employees and exclusive independent producers  have latitude in establishing the price the customer will pay  have discretion in carrier selection with multiple carriers  have chargeback and credit risk  and or are viewed by the client as the administrator of the program once the product is sold 
we record revenue on a net basis when we provide a lead on a case in the capacity of a finder and another company has control of the case and bears the credit risk ie  working directly with a client to determine the product and design of the plan 
intangible assets our intangible assets represent the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the tangible net assets associated with an acquisition 
our intangible assets consist of the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce at the acquisition date  non compete agreements with the former owners  other identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
non compete agreements are amortized over the period of the agreements and all other identifiable intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
the net present value of inforce revenue is typically amortized between and years the expected average policy duration 
the determination of the amortization schedule involves making certain assumptions related to persistency  expenses  and discount rates that are used in the calculation of the carrying value of inforce revenue 
if any of these assumptions change or actual experience differs materially from the assumptions used  it could affect the carrying value of the inforce revenue 

table of contents we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  mortality  lapse  and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by federal and various state authorities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider the likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
restructuring costs we make provisions for restructuring costs in accordance with sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
to determine the amounts expensed in any period  we estimate the amounts we will receive in the future for subleasing office space that is no longer required for our existing operations 
should these estimates not reflect actual results in future periods  we adjust the provision through the income statement

banking practice s first year commission revenue for the year ended december   was impacted by a soft market for boli products and the historically low long term interest rate environment 
on september   the treasury department issued initial guidance regarding changes to nonqualified deferred compensation plans necessitated by the american jobs creation act  passed in october the delay in this guidance created uncertainty in regards to amending existing plans and delayed the implementation of new plans for both the executive benefits practice and banking practice 
first year revenue in included approximately million from commissions received in connection with the exchange of policies related to our deferred compensation plans 
total revenue for the years ended december  and  included approximately million and million  respectively  related to supplemental compensation arrangements 
renewal revenue for the year ended december   was compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in renewal revenue was expected and is primarily a result of changes in contract renewal commission rates that carriers pay on certain products as the policies age at both the executive benefits practice and banking practice 
consulting fees for pearl meyer partners and federal policy group as a percentage of total revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  for the year ended december   executive compensation consulting services experienced an increase in demand over the prior year due to corporate focus on corporate governance and executive compensation 
commission and fee expense 
commission and fee expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the percentage paid in commission expense declined primarily due to an increasing percentage of sales by employee consultants who have a lower commission rate than independent producers and the mix of revenues 
renewal revenues generally have lower commissions than first year revenues 
in addition  supplemental compensation arrangements and consulting revenues typically have no related commission expense 

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributable to a decrease in bonus expense associated with weaker financial results in compared to amortization 
amortization expense decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decline is based on the scheduled timing of amortization of our inforce revenue streams purchased in acquisitions 
other income expense 
other income for the year ended december  included million of net life insurance proceeds following the death of an executive in our healthcare practice 
this amount is not subject to taxation 
the year ended december  results included a million write off of costs associated with a prospective securitization financing that was abandoned 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease relates to lower borrowing levels in compared to partially offset by higher interest rates 
income taxes

renewal revenue for the year ended december   was compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in renewal revenue is primarily the result of over funding of certain corporate plans in consulting fees for pearl meyer partners and federal policy group as a percentage of total revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  for the year ended december   consulting services experienced an increase in demand over the prior year due to corporate focus on corporate governance and executive compensation 
commission and fee expense 
commission and fee expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the amount paid in commission expense both in dollar terms and as a percent of revenue declined primarily due to an increasing percentage of sales by employee consultants who have a lower commission rate than independent producers 
in the second half of  banking practice acquired two of its former independent producer organizations 
some of the commission savings from sales by employees is spent in the form of increased operating expenses 
independent producers cover their operating expenses out of their commissions 
also impacting the commission percentage to revenue is the higher amounts of supplemental compensation arrangement revenues and consulting revenues that have no related commission expense 

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to expenditures associated with sarbanes oxley compliance million and approximately million of legal fees associated with the macdonald litigation

amortization expense decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  for year ended december   there were costs of approximately thousand relating to an adjustment to the purchase accounting for the longmiller acquisition 
the remaining decline is based on the scheduled timing of amortization of our inforce revenue streams purchased in acquisitions 
other operating expenses 
the year ended december  results included a million favorable settlement of litigation that reduced operating expenses 
human capital practice reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  several partners and staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the human capital practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization  of which million remained on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  during the year ended december   we recorded a net decrease to expense of approximately thousand relating to the human capital practice reorganization 
other income expense

net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share  versus net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  acquisition strategy our acquisition criteria focuses on the quality of management  future earnings  and the strategic fit with our company  as well as the growth potential of the target company 
in several of our acquisitions  we also acquire the financial value embedded in a book of recurring renewal business that is expected to be realized for many years after the acquisition takes place 
historically  our future renewal revenue stream has been the source of collateral for our line of credit  which we frequently use for acquisitions 
as we acquire more businesses that do not have this attribute  this may limit our future borrowing availability 
we typically structure a majority of the purchase price in cash 
we generally acquire little in the way of tangible assets  thus creating a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
the companies we acquire are frequently privately owned and structured as subchapter s corporations and the acquisitions are usually effected through a purchase of assets with the income taxed directly to the stockholders of the target 
from time to time we are involved in negotiations relating to the acquisition of companies in our industry or related industries 
some of these negotiations could involve companies whose acquisition would be highly material to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in connection with negotiating such transactions  even if the transactions are not completed 

table of contents human capital practice reorganization in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  four partners and six staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization of which million remains on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the remaining business of the human capital practice in consisted of actuarial retirement plan and investment advisory services 
effective january   the human capital practice was merged into the executive benefits practice 
supplemental compensation arrangements a portion of our revenue is derived from certain supplemental compensation arrangements with insurance carriers 
these arrangements generate additional revenue with respect to primarily existing and  to a lesser extent  new blocks of business 
payments under such arrangements are typically based on the cash value or fair value of our existing in force business with these carriers at specified dates of measurement and  to a much lesser extent  based on the value of new business generated 
we realized approximately million  million and million in revenue under such arrangements for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
future payment amounts would be negatively impacted by potential future surrenders of the inforce business or non renewal of the agreements and positively impacted by asset growth of these contracts

cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   million of cash was used for the acquisition of the businesses including contingent consideration payments to prior owners of businesses we acquired and million of cash was used for the purchases of fixed assets 
a substantial portion of the purchase price used to fund acquisitions has historically been paid in cash 
this is primarily due to our desire to avoid diluting our existing stockholders 
we expect acquisitions to continue to be financed primarily from available credit lines and possible additional equity 
however  we can offer no assurances such will be the case 

table of contents cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december   approximately million of cash was used for financing activities 
we used approximately million for the net repayment of borrowings  approximately million for payment of dividends  and million for the repurchase of our stock 
as of december   there was restricted cash of approximately million  a decrease of million from december   which will be used to pay down the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
this cash is not available for general corporate purposes  but is solely to service securitization indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
on august   we added a participant bank to our senior credit facility million and one of the existing participants increased their commitment million 
as a result  the current amount available under this facility is million 
as of december   there was million outstanding on the facility 
our assets are pledged to the bank group as part of the credit facility except for cash flows from commissions to be received upon the renewals of specified inforce policies acquired in connection with the acquisition of longmiller 
in september  we amended our credit agreement to allow for potential stock repurchases and dividend payments 
the remaining provisions of the agreement remained substantively the same 
our credit facility expires on december  we expect the credit facility to be renewed on substantially similar terms 
the restrictive covenants under the credit agreement provide for the maintenance of a minimum ratio of fixed charges  a maximum allowable leverage ratio  a minimum amount of net worth stockholders equity  and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide sufficient funds to service our debt obligations 
however  as our business grows  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will also continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that the net cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow requirements or that we will not require additional debt or equity financing in the future 
we may issue stock to finance future acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
set forth below is a summary presentation of our contractual obligations as of december   which are expected to become due and payable during the periods specified 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations contingent considerations for acquisitions total we expect to make significant cash outlays in future years for interest  taxes  and deferred compensation arrangements 
however  due to their variable nature  no amounts for these items have been included in the table above 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain of our expenses  such as compensation  benefits  and capital equipment costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
however  the majority of our service and administrative agreements with clients  which generate fee income  have a cost of living adjustment tied to the consumer price index 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had total outstanding indebtedness of million  or approximately of total market capitalization 
of our outstanding debt  million was subject to an average fixed rate of at december  of our outstanding debt  million was subject to fixed rates of at december  the amount outstanding on our three pooled trust preferred debt issues is million as of december  average interest rate of as of december  
on june  and february   we entered into interest rate swaps with a total non amortizing notional value of million and million  respectively  to hedge our libor based debt 
the terms of the interest rate swaps as of december  are as follows effective date maturity date notional amount at december  fixed rate to be paid variable rate to be received fair value as of december  june  december  million libor february  december  million libor may  march  million libor january  december  million libor total million on november   we entered into an interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of million and an effective date of january   which increases million each calendar quarter until december   and then remains at million 
the quarterly increase in the notional amount of this interest rate swap exactly offsets the amortizing notional amount of the january  interest rate swap 
the purpose of this swap is to hedge our remaining trust preferred libor based variable rate debt 
we have exposure to changing interest rates and  as discussed in note financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements  will engage in hedging activities  from time to time  to mitigate this risk 
the interest rate swaps we have entered into are used to hedge our interest rate exposure on the libor based variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest on the remaining million of unhedged debt at december   bears interest at three month libor plus a weighted average of basis points 
at our current borrowing level  a change in the interest rate will have an effect of approximately thousand on interest expense on an annual basis
