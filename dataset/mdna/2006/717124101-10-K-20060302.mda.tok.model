item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in this discussion  the words ppd  we  our and us refer to pharmaceutical product development  inc  together with its subsidiaries where appropriate 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance  expectations  predictions  assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical facts 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue  or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
these statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates that could be inaccurate and that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results might differ materially due to a number of factors  including those listed in potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and in item a 
risk factors 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
executive overview our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients 
as a result  we closely monitor the market for our services 
for a discussion of the trends affecting our market  see item business trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry 
although we cannot forecast the demand for cro services in  we believe the traditional market drivers for our industry are intact 
in  we will continue to focus on delivering timely  high quality services to our clients and on our business development efforts in our core markets 
we have historically conducted a significant amount of government sponsored research  and in july we were awarded a new five year contract to provide comprehensive research management and support to the national institute of allergy and infectious disease  or niaid  division of aids 
niaid is a component of the national institutes of health  an agency of the us department of health and human services 
the aggregate value of this contract is million  of which approximately million is expected to be for subcontractor costs  million for travel costs and other reimbursed out of pockets and the remaining million for development segment revenue 
we plan to continue our efforts to win new business in this significant market 
for  we believe there are specific opportunities for continued growth in certain areas of our business 
our latin american and european phase ii through iv units had strong operating and financial 
table of contents performance in and we believe there will be opportunities to continue this growth in these regions 
following the completion of our new bed phase i clinic in austin  texas in april  we continued to experience solid demand for these services 
designed to accommodate up to an additional beds if needed  we believe our state of the art clinic and ability to service large  complex studies should allow us to continue winning business in this arena and enable us to fully utilize our expanded phase i facilities 
similarly  in  the demand for our bioanalytical and gmp services increased and we are planning expansions and new services for our gmp laboratory facilities over the next two years 
we have continued to invest in scientific equipment in our bioanalytical laboratory and now have liquid chromatography mass spectrometry  or lcms  systems in this laboratory to process fluid samples for preclinical studies 
we review various metrics to evaluate our financial performance  including period to period changes in backlog  new authorizations  cancellation rates  revenue  margins and earnings 
in  we had record new authorizations of billion  an increase of over the cancellation rate for was compared to in on a net basis  authorizations were up in compared to backlog grew from billion as of december  to billion as of december  backlog by client type as of december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other 
backlog by client type as of december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other 
the change in the composition of our backlog from to is primarily the result of an increase in new authorizations from biotechnology companies and the addition of the large government contract mentioned above 
net revenue by client type for the year ended december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other compared to pharmaceutical  biotech and government other in the additional revenue from the biotechnology sector resulted from the increase in new biotechnology authorizations discussed above 
top therapeutic areas by net revenue for the year ended december  were anti infective anti viral  oncology  central nervous system  circulatory cardiovascular and endocrine metabolic 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for the year ended december   see results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  below 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
these capital expenditures were for land and building costs for a new corporate headquarters facility in wilmington  north carolina  computer software and hardware  scientific equipment for our phase i and laboratory units and a new corporate aircraft 
we made these investments to support our growing businesses and continued to implement a number of initiatives throughout to improve the efficiencies of our operations 
for  we expect to spend between million and million for capital expenditures 
in addition to the million expected to be spent in for the ongoing construction of our new headquarter building and related parking facility in wilmington  north carolina and the million to complete the construction of our new building in scotland  the majority of the remaining forecasted capital expenditures is related to up fit costs for facilities  information technology related expenditures and additional lab equipment 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and continue to generate cash from operations 
because of our cash position and free cash flow  in late  our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend and adopted a policy to pay annual cash dividends 
the annual cash dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends are not guaranteed and are subject to the discretion of and continuing determination by our board of directors that the policy remains in the best interests of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws 
in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of surromed  inc s biomarker business 
this acquisition expanded our discovery sciences segment by adding biomarker discovery and patient sample analysis to the services offered by us 
our preclinical oncology facility had a solid performance in and is now offering models to support diabetes drug development 
our discovery sciences segment also includes our compound partnering arrangements 
these collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and global drug development expertise to create new opportunities for growth and to share the risks and potential rewards of drug development with our clients 
for a background discussion of our compound collaborations  see item business our services our discovery sciences group compound programs 
in  we had mixed results on our two primary compound partnering programs 
on the positive front  we made significant progress on the dipeptidyl peptidase  or dpp  collaboration with takeda san diego  
table of contents inc formerly syrrx  inc in march  we completed the phase ib study in patients for the first dpp inhibitor and initiated the phase ii program for that inhibitor in april 
we also commenced the phase i first in man study for the second dpp inhibitor in april in july  we entered into an agreement under which takeda san diego acquired the development and commercialization rights to all dpp inhibitors previously granted to us under the collaboration agreement between ppd and syrrx 
under the new agreement  takeda san diego paid us a million up front payment in the third quarter of and assumed the responsibility for funding all future expenses associated with the development and commercialization of the dpp inhibitor program 
in january  takeda announced that the lead dpp candidate entered phase iii clinical development  and under our agreement with takeda san diego  we will be entitled to receive a million milestone payment on the dosing of the twentieth patient in the phase iii trials 
we will also be entitled to receive other potential development milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million upon the occurrence of specified clinical and regulatory milestones  and if a dpp product is ever approved for sale  royalties on net sales of any such product as well as sales based milestones up to an aggregate of million upon the achievement of specified sales thresholds 
our agreement with takeda san diego also provides that we will be the sole provider of clinical and bioanalytical services for phase ii and phase iii trials of dpp inhibitors conducted in the us and europe 
we do not know if or when takeda will obtain regulatory approval for a dpp inhibitor in the united states or any other country 
as a result  we do not know if we will ever receive any further milestone payments or royalties on any such dpp inhibitors 
for additional information on the agreement with takeda san diego  see our current reports on form k filed on july  and october  with regard to our collaboration with alza corporation on dapoxetine  an investigational compound for the treatment of premature ejaculation  in february  the fda accepted alza s nda and we received the million payment for this milestone in march however  as announced in october  alza received a not approvable letter from the fda on the dapoxetine nda 
under our license agreement with alza  we are entitled to receive future payments if regulatory milestones are achieved and royalty payments if dapoxetine is approved for sale 
although alza notified the fda that it will continue the global development program and intends to resubmit the nda  we do not know if or when alza will obtain regulatory approval for dapoxetine in the united states or any other country 
as a result  we do not know if we will ever receive any future dapoxetine milestone payments or royalties 
we are committed to our compound partnering strategy and believe it is an innovative way to use our cash resources and drug development expertise to drive mid to long term shareholder value 
for  we will continue to work on our existing collaborations and evaluate new opportunities in this arena 
acquisitions in february  we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of surromed  inc s biomarker business 
the assets acquired by us consist of equipment  fixtures  leasehold improvements  software and contracts 
the biomarker business supports drug discovery and drug development by identifying biomarkers using biological  chemical and bioinformatics expertise and technologies 
in exchange for the assets  we surrendered to surromed for cancellation all shares of preferred stock of surromed we held 
as additional consideration for the acquisition  we assumed approximately million of surromed liabilities under capital leases and additional operating liabilities  and guaranteed repayment of up to million under a surromed bank loan 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the exchange of assets of million 
the biomarker business is part of the discovery sciences segment 
for further details regarding this acquisition  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments in january  we purchased million shares of accentia biopharmaceuticals  inc series e convertible preferred stock for million 
accentia is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of late stage clinical products in the areas of respiratory disease and oncology 
in connection with our investment in  we also received a class a and class b warrant  each to purchase up to an additional million shares of series e convertible preferred stock for per share 
we exercised the class a warrant in january and the class b warrant in august in october  accentia completed its initial public offering of million shares of common stock for per share 
upon completion of the initial public offering  our million shares of series e convertible preferred stock were converted to  shares of accentia s common stock

we have committed to invest up to a maximum of million in the bay city fund iv 
capital calls through december  were million 
our capital commitment expires in june we anticipate that the balance of our capital commitment will be invested in the fund through a series of future capital calls made over the remaining period of our commitment 
in april  we purchased million shares of spotlight health series c convertible preferred stock for million and subsequently guaranteed a million line of credit 
in june  we purchased  shares of spotlight health s series d convertible preferred stock at per share for a total investment of million 
we recorded a charge to earnings for an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of its investment of million in as a result of several unexpected project delays and cancellations by its customers  spotlight health notified us in august that it was unable to continue as a going concern and was liquidating its assets 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million loss relating to our investment in spotlight health and the loan guarantee 
in december  we purchased  shares of oriel therapeutics  inc series a convertible preferred stock for million 
we also received  as part of the purchase  a warrant to purchase an equal number of shares of stock offered by oriel therapeutics in its next round of financing at a discount 
in april  we exercised the warrant for  shares of oriel therapeutics series b convertible preferred stock for million 
at the same time  we also purchased an additional  shares of oriel s series b for million 
in march  we loaned oriel million in the form of secured debt convertible into oriel therapeutics series b preferred stock at per share 
the loan is secured by a first lien on oriel s assets 
in june  we loaned oriel an additional million and received a warrant to purchase shares offered by oriel therapeutics in a future equity financing transaction 
we loaned oriel an additional million in november  bringing our total investment to million 
oriel therapeutics is a privately held company pursuing the development of technology to improve drug delivery in the treatment of respiratory and pulmonary diseases 
as a result of management s quarterly evaluations of our equity investments  during  we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our investment in spotlight health of million  oriel therapeautics of million and biodelivery sciences international  inc of million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these investments 
restructuring charge in  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with exiting our chemistry facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
these charges include lease payments and termination costs  net of sublease rentals  of approximately million and a loss on sale of assets used in our chemistry services of approximately million 
the lease termination liability will be paid over the remaining life of the lease  which expires in new business authorizations and backlog new business authorizations  which are sales of our services  are reflected in backlog when we enter into a contract or letter of intent or receive a verbal commitment 
authorizations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years 
we recognize revenue on these authorizations as services are performed 
our new authorizations for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
our backlog consists of new business authorizations for which the work has not started but is anticipated to begin in the future  and contracts in process that have not been completed 
as of december   the remaining 
table of contents duration of the contracts in our backlog ranged from one month to months with an average duration of months 
amounts included in backlog represent future revenue and exclude revenue that we have previously recognized 
once work begins on a project included in backlog  net revenue is recognized over the life of the contract as services are performed 
our backlog as of december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
for various reasons discussed in item business backlog  our backlog may never be recognized as revenue and is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future performance 
results of operations revenue recognition we record revenue from contracts  other than time and material contracts  on a proportional performance basis in our development segment 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare direct costs incurred through that date to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service 
changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized 
for time and material contracts in both our development and discovery sciences segments  we recognize revenue as hours are worked  multiplied by the applicable hourly rate 
for our phase i and laboratory businesses  we recognize revenue from unitized contracts as subjects or samples are tested  multiplied by the applicable unit price 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  we pay  on behalf of our customers  fees to investigators and test subjects as well as other out of pocket costs for items such as travel  printing  meetings and couriers 
our clients reimburse us for these costs 
as required by emerging issues task force  amounts paid by us as a principal for out of pocket costs are included in direct costs as reimbursable out of pocket expenses and the reimbursements we receive as a principal are reported as reimbursed out of pocket revenue 
in our statements of operations  we combine amounts paid by us as an agent for out of pocket costs with the corresponding reimbursements  or revenue  we receive as an agent 
during the years ended december   and  fees paid to investigators and other fees we paid as an agent and the associated reimbursements were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
most of the contracts for our development segment can be terminated by our clients either immediately or after a specified period following notice 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
therefore  revenue recognized prior to cancellation does not generally require a significant adjustment upon cancellation 
if we determine that a loss will result from the performance of a fixed price contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which such determination is made 
the discovery sciences segment also generates revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments in connection with licensing of compounds 
milestone payments are only recognized as revenue if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer  and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 

table of contents recording of expenses we generally record our operating expenses among the following categories direct costs  research and development  selling  general and administrative  depreciation  and amortization 
direct costs consist of amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process  and include direct labor and related benefit charges  other costs directly related to contracts  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs  as a percentage of net revenue  tend to and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies being conducted during any period of time 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of patent expenses  labor and related benefit charges associated with personnel performing internal research and development work  supplies associated with this work  consulting services and an allocation of facility and information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  sales  advertising and promotional expenses  recruiting and relocation expenses  administrative travel  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and costs related to operational employees performing administrative tasks 
depreciation expenses consist of depreciation costs recorded on a straight line method  based on estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  five years for laboratory equipment  two to five years for software  computers and related equipment and five to ten years for furniture and equipment  except for aircraft  which we depreciate over years 
we depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the relevant lease or the useful life of the improvement 
we depreciate property under capital leases over the life of the lease or the service life  whichever is shorter 
amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on intangible assets on a straight line method over the life of the intangible assets

the development segment generated net revenue of million  which accounted for of total net revenue for the increase in development net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the level of global cro phase ii through iv services we provided in as compared to the discovery sciences segment generated net revenue of million in  an increase of million from the increase in the discovery sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to the million up front payment we received from takeda san diego in connection with the dpp agreement we entered into in july and the million milestone payment we received from alza for the filing of the dapoxetine nda 
the remaining increase was primarily due to revenue generated by our biomarker business that we acquired from surromed 
in  we received a million payment from alza in connection with an amendment to the dapoxetine out license agreement 
total direct costs increased million to million in primarily as the result of an increase in the development segment direct costs 
development direct costs increased million to million in the primary reason for this increase was an increase in personnel costs of million 
personnel costs increased 
table of contents due to hiring additional employees in our global cro phase ii through iv division and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the us dollar 
the remaining million of this increase in development direct costs primarily consisted of increased facility costs and higher subcontractor costs to support the growth in the global cro phase ii through iv division 
discovery sciences direct costs increased million to million in the higher costs in related primarily to additional direct costs associated with the biomarker business acquired from surromed in february r d expenses increased million to million in r d expenses increased primarily as a result of increased spending in the first half of the year in connection with the dpp program with takeda san diego  including a million milestone payment made by us as a result of the commencement of the phase ii studies in april based on the new dpp agreement with takeda san diego entered into in july  takeda san diego is responsible for future development and commercialization costs for the dpp program 
thus  we do not expect to incur any material future r d expense for the dpp program 
sg a expenses increased million to million in as a percentage of total net revenue  sg a expenses decreased slightly to in compared to in the increase in sg a expenses in absolute dollars includes additional personnel costs of million 
the increase in personnel costs related to training costs for new personnel  higher levels of operations infrastructure to manage direct personnel and changes in utilization levels

income from operations in was negatively impacted by the increase in r d expenses discussed above and by approximately million due to foreign currency fluctuation  primarily the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and brazilian real 
although these currency movements increased net revenue in the aggregate  the negative impact on income from operations is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the united states 
in these cases  revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the us dollar  but the costs associated with performing these contracts and maintaining the foreign infrastructure  which are paid in local currency  increase when translated to us dollars resulting in lower operating profits 
during  we recorded a foreign currency hedging loss of million  resulting in a net impact to income from operations of million attributable to foreign currency transactions 
income from operations in includes a million dapoxetine milestone payment from alza and a million restructuring charge associated with exiting our chemistry facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
during  we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our investments in spotlight health of million  oriel therapeutics of million and biodelivery sciences international of million 
in august  spotlight health notified us that it was unable to continue as a going concern and was liquidating its assets 
the charge to earnings in the amount of million consisted of our remaining equity investment of million and a liability in the amount of million based on the outstanding balance of spotlight health s revolving line of credit which we guaranteed 
the write down of oriel therapeutics was based primarily on historical and projected performance and expected cash needs to continue the implementation of its business plan 
the write down of biodelivery sciences was based on a sustained decrease in the publicly quoted market price that we believe was other than temporary and biodelivery sciences limited cash resources 

table of contents during  we recorded a charge to earnings for an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of our investment in chemokine therapeutics corp 
of million 
we deemed our investment in chemokine to be impaired as a result of the issuance of shares to new investors at a lower valuation than our original investment 
our provision for income taxes increased million to million in our effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate for the period was positively impacted by a million reduction in our valuation allowance provided for the deferred tax asset relating to realized and unrealized investment losses 
the reduction was a result of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards that previously had a valuation allowance recorded against them  recognition of capital gains for the surromed transaction  the million dapoxetine nda milestone payment and the million takeda san diego up front payment  projections of future capital gains  and recognition of ordinary investment losses 
this reduction in the valuation allowance decreased the effective tax rate by 
during  our effective tax rate was positively impacted by the million tax benefit which we recorded as a result of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards that previously had a valuation allowance recorded against them 
the remaining difference in our effective rates for and is due to the change in the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates

development direct costs increased million to million in the primary reason for this increase was an increase in personnel costs of million 
personnel costs increased due to 
table of contents hiring additional employees in our global cro phase ii through iv division  increased incentive compensation accruals and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the us dollar 
in  incentive compensation accruals were lower than our normal accrual levels as a result of our financial and operating performance in that period 
the remaining million of this increase in development direct costs primarily consisted of higher facility costs related to the increase in personnel and higher subcontractor costs to support the growth in our business 
discovery sciences direct costs decreased million to million in the higher costs in related primarily to a million milestone payment for dapoxetine to eli lilly company that did not occur again in because we acquired the dapoxetine patents from lilly in december gross margin  defined as net revenue less direct costs divided by net revenue  from the development segment was in compared to in the majority of this decrease was attributable to increased incentive compensation accruals and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the us dollar 
the remaining variance relates to expected fluctuations from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
r d expenses decreased million to million in in the fourth quarter of  we acquired from eli lilly company the patents for the compound dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders 
we paid lilly million in cash and agreed to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales of dapoxetine  if any  in excess of million 
the million payment to lilly was recorded to research and development expenses because dapoxetine was still in development and had not been approved for sale in any country 
excluding that payment  r d expenses increased million in compared to as a result of increased spending in connection with our existing compound partnering arrangements

we recorded the write down of our investment in spotlight health primarily based on its historical and projected financial performance and issuance of shares to a new investor at a lower valuation 
biodelivery sciences is a publicly traded company  so we based the write down of our investment in that company on the closing price of its securities as of december  although these securities had traded above cost for short periods of time throughout  we believe that due to the uncertainty of biodelivery sciences strategic direction  the decline in value was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charge to earnings

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  including our new corporate headquarters facility  expansion of services  possible acquisitions  investments and compound collaborations  geographic expansion  dividends  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we have historically funded our operations and growth  including acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in financial instruments that are rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and earn interest at market rates 

table of contents in  our operating activities provided million in cash as compared to million last year 
the increase in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a million increase in net income  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in accrued income taxes 
this increase was partially offset by the increase of million in growth of receivables  decrease in growth of unearned income of million and a decrease in growth of deferred income taxes of million 
in  net cash provided by accrued income taxes increased million due to an increase in pretax income 
also in  net cash provided by accounts payable  other accrued expenses and deferred rent increased million  including a million increase in employee related accruals composed of incentive compensation accruals and accrued salary due to an increase in the number of employees within the company 
an increase in net cash used by accounts receivable and unbilled services of million in was partially offset by an increase in unearned income of million 
fluctuations in receivables and unearned income occur on a regular basis as services are performed  milestones or other billing criteria are achieved  invoices are sent to clients  and payments for outstanding accounts receivable are collected from clients 
such activity varies by individual client and contract 
in  we used million in cash related to investing activities 
we used cash for investing activities to purchase available for sale investments of million  make capital expenditures of million and purchase investments of million 
we generated cash in our investing activities through maturities and sales of available for sale investments of million  the sale of our syrrx preferred stock for million and the sale of property and equipment of million  primarily consisting of the sale of a tract of land to the city of wilmington for million 
our capital expenditures in primarily related to the purchase of a corporate aircraft for million  construction costs associated with our new corporate headquarters building of million  purchases of computer software and hardware for million and the purchase of additional scientific equipment for our phase i and laboratory units of million 
we expect our capital expenditures in will range from million to million 
in addition to the million expected to be spent in for the ongoing construction of our new headquarters building and the related parking facility in wilmington  north carolina and million to complete the construction of our new building in scotland  the majority of the remaining forecasted capital expenditures is related to up fit costs for facilities of approximately million  information technology related expenditures and additional laboratory equipment 
in  we used million in cash related to financing activities 
we paid million in dividends and repaid million on capital lease obligations and million on long term debt 
we generated million in net proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility

these increases were partially offset by the increase in accrued income taxes due to higher pretax income  an increase in other accrued expenses and an increase in unearned income 
the number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  also known as dso  improved to days for the year ended december  from days for the year ended december  dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable and unbilled services less unearned income by average daily gross revenue for the applicable period 
over the past three years  our dso has fluctuated between days and days 
the improvement in dso in as compared to was due to a combination of improved contract terms and accounts receivable collection 
we expect dso will fluctuate in the future depending on contract terms  the mix of contracts performed within a quarter  the level of investigator advances and unearned income  and our success in collecting receivables 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees in the united kingdom 
this pension plan was closed to new participants as of december  the projected benefit obligation for the benefit plan at december  and december   as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  was million and million  respectively  and the value of the plan assets was million and million  respectively 
as a result  the plan was under funded by million in and by million in  net of december contributions of million and million for and  respectively 
it is likely that the amount of our contributions to the plan could increase in future years 
the amount of contributions to the plan for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
we expect the pension cost to be recognized in our financial statements will decrease slightly from the million in to approximately million in the expense to be recognized in future periods could increase depending upon the change in the fair market value of the plan assets and changes in the projected benefit obligation 

table of contents a decrease in the market value of plan assets and or declines in interest rates are likely to cause the amount of the under funded status to increase 
after completion of the actuarial valuations in  we could be required to record an additional reduction to shareholders equity 
in connection with the plan  we recorded a reduction to shareholders equity in of million and an increase to shareholders equity of million in given the impact that the discount rate and stock market performance have on the projected benefit obligation and market value of plan assets  future changes in either one of these factors could significantly reduce or increase the amount of our pension plan under funding 
in july  we renewed our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  n 
a 
indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios and restrictions on certain types of transactions 
this revolving credit facility does not expressly restrict or limit the payment of dividends  and we do not expect any of the covenants to affect our ability to pay dividends under our cash dividend policy for the foreseeable future 
outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual fluctuating rate equal to the one month london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin of 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had borrowed million under this credit facility to finance the construction of our new headquarters facility  and approximately million was available for borrowing  giving effect to a reduction in availability of million for outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance will be due 
in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 classification of short term obligations expected to be refinanced  we classified the borrowings as long term because we recently refinanced these borrowings through a new construction loan facility with a long term maturity as discussed below 
in february  we entered into an million construction loan facility with bank of america  na this new construction loan facility is in addition to the million revolving credit facility discussed above 
indebtedness under the construction loan facility is unsecured and is subject to the same covenants as the revolving credit facility and additional covenants commonly used in construction loan agreements 
in addition  we must maintain at least million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments while the loan is outstanding 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to finance the construction of our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in wilmington  north carolina and will bear interest at an annual fluctuating rate equal to the one month libor plus a margin of 
interest on amounts borrowed under this construction loan facility is payable quarterly 
this credit facility has a term of two years and will mature in february  at which time the entire principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due 
as of february   we had borrowed a total of approximately million under this facility 
these loan proceeds were used to repay all funds borrowed under the million revolving line of credit 
on october   our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend for our shareholders in the amount of  as adjusted to give effect to our february two for one stock split  on each outstanding share of common stock 
our board of directors also adopted an annual cash dividend policy under which we intend to pay an aggregate annual cash dividend of on each outstanding share of common stock  payable quarterly at the rate of per share  as adjusted to give effect to our february two for one stock split 
we paid the first quarterly cash dividend under our annual dividend policy in the fourth quarter of the annual cash dividend policy and the payment of future quarterly cash dividends under that policy are not guaranteed and are subject to the discretion of and continuing determination by our board of directors that the policy remains in the best interests of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws 
in august  we amended our september royalty stream purchase agreement with accentia 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we agreed to provide specified clinical development services to accentia in connection with two pivotal phase iii trials for sinunase for the treatment of chronic sinusitis 
in exchange for providing these services  accentia agreed to pay us a royalty equal to of the net sales of specified sinunase products if approved for sale by the fda 
under the terms of the amended agreement  our obligation to provide clinical development services expired on december  and we are in discussions with accentia regarding a further amendment to this agreement

in november  we entered into an agreement with syrrx  inc to jointly develop and commercialize human dipeptidyl peptidase iv  or dpp  inhibitors for the treatment of type diabetes and other major human diseases 
in march  takeda pharmaceutical company limited acquired of the equity of syrrx  which is now known as takeda san diego 
we owned million in preferred stock of syrrx  for which takeda paid us million in april in accordance with syrrx s certificate of incorporation 
in july  we entered into an agreement with takeda san diego under which it acquired the development and commercialization rights to all dpp inhibitors previously granted to us under the collaboration agreement between ppd and syrrx 
under the new agreement  takeda san diego paid us a million up front payment in the third quarter of and assumed the responsibility for the development and commercialization of the dpp inhibitors and future costs associated with those activities 
takeda commenced phase iii trials on the lead dpp candidate in january and we will be entitled to receive a million milestone payment upon the dosing of the twentieth patient in the phase iii studies 
we will also be entitled to receive additional potential milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million upon the occurrence of specified clinical and regulatory milestones  and if a dpp product is ever approved for sale  royalties on net sales of any such product as well as sales based milestones up to an aggregate of million upon the achievement of specified sales thresholds 
in april  we made an equity investment in chemokine therapeutics corp 
in connection with this investment  chemokine granted us an exclusive option to license a proprietary peptide 
we are waiting for the results of additional phase i studies to determine if we will exercise this option 
if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay a one time license fee of million plus the costs for future development work on the peptide 
chemokine also granted us the right of first refusal to negotiate a license to other peptides 
in november  we became a limited partner in a

in january  we acquired approximately acres of property located in downtown wilmington  north carolina  on which we are constructing a new headquarters building 
the new facility will be approximately  square feet and is expected to be completed in early at that time  we will begin consolidating our wilmington operations into the new building 
the total cost for the construction and up fit of the new building is expected to be approximately million 
in addition  we are constructing a parking facility on an adjacent tract of land that will serve this new building and will cost approximately million 
the purchase price for the land for the building and the related parking facility was approximately million 
in connection with the sale of the acre tract  the seller  almont shipping company  refinanced existing liens on the property with the proceeds of an million loan from bank of america  na this loan will mature in march and is secured by a lien on substantially all of almont s assets  including an approximately acre tract of land adjacent to our acre tract 
this loan is also secured by a guarantee from us 
in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 we have recorded a liability in the amount of million for the estimated fair value of the obligation we have assumed under this guarantee 
almont is actively negotiating the sale of the acre tract to a potential third 
table of contents party developer 
almont s obligation to reimburse us in the event we are required to pay any sums to bank of america under the guarantee is also secured by a lien on substantially all of almont s assets 
as a part of this transaction  almont granted us an option to purchase all or a portion of the acre tract at an agreed upon price per acre 
the option will expire on january  in march  we entered into a new lease for additional space in austin  texas for our phase ii through iv operations 
the additional space is adjacent to our new phase i clinic 
to induce us to enter into the lease for additional space  the landlord agreed to deposit million in an escrow account to be used to reimburse us for the rent and other expenses paid by us under the lease for our existing facilities after july  and the costs and expense to sublease those facilities 
we account for the million to be received from the escrow account as a lease incentive that will be recognized in income over the life of the ten year term of the new lease for the additional space 
as of december   the escrow account balance was million  million of which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million of which is included in other assets 
we submitted the first request for distribution of funds from the escrow account in the second half of and the other party objected to the distribution of any funds to us 
we are currently in litigation over the escrow agreement 
the american jobs creation act of provided for a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer 
prior to  we had not previously recorded a us tax liability on these earnings because we intended to permanently reinvest them in our foreign operations 
as a result of this one time opportunity  we repatriated million of earnings in the form of dividends from our foreign affiliates in we recorded tax expense of million related to the payment of these dividends 
the total foreign tax credit related to these dividends was million 
of these credits  million will be used to offset tax in  leaving a foreign tax credit of million to carryforward to future tax years 
as of december   we had liabilities of million for certain unsettled matters in connection with tax positions taken on our tax returns  including interpretations of applicable income tax laws and regulations 
a reserve is established when  despite management s belief that our tax returns reflect the proper treatment of all matters  the treatment of certain tax matters is likely to be challenged 
significant judgment is required to evaluate and adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
further  a number of years may lapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  management believes that the reserves of million reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
we believe it is unlikely that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
under most of our agreements for development services  we agree to indemnify and defend the sponsor against third party claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct 
any successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
we expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth  strategic acquisitions and investments 
additionally  in october  our board of directors adopted a policy to pay a quarterly cash dividend on each outstanding share of common stock 
we expect to fund these activities from existing cash  cash flow from operations and  if necessary or appropriate  borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and dividends for the next months 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions  investments and other growth opportunities that might require additional external financing  and we might seek funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next months  our sources of liquidity and ability to pay dividends could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  compliance with regulations  international risks  personal injury claims  environmental or intellectual property claims  as well as other factors described under item a

if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay a one time license fee of million and the costs for future development work on the peptide 
we also have a long term liability on our balance sheet regarding the underfunding of our uk pension plan in the amount of million 
we do not know when or if this will be funded because this liability will change based on the performance of the investments of the plan and changes in the benefit obligations 
we anticipate spending approximately million in and million in on the construction of our new headquarters building and related parking facility in wilmington  north carolina 
although we do not have a contractual obligation to complete this facility  we anticipate that the facility will be completed in early off balance sheet arrangements as part of the acquisition of surromed s assets  we agreed to guarantee repayment of up to million under a surromed bank loan with a maturity date of december  in february  the guarantee was reduced to million 
in january  we guaranteed an million loan from bank of america to almont shipping company in connection with the purchase of property from almont 
for a description of these guarantees  see liquidity and capital resources above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following are the primary areas in which management must make significant judgments in applying our accounting policies to determine our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are recorded from contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare direct costs incurred through that date to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service 
direct costs are primarily comprised of labor and overhead related to the delivery of services 
each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the percentage of completion 
we then multiply this percentage by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized 
each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and  if necessary  we adjust the total estimated costs for each project 
as the work progresses  we might decide original estimates were incorrect due to  
table of contents among other things  revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate  and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
if a contract modification is not agreed to  we could bear the risk of cost overruns 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects  resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
we might experience similar situations in the future 
changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low  future margins could be materially adversely affected  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
we accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process 
historically  the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct  but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future 
a hypothetical increase to total estimated remaining project cost by for open projects accounted for under the proportional performance method as of december  would have resulted in a cumulative reduction in revenue of approximately million 
in our discovery sciences segment  we generate revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer  and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
future potential milestone payments under various discovery contracts might never be received if the milestones are not achieved 
allowance for doubtful accounts included in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  before we do business with a new client  we perform a credit check 
we also review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes specific accounts and an estimate of other losses based on historical loss experience 
after all attempts to collect the receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to us  we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate to cover uncollectible balances 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve 
investments our investments consist of equity and debt investments in publicly traded and privately held entities 
our investments in publicly traded securities are classified as available for sale securities and recorded at their current quoted market price 
our investments in privately held entities do not have readily determinable fair values and are  therefore  recorded using the cost method of accounting 
most of our investments are in relatively early stage life sciences or biotechnology companies that do not have established products or proven technologies or material revenue  if any 
the fair value of these investments might from time to time be less than their recorded value 
we assess our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for other than temporary impairments 
for our investments in privately held entities  we must identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
in addition  any decline in the fair value of publicly traded or privately held investments must be evaluated to determine the extent and timing of recovery  if any 
if we deem the impairment to be other than temporary  the impairment of the investment must be recorded in the income statement 
this quarterly review includes an evaluation of  among other things  the market condition of the overall industry  historical and projected financial performance and market values  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
this analysis of the fair values and the extent and timing of recoveries of decreases in fair value requires significant judgment 
tax valuation allowances and tax liabilities estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from net operating losses  tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 

table of contents in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  assumptions include the amount of state  federal and international pre tax income from operations  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
based on our analysis of the above factors  we determined that a valuation allowance was required as of december  for carryforwards of foreign and state tax losses and credits 
changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  up or down  in the future 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgments and assumptions 
additionally  we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the underlying reporting units goodwill to their estimated fair value 
these tests for impairment of goodwill involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated  and are inherently subjective 
stock based compensation we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options 
accordingly  to date we have only recognized compensation expense related to our restricted stock and have not recognized any compensation expense for our stock option plans 
fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  requires disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts as if compensation expense was recognized 
for the required disclosure  sfas no 
allows the use of a fair value method to measure compensation expense 
accordingly  we adopted the use of the black scholes option pricing model to determine our compensation expense for disclosure purposes 
the model requires the use of the following assumptions an expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected term 
based on our assumptions for these factors  the weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended december  was per option 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the weighted average fair value of options 
for example  if we changed our assumption for the expected term from to years  the weighted average fair value of options granted during would have decreased by or from to  and the resulting stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effect  would have decreased by million 
pro forma diluted earnings per share under this example would not have been impacted 
beginning in  we must recognize stock based compensation expense on our income statement in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payments

fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments reporting periods beginning after december  income taxes because we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
our profits are also impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of our pretax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  our effective tax rate might vary from period to period 
inflation our long term contracts  those in excess of one year  generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
potential liability and insurance drug development services involve the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol 
this testing exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from  among other things  possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug 
many of these patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death 
we attempt to manage our risk of liability 
table of contents for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures  patient informed consent  contractual indemnification provisions with clients and insurance 
we monitor clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines 
we have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the united states and in many foreign countries and to serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of drug development services 
the contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against our own actions  such as gross negligence 
we currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include the timing and level of new business authorizations  the timing of the initiation  progress or cancellation of significant projects  the timing and amount of costs associated with r d and compound partnering collaborations  the timing of our discovery sciences segment milestone payments or other revenue  the timing of the opening of new offices  the timing of other internal expansion costs  exchange rate fluctuations between periods  our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  the mix of products and services sold in a particular period  pricing pressure in the market for our services  our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel  rapid technological change  the timing and amount of start up costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products and services  the timing and extent of new government regulations  intellectual property risks  impairment of investments or intangible assets  and the timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by our customers or regulatory authorities  and are not typically controllable by us 
because a large percentage of our operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect our quarterly operating results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly results  actual or anticipated changes in our dividend policy or other factors could affect the market price of our common stock 
these factors include ones beyond our control  such as changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in our industry  disclosures by product development partners and actions by regulatory authorities with respect to potential drug candidates  changes in pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries and the government sponsored clinical research sector and general economic conditions 
any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of our international operations 
approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states 
funds generated by each subsidiary are generally reinvested in the country where they are earned 
in  we repatriated million of undistributed earnings in the form of dividends from our foreign affiliates under the american jobs creation act of our operations in the united kingdom generated more than of our net revenue from international operations during accordingly  we are exposed to adverse movements predominately in the pound sterling and also in other foreign currencies 

table of contents the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our us or us subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the us subsidiaries are almost always denominated in us dollars 
contracts entered into by our us subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  us dollars or euros  with the majority in us dollars 
although an increase in exchange rates for the pound sterling or euro relative to the us dollar would increase net revenue from contracts denominated in these currencies  the negative impact on income from operations is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the united states 
in these cases  revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the us dollar  but the costs associated with performing these contracts  which are paid in local currency  are negatively impacted when translated into us dollars 
in january  we began engaging in hedging activities in an effort to manage our potential foreign exchange exposure 
we also have currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under contracts and the collection of customer payments against those invoices 
if a contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until payment from the customer will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the receivable 
we recognize this difference as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and report it in other income  net 
our strategy for managing foreign currency risk relies primarily on receiving payment in the same currency used to pay expenses and from time to time using foreign currency derivatives  such as forward exchange contracts 
as of december   we had open foreign exchange derivative contracts with a face amount totaling million to buy the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
the estimated fair value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio resulted in us recording in a million loss as a component of other accrued expenses 
if the us dollar had weakened an additional relative to the pound sterling and euro in  net income would have been reduced by million for the year based on revenues and the costs related to our foreign operations 
our foreign currency hedging activities could have partially offset these potential losses 
changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of foreign subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the process by which we translate each foreign subsidiary s financial results to us dollars is as follows we translate income statement accounts at average exchange rates for the period  we translate balance sheet assets and liability accounts at end of period exchange rates  and we translate equity accounts at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects shareholders equity through the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet  stated in us dollars  in balance 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
to date  cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position 
however  future translation adjustments could materially and adversely affect us 
currently  there are no material exchange controls on the payment of dividends or otherwise prohibiting the transfer of funds out of or from within any country in which we conduct operations 
although we perform services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  we have not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  new or modified exchange control restrictions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable and lines of credit 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions 
we do not expect that a change in interest rates in the future would have a material effect on our financial statements
