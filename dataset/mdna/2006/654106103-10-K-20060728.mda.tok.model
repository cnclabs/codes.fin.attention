item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail stores  independent distributors and licensees  in the united states and over countries worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories brands 
our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas deepening our relationship with consumers  delivering superior  innovative products to the marketplace  making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline and excellence  and accelerating growth through focused execution 
by executing this strategy  we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
in fiscal  we met most of these financial goals 
our revenues grew to billion  net income grew to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  an increase versus fiscal these reported results included a million charge related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling involving our converse subsidiary see note accrued liabilities in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the converse arbitration charge 
excluding this charge  our net income grew and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  a increase versus fiscal for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased basis points to primarily due to lower in line net pricing margins net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs partially offset by improvements in year over year currency hedge rates 
the decline in the gross margin percentage and the converse arbitration charge were more than offset by basis points of selling and administrative expense leverage due entirely to slowing the growth of operating overhead spending  and higher interest income resulting in a higher pre tax income margin in fiscal than in fiscal in addition  we increased free cash flow from operations and 
table of contents continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases 
our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year  we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals

the primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows lower footwear in line net pricing margins in the us  europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific regions 
the lower footwear in line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs  primarily the result of higher oil prices  additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the us  higher sales incentives in emea and asia pacific  strategies to improve consumer value in emea and japan  and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within emea and japan 
a shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins 
the factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by year over year currency hedge rate improvements  primarily for the euro 
improved gross margin percentages in our other businesses driven by improvements at converse  hurley and nike golf 
fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved basis points versus the prior year 
the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows higher gross margins in our international regions  driven primarily by our emea region 
this improvement was driven by changes in currency hedge rates  primarily the euro  partially offset by lower in line net pricing margins and a higher percentage of less profitable closeout sales non current product offerings in our emea and asia pacific regions 
the lower in line net pricing margins were due to strategies to improve consumer value 
the increased levels of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing were the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories in our emea and asia pacific regions 

table of contents higher gross margins in the us region primarily due to fewer  more profitable closeouts in footwear partially offset by increased sales discounts and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand 
improved gross margin percentages in our other businesses driven by the addition of converse acquired in the second quarter of fiscal and exeter brands group formed in the first quarter of fiscal 
both exeter brands group and the international portion of converse s business operate on a licensing model  which carries higher gross margins and lower operating expenses than the remainder of our other businesses

changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by percentage point 
in fiscal  changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by percentage point 
the growth in demand creation spending in fiscal was in line with our revenue growth 
the year over year increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events  increased spending on retail marketing programs in store marketing at our retail partners  and advertising primarily around the global world cup and winter olympics campaigns and for the global air max footwear launch 
while consolidated revenues grew in fiscal  operating overhead for fiscal increased only over fiscal as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending 
changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by percentage point 
excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the increase in operating overhead for fiscal versus fiscal was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs both increased headcount and higher compensation to support the growth of our business  including our other businesses and new nike owned retail stores

other expense  net fiscal fiscal fy vs 
fy change fiscal fy vs 
fy change in millions other expense  net fiscal compared to fiscal the significant reduction in other expense  net for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year  partially offset by the converse arbitration charge 
the fiscal hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts and are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note operating segments and related information 
in fiscal  these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most significantly in the emea region 
we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other expense  net  and the unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant component of other expense  net  of million for fiscal was foreign currency hedge losses 
the hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts 
in fiscal  foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense  net  of million 
the year over year improvement in other expense  net  for fiscal was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal in fiscal  these net foreign currency losses in other expense  net  were more than offset by favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most significantly in the emea region

a million repatriation was made during the quarter ending may  comprised of both foreign earnings for which us taxes has previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested 
accordingly  the provisions made did not have a material impact on the company s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly higher than the fiscal rate primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to repatriate million of foreign earnings during fiscal under the act 
as discussed above  because we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which us taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested  the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for fiscal futures orders worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period  which approximate current spot rates 
the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on this reported growth versus the same period last year 
slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed approximately percentage point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders 
the remaining percentage points of the increase were due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel 
the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders  and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders  including at once and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel  wholesale sales of equipment  us licensed team apparel  cole haan  converse  exeter brands group  hurley  nike bauer hockey  nike golf and retail sales across all brands

the increase in inventories reflects higher in transit inventories due primarily to growth in reported futures and other orders  and earlier product ordering compared to last year and higher inventories to support the expansion of nike owned retail stores 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased in fiscal compared to a decrease in the prior year  primarily due to the timing of payments  including earlier payments of income taxes in certain foreign locations

in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives

if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease

in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future

recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
table of contents fas 
fas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of fas are effective for our fiscal year beginning june  we have evaluated the provisions of fas and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment  fas r which  after the sec amended the compliance dates on april   is effective for our fiscal year beginning june  the new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we plan to adopt the new requirements under fas r and sab beginning in our first quarter of fiscal using the modified prospective transition method and the black scholes fair value model 
as a result of the adoption of fas r  we will recognize additional compensation expense of approximately per diluted share in fiscal the amount of expense that will be recognized is largely dependent on several variables  including the level of share based payments that will be granted during the fiscal year in addition to the assumptions used in the valuation model 
accordingly  the actual effect per diluted share could differ from this estimate 
the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options for fiscal  and using the black scholes model is presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies 
under certain conditions  stock options granted by the company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee 
the fasb clarified in fas r that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on the applicable accelerated vesting schedule  rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant 
our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period  expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement 
the sec clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of fas r  then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement 
had we been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement  we would have recognized additional stock based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of per diluted share in fiscal and per diluted share in fiscal and we usually grant the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each fiscal year 
as a result  accelerated vesting will normally result in higher expense in the first three months and lower expense in the last nine months of each fiscal year  as compared to the pro forma expense we disclosed under our current policy of expensing such options ratably over the stated vesting period 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the provisions of fin are effective for our fiscal year beginning june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fin critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our 
table of contents inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as other expense  net 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in 
table of contents the fourth fiscal quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified as other expense  net 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any impairment charges would be classified as other expense  net 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted fas have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

table of contents we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries 
we use forward contracts to hedge 
table of contents non functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the decrease in var as of may  occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of may  compared to may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 

table of contents details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below  except the interest rate swaps which are described below 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties  as discussed above 

table of contents the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 
there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal we did not issue any long term fixed rate corporate bonds during fiscal or  however  in previous years we issued a total of million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds that mature between august and october fixed interest rates on these bonds range from to 
for each of the bonds issued  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month libor plus a spread 
as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was at may  and at may  for million of the issued bonds  the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond 
these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges  so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt 
the remaining million bond matures in october whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in october accordingly  changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period 
the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net million loss at may  and a million gain at may  the change in fair value of the million interest rate swap expiring october was not material for the years ended may   and in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge  accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period 
the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may   and
