item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with certain risks related to our business and our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview the company develops  produces and markets pharmaceutical delivery products  including transdermal gels  oral fast melting tablets and reusable needle free and disposable mini needle injector systems 
in addition  the company has several products and compound formulations under development 
the company has operating facilities in the us and switzerland 
the us operation develops reusable needle free and disposable mini needle injector systems and manufactures and markets reusable needle free injection devices and related disposables 
these operations  including all manufacturing and some us administrative activities  are located in minneapolis  minnesota and are referred to as antares minnesota 
the company also has operations located in basel  switzerland  which consists of administration and facilities for the research and development of transdermal gels and oral fast melt tablet products 
the swiss operations  referred to as antares switzerland  focus on research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
antares switzerland has signed a number of license agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the application of its drug delivery systems and began generating revenue in with the recognition of license revenues 
the company s corporate offices are located in exton  pennsylvania near philadelphia 
the company operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company in the broader pharmaceutical industry 
companies in this sector generally bring technology and know how in the area of drug formulation and or delivery devices to pharmaceutical product marketers through licensing and development agreements while actively pursuing development of its own products 
the company currently views pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as primary customers 
the company has negotiated and executed licensing relationships in the growth hormone segment reusable needle free devices in europe and asia and the transdermal hormone gels segment several development programs in place worldwide  including the united states and europe 
in addition  the company continues to market reusable needle free devices for the home or alternate site administration of insulin in the us market though distributors  and has licensed its reusable needle free technology in the diabetes and obesity fields to eli lilly and company on a worldwide basis 
the company is reporting a net loss of  for the year ending december  and expects to report a net loss for the year ending december   as marketing and development costs related to bringing future generations of products to market continue 
long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the status of collaborative arrangements  the progress of research and development programs  the receipt of revenues from sales of products and the ability to control costs 
the company has not historically  and does not currently  generate enough revenue to provide the cash needed to support its operations  and has continued to operate by raising capital and issuing debt 
in order to better position the company to take advantage of potential growth opportunities and to fund future operations  the company raised additional capital in the first quarter of the company received net proceeds of approximately million in a private placement of its common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
additionally  the company issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the company believes that the combination of the equity financing and projected product sales and product development and license revenues will provide sufficient funds to support operations through at least the next year 
if the company does need additional financing and is unable to obtain such financing when needed  or obtain it on favorable terms  the company may be required to curtail development of new drug technologies  limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as the company may desire 

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and use of estimates in preparing the financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make decisions that impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
the company also enters into license arrangements that are often complex as they may involve a license  development and manufacturing components 
licensing revenue recognition requires significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  the company s performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of revenue recognition for arrangements that include multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
the company s ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for the deliverable portions of the contracts may significantly impact the time period over which revenues will be recognized 
for instance  if there is no objective fair value of undelivered elements of a contract  then the company may be required to treat a multi deliverable contract as one unit of accounting  resulting in all revenue being deferred and recognized over the entire contract period 
eitf does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
in all of the company s licensing and development contracts to this point  revenue related to up front  time based and performance based payments is being recognized over the entire contract performance period 
for major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of significant revenue amounts  at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
subsequent factors affecting the initial estimate of the effective terms of agreements could either increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
in connection with a license agreement entered into with eli lilly and company in  the company issued to lilly a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the company determined that the fair value of the warrant was  using the black scholes option pricing model 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  requires that the value of the warrants be treated as a reduction in revenue 
the fair value of the warrant was recorded to additional paid in capital and to prepaid license discount  a contra equity account 
the prepaid license discount will be reduced on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  offsetting revenue generated under the agreement 
if the company concludes that the revenues from this arrangement will not exceed the costs  part or all of the remaining prepaid license discount may be charged to operations at that time 
due to the requirement to defer significant amounts of revenue and the extended period over which the revenue will be recognized  along with the requirement to amortize the prepaid license discount and certain deferred development costs over an extended period of time  revenue recognized and cost of sales may be materially different from cash flows 

index to financial statements on an overall basis  the company s reported revenues can differ significantly from billings and or accrued billings based on terms in agreements with customers 
the table below is presented to help explain the impact of the deferral of revenue and amortization of prepaid license discount on reported revenues  and is not meant to be a substitute for accounting or presentation requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles 
product sales development fees licensing fees and milestone payments royalties billings received and or accrued per contract terms deferred billings received and or accrued deferred revenue recognized amortization of prepaid license discount total revenue as reported valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets  including patents  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the impairment analysis for patents can be very subjective as the company relies upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of these long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of each year the company updated its long range business plan 
in and the company identified certain capitalized patent costs related to products for which there were no revenues or cash flows projected in the business plan or for which there were no signed distribution or license agreements 
therefore  the company recognized an impairment charge of  and  in and  respectively  in general and administrative expenses  which represented the carrying amount net of accumulated amortization for the identified patents 
the company s estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is  in   in   in and  in and the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or a sustained significant drop in the company s stock price 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the minnesota operations to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the minnesota operations exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the minnesota operations would be allocated to all of its other assets and liabilities based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of the minnesota operations over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company s evaluation of goodwill completed during  and resulted in no impairment losses 
accounting for debt and equity instruments during the first quarter of  in connection with a restructuring of its convertible debentures  the company issued warrants to purchase common stock to the debenture holders 
in the third quarter of  the 
index to financial statements holders of the restructured debentures exchanged the remaining outstanding principal of such debentures for shares of the company s series d convertible preferred stock 
also in the third quarter of  the company s largest stockholder converted debt owed to him by the company into shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase the company s common stock 
the company also completed a private placement of its common stock and warrants in the third quarter of and first quarter of the accounting for debt and equity transactions is complex and requires the company to make certain judgments regarding the proper accounting treatment of these instruments 
the company s significant judgments related to capital transactions included the accounting for one of the convertible debentures as an extinguishment and issuance of debt instruments and the other as a troubled debt restructuring  the determination of the fair values of the convertible debentures and the warrants issued with the transactions  and the classification of the warrants as liabilities 
the company s significant judgments related to the debenture exchange transaction included the determination of the fair values of the series d convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in connection with the transaction 
significant judgments related to the private placement of common stock and warrants included the determination of the fair value of the warrants  the allocation of the proceeds between the common stock and the warrants  and the initial classification of the warrants as liabilities 
in august and september of  the company modified the warrants issued in the above noted transactions resulting in the reclassification of the warrants from debt to equity 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases in each year resulted primarily from a reduction in sales to the company s major customer  ferring 
the decrease was also partially due to the extension of revenue recognition periods of certain development and license agreements  resulting in the recognition of remaining deferred revenue over longer periods 
antares minnesota product sales include sales of reusable needle free injector devices  related parts  disposable components  and repairs 
in  and  a total of   and  devices  respectively  were sold at average prices of approximately  and  respectively 
the average price increase in is mainly due to less promotional pricing in than in the average price increase in compared to was due mainly to the effect of the weakening of the usd to the euro on the devices sold to ferring 
sales of disposable components in  and totaled   and  respectively 
the decreases in device and disposable sales in each year have been due mainly to decreases in sales to ferring 
this decrease in sales is attributable to working down of high inventory levels accumulated by ferring 
the high inventory levels were the result of four activities 
in  ferring made the decision to convert its customers to the company s most current device model  the medi jector vision the vision  from the earlier device model the choice 
as a result  device sales were higher in and due to stocking by ferring subsidiaries and the subsequent upgrading of its existing customers to the vision 
secondly  vision device stocking levels were based on previous experience with the choice device  and after documenting improved field reliability the stocking levels were reduced 
thirdly  ferring increased its purchases of devices and disposable components to build safety stock as the company transitioned from internal manufacturing and assembly to outsourcing these operations during fourthly  market expansion plans by ferring that prompted the stocking of additional product did not materialize  contributing to the overstocking condition 
the company believes that this period of inventory work down has been concluded 
development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in approximately half of the development revenue was generated from device related 
index to financial statements projects  with most of this coming from one time projects 
the remainder of the recognized development revenue in and substantially all of the recognized development revenue in and was generated under licensing and development agreements related to use of the company s proprietary atd gel technology in developing products for transdermal delivery of certain medications 
the development revenue decreased in and as the product generating a substantial portion of the development revenue moved past the primary major development stages and into clinical trial stages  which are being handled almost entirely by the licensee 
the company also generated development fees of approximately  in under a device development agreement  substantially all of which was deferred and is being recognized over the life of the associated agreement 
licensing revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in deferred revenue recognized due to an increase in the revenue recognition periods of two projects following an extension of the estimated project end dates 
the decrease in compared to was due to an increase of  in prepaid license discount amortization  partially offset by an increase in one time license fees of  and an increase of  in revenue recognized on previously deferred amounts 
royalty revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
royalty revenue has all been related to the vision reusable needle free injection device  and has been generated primarily under the license agreement with ferring dated january   described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  royalties earned have been directly related to sales of devices to ferring 
even though device sales decreased in compared to  the royalty revenue from ferring increased  which was mainly due to royalties earned under a provision in the ferring agreement triggered by the achievement of certain quality standards in these triggering events did not occur in the reduction in royalty revenue in was due to fewer device sales to ferring in as compared to cost of revenues the costs of product sales are primarily related to reusable injection devices and disposable components 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the company outsourced all assembly work previously performed in the company s minneapolis facility 
the outsourcing resulted in the elimination of excess capacity and helped stabilize product costs 
the cost of development revenue consists of labor costs  direct external costs and an allocation of certain overhead expenses based on actual costs and time spent in these revenue generating activities 
cost of development revenue as a percentage of development revenue was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was due mainly to projects having more direct external costs that were billed to customers with little or no markup 
research and development research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to development projects related to transdermal gels  including phase ii studies of anturol  and oral fast melt tablet products and consisted mainly of increases in external costs for studies and analysis work around platform validation and proof of concept work 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increases in prototyping and tooling expenses in connection with device development projects and increases in expenses for studies and analysis work related to gel development projects 
the increases were partially offset by decreased rent resulting from space reductions at both the minnesota and swiss facilities 
sales  marketing and business development sales  marketing and business development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due to increases in clinical studies related to injector devices and increases in business development activities which most 
index to financial statements directly impacted payroll  travel and professional services 
the increases in payroll and travel expenses resulted primarily from the addition of a vice president of corporate business development in february of the professional services increase was mainly due to the utilization of consultants for various sales and marketing and business development projects 
the increase in was primarily due to increases in travel and legal expenses related to business development activities and due to increased advertising and promotional activities related to the medi jector vision device in the insulin market in the third and fourth quarters of general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to decreases in legal expenses of  and professional services and investor relations expenses of  along with a decrease in patent impairment charges from  in to none in the decrease in was primarily due to decreases in patent impairment charges  payroll  professional services and investor relations expenses  partially offset by increases in travel and insurance expenses 
in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a patent impairment charge of  that was  less than the fourth quarter patent impairment charge of  the patent impairment charges were recognized in connection with certain patents related to products for which there were no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenue was included in the company s long term business plan that had been updated in the fourth quarter of each year 
the impairment charges represented the gross carrying amount net of accumulated amortization for the identified patents 
the payroll decrease was mainly due to the expiration of the employment agreement with frank pass  former ceo and director  at the end of the professional services and investor relations expenses decreased in primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of consulting services and the number of consulting agreements in compared to one agreement in particular  which was terminated in the first quarter of  accounted for an expense decrease of  from  in to  in in and a portion of the professional services and investor relations expenses were paid in common stock and warrants  resulting in non cash expenses in each year of  and  respectively 
in the company issued  shares of common stock  recognizing expense of  based on the market value of the stock on the dates the stock was issued  and issued warrants and options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock  which were recorded at a total value of  using the black scholes option pricing model 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock  recognizing expense of  based on the market value of the stock on the dates the stock was issued  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock which were recorded at a value of  using the black scholes option pricing model 
other income expense other income expense  net  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense in as compared to the net decrease in other expenses in compared to was mainly due to losses on debt extinguishments  losses on conversions of debt to equity and losses on common stock warrants of   and  respectively  that occurred in but not in in addition  interest expense in was  less than in the interest expense was mainly due to  recognized in connection with warrants originally issued to convertible debenture holders that were exercised at a discounted exercise price

this was the result of net losses of   and  in  and  respectively  adjusted by noncash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash expenses totaled  in  consisting of depreciation and amortization of  stock based compensation of  and amortization of prepaid license discount of  in noncash expenses totaled  consisting primarily of stock based compensation of  depreciation and amortization of  patent rights impairment charge of  and amortization of prepaid license discount of  in noncash expenses totaled  consisting of losses on conversions of debt to equity  common stock warrants and debt extinguishments in the amounts of   and  respectively  depreciation and amortization of  noncash interest expense of  stock based compensation expense of  patent rights impairment charge of  loss on disposal and abandonment of assets of  and amortization of prepaid license discount of  the depreciation and amortization decreases in and of  and  respectively  were due primarily to production and office equipment that became fully depreciated early in each year 
the change in operating assets and liabilities in generated cash of  this resulted mainly from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased research and development activities near the end of the year  particularly in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels  and increased accruals related to executive bonuses 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  which utilized cash of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was almost entirely due to payments made in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels 
the reduction in deferred revenue was the result of recognizing as revenue amounts that had previously been deferred  which exceeded amounts deferred during the year totaling approximately  the change in operating assets and liabilities in utilized cash of  this resulted primarily from decreases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  plus an increase in other assets of  partially offset by decreases in accounts and other receivables of  and inventory of  and an increase in accounts payable of  the decrease in deferred revenue was mainly due to the amortization of amounts deferred in prior years  partially offset by approximately  of development fees deferred during the year 
related to the development fees deferred in were deferred costs that totaled approximately  which is the primary reason other assets increased 
receivables decreased at the end of compared to mainly due to a reduction in billable development activity at the antares switzerland operations 
the decrease in inventory is mainly the result of the timing of purchases of finished goods from the third party supplier versus shipments to customers 
at the end of the company had a large amount of finished goods in inventory that was shipped to a customer in early january the increase in accounts payable in

the increase was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of  which was mainly due to license fees received in connection with new license agreements in the increase in was also due to a decrease in inventory of  that was mainly due to the outsourcing of assembly operations to a third party supplier that carries a large portion of the inventory previously carried by the company 
partially offsetting the increase in deferred revenue and decrease in inventory were decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  and an increase in accounts receivable of  the decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily the result of being more current on obligations at the end of due to the availability of funds as a result of cash raised in the private placements in july and cash received in connection with license agreements  compared to the end of when cash was not readily available 
the increase in receivables at the end of compared to was mainly due to the timing of ferring shipments from antares minnesota 
net cash provided by used in investing activities in investing activities resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  in and  investing activities resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment 
among other items  the standard requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements contain pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on net loss and net loss per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied 
the sec deferred the effective date of statement r to allow companies to implement the new standard at the beginning of calendar year the company expects to implement the new standard beginning january   and to use the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with statement r  and unvested equity awards granted prior to the effective date will continue to be accounted for in accordance with statement as they have been for purposes of pro forma disclosures  except that amounts will be recognized in the statement of operations 
the company expects recognized expense in will increase by approximately  to  as a result of the new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the swiss franc to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company s subsidiaries in switzerland are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to its swiss subsidiaries in swiss francs 
most of the company s sales and licensing fees are denominated in us dollars  thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s financial results for the years ended december   and was not material 
beginning in the company also has exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar 
the licensing agreement entered into in january with ferring  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  establishes pricing in euros for products sold under the existing supply agreement and for all royalties 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
because exposure increases as intercompany balances grow  the company will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances
