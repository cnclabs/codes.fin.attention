index to financial statements us domestic package operations compared to us domestic package revenue increased billion  or  for the year  primarily due to a increase in average daily package volume and a increase in revenue per piece 
ground volume grew  and was positively impacted by a solid us economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives 
next day air volume grew and deferred volume increased  with growth in the manufacturing  business services  telecommunications and retail sectors 
the growth in total us domestic package volume strengthened throughout the year 
ground revenue per piece increased for the year  primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in  as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products

based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was in  as compared with in additionally  an initial fuel surcharge of was applied to ups ground services in january  which fluctuates based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was in total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by million for the year  due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices  volume increases  and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above 
these fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices  as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices 
us domestic package operating profit increased million  or  for the year  and domestic operating margin increased by basis points 
operating profit increased by million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in operating expenses  which also favorably impacted the operating margin

total next day air volume up and total deferred volume down were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume  but offset by an increase in next day air package volume 
the decline in next day air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing  which was notably strong in 
index to financial statements ground revenue per piece increased for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in  but growth was adversely impacted by approximately basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products  as discussed below

this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during was  compared with the average surcharge of applied to both air and ground products in  resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of million during the year 
us domestic package operating profit increased million  or  primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously  but was somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges million in compared to million in and a million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data 
domestic operating margin declined basis points  and was impacted by the aircraft impairment and pension charges noted above  as well as the sale of our aviation technologies business unit 
during the third quarter of  we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share  which is recorded in other operating expenses within the us domestic package segment

total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by million during the year  due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 

index to financial statements export volume increased throughout the world  with strong growth in asia and europe 
asian export volume  which increased for the year  was driven by export growth from china

in the united kingdom in the third quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  international domestic volume increased 
export revenue per piece increased for the year currency adjusted  due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge  but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product 
in total  international average daily package volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million for the year  or  with an increase in the operating margin of basis points

the surcharge began to be applied only to our international express products  while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products 
these changes  along with higher fuel prices  had the effect of increasing international package revenue by million during the year 
we experienced double digit export volume growth in each region throughout the world  with the asia pacific region leading with export volume growth  including a increase in china export volume 
export volume continued to benefit from our expanding international network  such as the six additional flights to shanghai  china that were added in the fourth quarter of european export volume grew in excess of  and was positively influenced by the addition of countries to the european union during the year

export revenue per piece increased for the year currency adjusted  benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge 
in total  international average daily package volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 

index to financial statements the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million  or  for the year  million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations 
the remaining increase in operating profit was primarily due to the solid export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously  and a strong basis point increase in operating margin primarily due to better network utilization 
international operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of million in  compared to a million charge in supply chain freight operations compared to supply chain freight revenue increased billion  or  for the year 
forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by billion during the year  largely due to the acquisition of menlo worldwide forwarding in december the growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses excluding menlo worldwide forwarding was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations 
revenue increased by million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations 
overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world  as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution 
during the third quarter of  we completed our acquisition of overnite corp  now known as ups freight  which offers a variety of less than truckload ltl and truckload services to customers in north america 
overnite s results have been included in the supply chain freight reporting segment since the august  acquisition date 
overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of ups  including improvements in average daily ltl shipments and average ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business  our mail and consulting services  and our financial business  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units 
operating profit for the supply chain freight segment increased by million  or  for the year  largely due to the operating profits generated by overnite 
operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding operations  as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business

operating profit also was favorably impacted by million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in operating expenses 
compared to supply chain freight revenue increased million  or  for the year 
freight services and logistics revenue increased by during the year  with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses  as well as our logistics business 
the acquisition of menlo worldwide forwarding  which was completed in december  increased freight services and logistics revenue by million 
favorable currency fluctuations provided million of the increase in revenue for the year 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which includes our retail franchising business  our mail and consulting services  and our financial business  increased revenue by for the year  largely due to strong double digit franchise and royalty revenue growth at our retail franchising business resulting from an expanding store base 
supply chain freight operating profit increased million  or  and operating margin increased by basis points for the year  primarily due to improved results from our financial business largely due to a lower loan loss provision  and our mail services business  which was affected in by the sale of our mail technologies business unit as described in the next paragraph 
our retail franchising business also experienced profit growth  due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously 
these increases were partially offset by somewhat lower profits at our freight services and logistics operations 

index to financial statements during the second quarter of  we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by million  or per diluted share 
the gain consisted of a pre tax loss of million recorded in other operating expenses within the supply chain freight segment  and a tax benefit of million recognized in conjunction with the sale 
the tax benefit exceeded the pre tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes 
consequently  our tax basis was greater than our book basis  thus producing the tax benefit described above 
the operating results of the mail technologies unit were previously included in our supply chain freight segment  and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented 
operating expenses compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite 
operating expenses also increased million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations net of hedging activity in our international package and supply chain freight segments  and increased million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our international package segment 
compensation and benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite  as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans 
stock based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased million  or  in the year  due to a change in our management incentive awards program implemented in  described in the next paragraph  which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of fas beginning with stock based compensation awards 
during the first quarter of  we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units rsus 
the rsus granted in november under this program have a five year graded vesting period  with approximately of the total rsu award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant 
the other half of the award granted in november was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant 
previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant 
this change had the effect of lowering expense 
as a result  expense for our management incentive awards program reported in operating expenses under compensation and benefits  including the rsus  decreased million million after tax  or per diluted share compared with other operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite acquisitions  as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation 
the increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet a  diesel and unleaded gasoline  as well as higher fuel usage  but was partially mitigated with hedging gains 
the increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition  but was also influenced by volume growth in our international package business and higher fuel prices 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts partially affected by the overnite acquisition  airframe and aircraft engine maintenance 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings largely due to acquisitions  aircraft  and capitalized software 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our supply chain freight segment  which was impacted by the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition  and increased utilities expense

other operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year  largely due to a increase in fuel expense and a increase in purchased transportation  but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains 
the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency  higher fuel prices  and volume growth in our international package business 
the decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines  largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft 
the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense  but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes 
the increase in other expenses was affected by the million impairment of aircraft  engines  and parts  as well as the million pension charge discussed previously  in addition to higher advertising costs 
investment income and interest expense compared to the increase in investment income of million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short term interest rates in the united states  but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments  increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships  and an investment impairment charge on certain available for sale securities 
we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors  including the extent and duration to which a security s fair value has been less than its cost  overall economic and market conditions  and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer 
after considering these factors  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
the million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships 
compared to investment income increased by million during the year  primarily due to a million impairment charge recognized during during the first quarter of  after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets  we recognized an impairment charge of million  primarily related to our investment in s p equity portfolios 
investment income also increased in due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances  but was somewhat offset by increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships 
the million increase in interest expense during was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps  as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships 
the impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in compared to 
index to financial statements in december  we redeemed million in cash settled convertible senior notes at a price of  and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes 
the redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption  which  along with the cash settlement received on the swap  resulted in a million non operating gain recorded in results 
net income and earnings per share compared to net income for was billion  a increase from the billion achieved in  resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to in from in the increase in net income for was largely due to higher operating profit for both our us domestic and international package segments

net income in was adversely impacted by the million after tax investment impairment charge per diluted share described previously 
net income in was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of million per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the irs  a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs  and a lower effective state tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows compared with was primarily due to higher net income  but partially offset by higher pension and retirement plan fundings 
in  we funded million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to million in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in are projected to be approximately million 
in  we received a million tax refund associated with the settlement with the internal revenue service irs reached previously  primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance

the residential surcharge increased for ups ground services and for ups next day air  ups nd day air and ups day select 
these rate changes are customary  and are consistent with previous years rate increases 
additionally  in january we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by reducing by the index used to determine the fuel surcharge 
the air fuel surcharge continues to remain subject to a maximum cap of 
the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared with was primarily due to the net sales of marketable securities and short term investments to fund business acquisitions and the aforementioned benefit plan contributions

we increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to per share in from per share in  resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to billion from billion 
the declaration of 
index to financial statements dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
during  we repaid million in debt  primarily consisting of paydowns of commercial paper  scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations  and repayments of debt that was previously assumed with the acquisitions of lynx express ltd 
and overnite corp 
issuances of debt were million in  and consisted primarily of loans related to our investment in certain equity method real estate partnerships 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
sources of credit we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in the united states 
we had million outstanding under these programs as of december   with an average interest rate of 
the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies 
there were no amounts outstanding under this program as of december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring on april  and the other on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december  in august  we filed a billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states 
there was approximately million issued under this shelf registration statement at december   all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
these covenants generally require us to maintain a billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company 
these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company  and all covenant tests were satisfied as of december  commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases  capital leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  and certain other liabilities

as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future 
contingencies we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws 
in one of these cases  marlo v 
ups  which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court  plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime  and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods  and interest and attorneys fees 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of  full time supervisors 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
with the assistance of outside counsel  we have undertaken an internal investigation of certain conduct within our supply chain solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the united states 
our investigation has determined that certain conduct  which commenced prior to our subsidiary s acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of fritz companies inc  may have violated the united states foreign corrupt practices act 
our investigation also determined that a small number of former employees directed the conduct in question 
the monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial 
we have implemented numerous remediation steps  and our investigation continues 
in march we informed the sec and the department of justice of our investigation  and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues 
we do not believe that the results of this investigation  the remediation or related penalties  if any  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations  nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood 
index to financial statements of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which became amendable december  negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board 
our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which becomes amendable on november  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
these agreements run through july  market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are used in the transportation of packages 
additionally  we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products  primarily natural gas and electricity  used in our operating facilities throughout the world 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments 
index to financial statements described above was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at both december  and would be approximately million 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have certain investments in debt  auction rate  and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million at december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 

index to financial statements new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which replaces fas and supercedes apb fas r requires all share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the vesting period 
we had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the original fas  prospectively for all new stock compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to january  fas r was effective beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   the sec deferred the effective date  and as a result  we adopted fas r on january  on that date  there were no unvested stock options or other forms of employee stock compensation issued prior to january  we issue employee share based awards  under our incentive compensation plan  that are subject to specific vesting conditions  generally  the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period  the nominal vesting period  or at the date the employee retires as defined by the plan  if earlier 
for awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement  we account for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach 
under this approach  we record compensation expense over the nominal vesting period 
if the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period  any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement 
upon our adoption of fas r  we will revise our approach to apply the non substantive vesting period approach to all new share based compensation awards 
under this approach  compensation cost will be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees  or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved  if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period 
we will continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to january   and for the remaining portion of the then unvested outstanding awards 
if we had accounted for all share based compensation awards granted prior to january  under the non substantive vesting period approach  the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods 
the adoption of the non substantive vesting period approach is expected to reduce net income by an estimated million  or per diluted share  based on share based awards that we are anticipating granting in the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  eitf  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

index to financial statements contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the fair value of our goodwill 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion  of which billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment 
this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years  largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made 
because of its growth  this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies  resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments 
our annual impairment tests performed in  and resulted in no goodwill impairment 
self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time 
index to financial statements the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
we use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
pension and postretirement medical benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company s costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation financial instruments as discussed in notes    and to our consolidated financial statements  and in the market risk section of this report  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve 
index to financial statements volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had approximately billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines  million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and million of which impacted the international package segment 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing  and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines and parts  million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and million of which impacted the international package segment 
these charges are classified in the caption other expenses within other operating expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow  and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in income taxes we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions 
we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these 
index to financial statements jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events  including the impact of adjustments  if any  resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities 
we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years 
realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carry forward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based  in part  on estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established for the portion  if any  of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized 
income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate 
in this regard  we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 
during and  the resolution of tax matters with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of and million  respectively 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict 
the words believes  expects  anticipates  we see  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate  both in the united states and internationally 
our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks 
the impact of competition on a local  regional  national  and international basis 
our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations  various motor carriers  express companies  freight forwarders  air couriers and others 
our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business 
the impact of complex and stringent aviation  transportation  environmental  labor  employment and other governmental laws and regulations  and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased concerns about homeland security 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees 
such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs  and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service 
we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service 
the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

index to financial statements possible disruption of supplies  or an increase in the prices  of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors 
we require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products 
cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services
