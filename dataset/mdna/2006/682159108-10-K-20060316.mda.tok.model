item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
for example  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or prove our forward looking statements  by hindsight  to be overly optimistic or unachievable include  but are not limited to  the following actual demand for our services  our ability to attract  train  and retain qualified staffing consultants  our ability to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining temporary staffing clients  the availability of qualified temporary nurses and other qualified contract professionals  our ability to manage our growth efficiently and effectively  and continued performance of our information systems 
for a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward looking statements  see business risk factors within item a of part i 
overview in  we continued to focus on growing revenues  improving gross profit and rationalizing and leveraging our selling  general and administrative expenses  which enabled us to return to profitability in the later half of we made significant progress in further strengthening the sales force through the hiring of seasoned professionals with staffing industry experience and committing more resources to our newer services lines  local nursing  health information management  clinical research  engineering and direct hire 
after posting two years of declining revenues  we experienced significant revenue growth in both of our operating segments throughout consolidated revenues for were  up from  in consolidated gross margin improved basis points from in to in for the full year  gross profit increased to  from  in this is the first full year of organic growth since in  we will continue to work to improve our income generating capabilities through revenue growth  maintain strong gross margins and leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses in order to maximize our profitability 
seasonality demand for our staffing services historically has been lower during the first and fourth quarters as a result of fewer business days resulting from client shutdowns and the fall off of the number of contract professionals willing to work during the holidays 
as is common in the staffing industry  we run special incentive programs to keep our contract professionals  particularly nurses  working through the holidays 
demand for our staffing services usually increases in the second and third quarters of the year 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as an allowance for billing adjustments related to trade receivables based on our analysis of historical collection and adjustment experience 
we apply actual collection and adjustment percentages to the outstanding accounts receivable balances at the end of the period 
if we experience a significant change in collections or billing adjustment experience  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change by a material amount 
accrued workers compensation 
we are partially self insured for our workers compensation liability 
the workers compensation program covers all of our contract professionals and regular employees 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
to ensure that the accrued workers compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers compensation program  at the end of each fiscal quarter  we calculate our self insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data 
if historical experiences and industry trends change  the self insurance claim liability calculated could change by a material amount 
as of december   we had three separate unused letters of credit totaling  to secure our obligations for workers compensation claims with three insurance carriers 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement to collateralize these letters of credit by restricting  in cash and cash equivalents for the sole purpose of paying down the letters of credit  if necessary 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies  such as legal and workers compensation matters  requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  results of operations may be over or understated 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 
during the quarter and year ended december   the company established a valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets 
the valuation allowance has been calculated pursuant to sfas  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
such evidence includes a company s past and projected future performance  the market environment in which the company operates  the utilization of past tax credits and the length of carryback and carryforward periods of net operating losses 
in determining that a valuation allowance was required  the company placed added weight on the operating results of the past two years and projected operating losses for at the end of  the company evaluated the continued need for the valuation allowance 
although our operating results were better than expected  the prior years negative evidence outweighed the current positive evidence  and we intend to maintain the valuation allowance  as contemplated in sfas  until an appropriate level of sustained profitability is reached 
we believe that the full reversal of the valuation allowance may occur in absent a full reversal of the valuation allowance  we are projecting an estimated effective tax rate of for  which accounts for the expected utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  sfas requires that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis  rather than amortize them 
we may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires us to allocate goodwill to our various business units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value of the businesses 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business unit 
this requires the identification of any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
when this process is completed  the amount of goodwill impairment is determined 
in addition  sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment under sfas  if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of intangibles impairment of goodwill operating loss interest income  net loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the most significant revenue driver is the number of contract professionals on assignment 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and an overall percent increase in average bill rates 
in addition  conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a result of more contract professionals being converted into or hired directly as permanent employees 
continued development of the direct hire business had a favorable impact on our operating results and will remain a focus of management 
as a result of our revitalization plan launched in  we have made significant investments in hiring additional experienced sales and fulfillment personnel in all lines of business 
our year over year revenue growth is a result of both improved demand in our end markets as well as an expanded and more experienced sales and fulfillment team 
specifically  demand in our nurse travel line of business strengthened significantly 
in addition  through tighter operational execution  we have realized positive gains from improved sales and recruiting practices  management focus as well as enhanced incentive compensation programs 
we will continue to focus on the growth of our established product lines as well as our newer product lines  including health information management him  clinical research  engineering  local nursing and further development of our direct hire business 
we believe the growth of these service offerings will help support further organic growth and diversify our client base 
lab support segment revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  as well as a percent increase in average bill rates 
in addition  conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our conversion and direct hire fee revenues were higher as more contract professionals were converted into or hired directly as permanent employees 
healthcare staffing segment revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  nurse travel revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in nurse travel revenues was due  in part  to a percent increase in the average number of nurses on assignment and an increase in bill rates of percent  offset by a percent decrease in average hours worked per nurse 
the nurse travel results include an increase in revenues derived from hospitals that experienced labor disruptions for the year ended december  of  compared to the year ended december  mf a revenues increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and an increase in bill rates of percent  as well as a percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  in  we will continue to remain focused on improving our income generating capabilities through revenue growth and maintaining strong gross margins 
gross profit and gross margins 
gross profit increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to an increase in both revenues and gross margins 
gross margins increased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consolidated gross margins were positively impacted by our decision to focus the sales and fulfillment team on the development of our direct hire business 
direct hire revenues have no associated cost of services 
therefore  growth in our direct hire revenues  as well as conversion fee revenues  had a favorable impact on gross margins 
during  we also benefited from reduced workers compensation claims and the related expense 
workers compensation expense expressed as a percent of total revenues decreased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  these historically low levels of workers compensation expense are the result of fewer claims and improved claims management activities  which in turn  has resulted in a lowering of our workers compensation reserves 
lab support segment gross profit increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to an increase in both revenues and gross margins 
gross margins for the segment increased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lab support gross margins were positively impacted by a decrease in workers compensation expense as well as our decision to focus the sales and fulfillment team on the development of the direct hire business 
conversion and direct hire fee revenues have no associated cost of services 
therefore  growth in our direct hire revenues  as well as conversion fee revenues  had a favorable impact on gross margins 
the increases in gross margins were partially offset by a slight decrease in bill pay spreads as well as increased overtime pay 
healthcare staffing segment gross profit increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross margins for the segment increased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this segment includes gross profit from the nurse travel and mf a lines of business 
gross margins for the segment increased slightly  due in part to a change in the segment s service mix towards the higher gross margin lines of business 
mf a revenues increased as a percentage of segment revenues from percent to percent for the years ended december  to  respectively 
nurse travel gross margins were relatively flat at percent for the year ended december  and to percent for the year ended december  this slight increase in nurse travel gross margin was primarily attributable to lower workers compensation expense 
mf a gross margins increased slightly from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
mf a gross margins increased slightly due to higher bill pay spreads and additional conversion and direct hire fee revenues  offset by an increase in employment costs  such as background checks and drug testing 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include field operating expenses  for lab support and mf a  including staffing consultants compensation  rent  other office expenses and marketing for contract professionals 
nurse travel sg a expenses include compensation for regional sales directors  account managers and recruiters  as well as rent  other office expenses and marketing for traveling nurses 
sg a expenses also include our corporate and branch support expenses  such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel  recruiting and training expenses for field staff  marketing staff expenses  rent  expenses related to being a publicly traded company and other general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease of  in corporate expenses  offset by an increase of  in field operating expenses 
the increase in field operating expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing consultant salaries  commissions and bonuses in the period versus the period due to higher field headcount and higher revenues 
the increase in field compensation was partially offset by lower branch facility and telecommunication expenses as well as reduced marketing expenses 
in the period  corporate expenses included a net restructuring charge of  for a reduction in personnel and branch office closures versus net restructuring charges of  in the period 
excluding these items  corporate expenses decreased  due to decreases in consulting and legal services  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  business insurance  travel and entertainment expenses  information technology expenses  and lower salaries resulting from fewer corporate employees and a more streamlined senior management team 
these reductions were offset by increased incentive compensation  including non cash charges for stock based compensation to employees and the board of directors of  higher depreciation expense and increased lease expense related to computer equipment 
total sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased from percent in the period to percent in the period  primarily due to higher revenues and reductions to sg a expenses noted above 
excluding the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  we do not expect sg a expenses to increase significantly for impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
at december   we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended december  versus impairment charges of  and  recorded against goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  respectively  for the year ended december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income  net  increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting from a change in investment strategy from lower yielding tax exempt investments to other higher return short term investments 
benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes decreased from  for the year ended december   to a benefit of  for the year ended december  our effective rate was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended december   as compared with the corresponding period in  was primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill impairment of  recognized in the period as well as a valuation allowance of  that was recorded against our net deferred income tax assets and a tax refund received in related to the federal income tax return  which was greater than previously estimated 
we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets of the company in and we will continue to record the minimum state tax provision and statutory foreign taxes  as well as provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets until an appropriate level of sustained profitability is reached to support its reversal  as contemplated in sfas we believe that the full reversal of the valuation allowance may occur in absent a full reversal of our valuation allowance  we are projecting an estimated effective tax rate of for  which accounts for the expected utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards in years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment 
lab support segment revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  partially offset by a percent increase in average billing rates as well as a percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by reduced demand for our contract professionals and intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller  privately held organizations 
our conversion and direct hire fee revenues were higher as more contract professionals were converted into or hired directly as permanent employees 
healthcare staffing segment revenues decreased by  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  nurse travel revenues were up  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was due  in part  to a percent increase in nurses on assignment  as well as an increase of  in revenues derived from hospitals that experienced strikes 
this increase was offset by a percent decrease in average hours worked per nurse 
mf a revenues decreased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  partially offset by an percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues were negatively impacted by restructuring efforts in  which included headcount reductions and branch office closures 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin decreased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lab support segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in contract professionals compensation  payroll taxes and employer paid benefits  as well as an increase in workers compensation expense 
this decrease in gross margin is partially offset by an increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues  which have no associated cost of services 
healthcare staffing segment gross profit decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin for the segment decreased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in this segment is gross profit from the nurse travel and mf a lines of business  and the decrease in gross margin was due  in part  to a change in the segment s product mix  as nurse travel revenues increased as a percentage of segment revenues from percent to percent for the years ended december  to  respectively 
historically  nurse travel carries significantly lower margins than the mf a lines of business 
nurse travel gross margin increased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in workers compensation and billable expenses  partially offset by an increase in travel and housing expenses 
mf a gross margin decreased basis points from percent to percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in contract professionals compensation and payroll taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for lab support and mf a lines of business  including staffing consultants compensation  rent  other office expenses and advertising for contract professionals

the increase in field operating expenses is primarily the result of increased staffing consultant salaries  commissions and bonuses in the period versus the period  due to higher headcount approved under our revitalization plan  as well as increased marketing expenses 
corporate expenses increased as a result of higher consulting costs in the period compared to related to information technology projects  recruiting and sarbanes oxley section compliance 
additionally  corporate payroll and related expenses increased due to higher headcount at the corporate offices 
corporate expenses also increased due to write offs of assets and internally developed software and increased expenses related to telecommunications  business insurance and miscellaneous office expenses

the charge for the period includes an accrual for  related to severance costs for the reorganization of senior management   for a retirement package inclusive of legal fees of  partially offset by a net benefit of  related to adjustments for branch office re openings and closures 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from percent in the period to percent in the period  primarily due to higher operating expenses  noted above  and lower revenues in the period 
impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as part of our annual planning process in the fall of  we analyzed the long term growth expectations for our various reporting units  as well as the related operating expenses  given ongoing implementation of our revitalization plan approved in february we concluded that different growth expectations and higher operating costs  particularly related to our nurse travel and mf a reporting units  were events that could result in asset impairment 
as a result  we performed an impairment analysis of identified intangibles with definite lives pursuant to sfas and an impairment analysis of goodwill pursuant to sfas in the first step  we concluded that the carrying amount of our nurse travel asset group was not recoverable as it exceeded the asset group s expected undiscounted cash flows 
we determined the fair value of our customer relations by applying a traditional present value technique  utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows with adjustments for customer attrition and contributory asset charges 
the fair value of our contractor relations was developed using an estimated cost approach 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the carrying values of our customer relations and a component of our contractor relations were higher than the respective estimated fair values and  therefore  were impaired 
in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  of which  related to customer relations and  related to contractor relations 
we determined no additional impairment of identifiable intangible assets was warranted as of december  as part of the analysis of goodwill impairment  we applied a traditional present value technique utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows and determined that the fair value of the nurse travel and mf a reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
we then prepared a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill as of september  based on our impairment analysis  we concluded that  of recorded goodwill was impaired   related to its nurse travel unit and  related to its mf a unit 
the impairment charges related to goodwill and other identifiable intangibles with definite lives have been expensed as a non cash charge to continuing operations during the quarter ended september  at december   we performed the annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
for the year ended december   a goodwill impairment charge of  was recorded  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  versus the charge of  recorded in the period  noted above 
interest income 
interest income remained relatively flat for the year  increasing from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes increased from a benefit of  for the year ended december   to a benefit of  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the difference in our tax rate for the year ended december   as compared with the corresponding period of  was primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill impairment of  recognized in the period as compared to  recognized in the period  and a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred income tax assets in the period 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate would have been percent for this represents an increase from the percent in primarily due to benefits for higher income tax rates in nol carryback years  benefits associated with state income taxes and certain other permanent adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was  including  in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable and related payroll expenses 
although we do not have a borrowing facility in place  we believe we have the ability to enter into a borrowing facility based on market conditions at december  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during the year ended december  the significant components of the decrease include the transfer of  to restricted cash in support of our workers compensation letters of credit and capital expenditures of  offset by cash provided by operations of  proceeds from the cash surrender value of life insurance policies related to our deferred compensation plan of  the net proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of  as well as cash provided by employees stock option exercises and stock purchases of  additionally  foreign exchange rates had a negative effect on cash and cash equivalents of  cash provided by operations of  is comprised of the net loss of  adjusted for non cash charges of  and the net use of cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities of  non cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization of  the provision for doubtful accounts of  loss on fixed asset disposals of  and stock based compensation of  the net use of cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted principally of a decrease in income taxes receivable of  that included an income tax refund of  and an increase in accrued payroll of  offset by an increase in gross accounts receivable of  and a decrease in accounts payable  accrued workers compensation and other accrued expenses of  excluding the impact of the adoption of sfas r  we do not expect sg a expenses to increase significantly for we expect that the growth of our businesses may result in increased working capital needs in order to fund increases in accounts receivable and payroll related expenses 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december   which included an increase in restricted cash of  related to our workers compensation letters of credit and  in capital expenditures related to information technology projects as well as leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases 
this use of cash was offset by proceeds from the net sale of marketable securities of  as well as proceeds from the cash surrender value of life insurance policies of  associated with our deferred compensation plan 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   which consisted of the proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of common stock options 
in  we implemented peoplesoft  an enterprise wide information system for our domestic lab support and certain mf a service lines 
we incurred  and  in capital expenditures related to this project during and  respectively 
during  we plan to implement recruitmax  a new front office system  for our domestic lab support and certain mf a service lines as well as certain peoplesoft modules for our cincinnati headquarters and our foreign operations 
we expect to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures in related to peoplesoft and recruitmax software initiatives as well as other information technology projects  leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases 
on june   the board of directors authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to  shares of on assignment inc s common stock 
during the years ended december  and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock on the open market 
to date  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of  at december   we had a remaining authorization to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
commitments and contingencies we lease space for our corporate and branch offices 
the lease agreement related to our corporate office in calabasas  ca as amended in is for a seven year extension of the existing lease term from march to march we have committed to base rental payments totaling  over the term of the agreement with the last monthly payment due on march  rent expense net of sublease income for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth  on an aggregate basis  at december   the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown in thousands  net of sublease income contractual obligations thereafter total operating lease obligations in addition  we entered into a new lease agreement for a branch office in march under this agreement  we have committed to base rental payments totaling  through may for additional information about these contractual cash obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are partially self insured for workers compensation expense 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the net self insurance claim liability was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had three separate unused letters of credit totaling  to secure our obligations for workers compensation claims under three insurance carriers 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement to collateralize these letters of credit by restricting  in cash and cash equivalents for the sole purpose of paying down the letters of credit  if necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r beginning in the first fiscal quarter of under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
under the retroactive alternatives  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
since the issuance of sfas r  we have been evaluating the impact of this pronouncement 
we have decided to adopt the prospective transition method and will begin recording compensation expense for all unvested stock options in the first quarter of we will continue to record compensation expense for restricted stock awards ratably over the vesting period in accordance with sfas r  which is consistent with our accounting treatment during under apb we intend to apply valuation procedures to estimate the fair value of stock option awards that are similar to the procedures that have been used to compile the sfas pro forma disclosure in the stock based compensation section of item in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  consequently  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas for the fiscal year beginning january  management currently believes that adoption of the provisions of sfas will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into us dollars 
based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements 
our interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of our investments  which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash
