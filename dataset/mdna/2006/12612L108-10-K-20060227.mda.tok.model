item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  reinsurance  for further discussion 
cna surety s largest ceded reinsurance recoverable from an affiliate  ccc  an a rated company by am best  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  due to the nature of the reinsurance products available to the company and other sureties  reinsurers may cover principals for whom the company writes surety bonds in one year  but then exclude or provide only limited reinsurance for these same principals in subsequent years 
as a result  the company may continue to have exposure to these principals with limited or no reinsurance for bonds written during years that the company had reinsurance covering these principals 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the company retains an independent actuarial firm of national standing to perform periodic actuarial analysis of the company s loss reserves 
this analysis is based on a variety of techniques that involve detailed statistical analysis of past reporting  settlement activity  and salvage and subrogation activity  as well as claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
the independent actuarial firm annually provides actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
a table is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  that presents the activity in the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the company and is incorporated herein by reference 
this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the consolidated loss reserves reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and the reserves reported to state insurance regulatory authorities in accordance with statutory accounting practices sap as of december  dollars in thousands net reserves at end of year  gaap basis  ceded reinsurance  net of salvage and subrogation  gross reserves at end of year  gaap basis  estimated reinsurance recoverable netted against gross reserves for sap  net reserves on retroactive reinsurance assumed  net reserves at end of year  sap basis  the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for the company s estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses at the end of various calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section shows re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of management s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table is cumulative as of each december  and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 
the loss reserve development table reflects  on a pro forma basis  the reserves of the ccc surety operations and capsure since and cic since its acquisition in may of such historical development is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred under the ownership and management of cna surety or of future operating results

the company maintains an experienced and dedicated staff of in house claim specialists 
claim handling for the company s contract and large commercial account business is performed in chicago 
claims for the company s small commercial bonds and the related fidelity bonds and e o insurance are handled in sioux falls 
the disposition of claims and other claim related activity is performed in accordance with established policies  procedures and expense controls designed to minimize loss costs and maximize salvage and subrogation recoveries 
indemnity and subrogation rights exist on a significant portion of the business written  enabling the company to pursue loss recovery from the principal 
environmental claims the company does not typically bond contractors that specialize in hazardous environmental remediation work 
the company does however provide bonding programs for several accounts that have incidental environmental exposure 
in the commercial surety market  the company provides bonds to large corporations that are in the business of mining various minerals and are obligated to post reclamation bonds that guarantee that property which was disturbed during mining is returned to an acceptable condition when the mining is completed 
the company also provides court and other surety bonds for large corporations wherein the underlying action involves environmental related issues 
while no environmental responsibility is overtly provided by commercial or contract bonds  some risk of environmental exposure may exist if the surety were to assume certain rights in the completion of a defaulted project or through salvage recovery 
the company estimates its net case incurred losses on known claims of this nature to be million as of december  regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they transact business under statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance regulators 
in general  an insurer s state of domicile has principal responsibility for such regulation which is designed generally to protect policyholders rather than investors and relates to matters such as the standards of solvency which must be maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  including periodic financial and market conduct examinations  the filing of annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory basis  on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
licensed or admitted insurers generally must file with the insurance regulators of such states  or have filed on its behalf  the premium rates and bond and policy forms used within each state 
in some states  approval of such rates and forms must be received from the insurance regulators in advance of their use 
western surety is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in all states and the district of columbia and puerto rico 
surety bonding is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
usa is domiciled in texas and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
insurance regulations generally also require registration and periodic disclosure of certain information concerning ownership  financial condition  capital structure  general business operations and any material transactions or agreements by or among affiliates 
such regulation also typically restricts the ability of any one person to acquire or more  either directly or indirectly  of a company s stock without prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority 
in addition  dividends and other distributions to stockholders generally may be paid only out of unreserved and unrestricted statutory earned surplus 
such distributions may be subject to prior regulatory approval  including a review of the implications on risk based capital requirements 
a discussion of risk based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies is included in both management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  statutory financial data 
without prior regulatory approval in  cna surety s insurance subsidiaries may pay stockholder dividends of million in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   cna surety received million in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations 
these examinations are generally performed by the domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities 
during  both the south dakota department of commerce and regulation insurance division and the texas department of insurance issued their respective reports of examination for the two year period ended december  these exams were initiated in connection with an examination of the insurance subsidiaries of cnaf undertaken by the illinois department of insurance 
the examinations of western surety and surety bonding were completed on january  the examination of usa was completed on august  the matters noted in these examination reports were largely administrative in nature and are being addressed by management 
the matters noted do not have a material impact on the insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus  nor have they resulted in any fines or penalties to cna surety or any of its subsidiaries 
the examination report for western surety did address the company s exposure to the large national contractor discussed later that had previously been discussed with the regulators 
the company has agreed to provide the regulators with an ongoing update and review of this exposure 
certain states in which cna surety s insurance subsidiaries conduct their business require insurers to join a guaranty association 
guaranty associations provide protection to policyholders of insurers licensed in such states against the insolvency of those insurers 
in order to provide the associations with funds to pay certain claims under policies issued by insolvent insurers  the guaranty associations charge members assessments based on the amount of direct premiums written in that state 
such assessments were not material to cna surety s results of operations in western surety and surety bonding each qualifies as an acceptable surety for federal and other public works project bonds pursuant to us department of treasury regulations 
us treasury underwriting limitations are based on an insurer s statutory surplus 
the underwriting limitations of western surety and surety bonding  based on each insurer s statutory surplus  were million and million  respectively  for the twelve month period ended june  effective july  through june   the underwriting limitations of western surety and surety bonding are million and million  respectively 
through the surety quota share treaty between ccc and western surety company  cna surety has access to ccc and its affiliates us department of treasury underwriting limitations 
the surety quota share treaty had an original term of five years from the merger date and was renewed on october   january  and january  on substantially the same terms 
effective july  through june   the underwriting limitations of ccc and its affiliates total million 
cna surety management believes that the foregoing us treasury underwriting limitations are sufficient for the conduct of its business 
investments cna surety insurance subsidiaries investment practices must comply with insurance laws and regulations and must also comply with certain covenants under cna surety s credit facility 
generally  insurance laws and regulations prescribe the nature and quality of  and set limits on  the various types of investments that may be made by cna surety s insurance subsidiaries 
the company s investment portfolio generally is managed to maximize after tax investment return  while minimizing credit risk with investments concentrated in high quality income securities 
cna surety s portfolio is managed to provide diversification by limiting exposures to any one industry  issue or issuer  and to provide liquidity by investing in the public securities markets 
the portfolio is structured to support cna surety s insurance underwriting operations and to consider the expected duration of liabilities and short term cash needs 
an investment committee of cna surety s board of directors establishes investment policy and oversees the management of each portfolio 
a professional independent investment adviser has been engaged to assist in the management of each insurance subsidiary investment portfolio pursuant to established investment committee guidelines 
the insurance subsidiaries pay an advisory fee based on the market value of the assets under management

item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
some of the more significant risks that we face are described below 
there may be additional risks that we do not currently perceive to be significant or that we are not currently aware of that may also impact our business 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or equity 
in addition  ownership of our common stock may be subject to risks associated with the liquidity of the investment 
approximately of our common stock is owned by affiliates of cnaf 
this concentration of ownership may reduce the number of market participants willing to purchase our stock and limit the ability of a minority owner to liquidate their position 
we may determine that our loss reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and we may need to increase them 
we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims 
reserves represent our best estimate at a given accounting date 
loss reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us  generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  many of which are highly uncertain  such as estimates of claims severity  frequency of claims  inflation  claims handling  case reserving policies and procedures  underwriting and pricing policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement 
many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
if estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason  the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient 
surety losses and our results can be volatile 
in the past  our results have been adversely impacted by a relatively small number of large claims 
in addition  our results have been significantly impacted by increases in corporate default rates 
these past occurrences illustrate that our loss experience and results can be volatile 
we have a significant concentration of exposure to construction firms 
a significant portion of our business is guaranteeing the performance of construction firms 
therefore  we are exposed to the challenges that the construction industry faces 
over the recent past  the construction industry has enjoyed very strong demand for its services 
however  if the construction economy encounters difficulties  we may experience a higher frequency of claims and higher losses 
our premium writings and profitability are impacted by the availability and cost of reinsurance and our reinsurance purchasing decisions 
reinsurance coverage is an important component of our capital structure 
reinsurance allows us to meet certain regulatory restrictions that would otherwise limit the size of bonds that we write and limit the market segments in which we could compete 
in addition  reinsurance reduces the potential volatility of earnings and protects our capital by limiting the amount of loss associated with any one bond principal 
we have experienced periods where it was difficult for us to buy as much reinsurance as we desired and when reinsurance costs have risen substantially 
the availability and cost of reinsurance protection depends on a number of factors such as our loss experience  the surety industry s loss experience  the number of reinsurers willing to provide coverage  and broader economic conditions 
if sufficient reinsurance is not available or is too costly or if we purchase insufficient reinsurance  we may need to reduce our premium writings and may be susceptible to higher losses 
we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are reported as receivables in our balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the ceding of insurance does not  however  discharge our primary liability for claims 
as a result  we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
it is possible that future financial deterioration of our reinsurers could result in certain balances becoming uncollectible 
we rely upon affiliated companies that we do not control to conduct certain aspects of our business 
due to regulatory restrictions that limit the size of the bonds that our insurance subsidiaries can write  we utilize the capacity of affiliated companies to service some parts of our business 
if this capacity is no longer available to us  or no longer satisfies the regulatory requirements  we may need to stop servicing parts of our business 
rating agencies may downgrade their ratings for us or for affiliated companies that we rely on to write business 
this would adversely affect our ability to write business 
our customers often refer to the financial strength ratings assigned by am best  s p and other similar companies when they are choosing a surety company 
because we use the underwriting capacity of ccc  an affiliate  to serve larger accounts  our financial strength ratings  as well as those of ccc  factor into customers decisions 
after reporting a significant net loss in the third quarter of  our am best rating was lowered from a to a with a negative outlook 
ccc also reported a significant net loss in the third quarter of  but am best affirmed ccc s rating of a with a negative outlook 
in the second quarter of  our outlook was raised from negative to stable 
however  if our ratings or ccc s ratings are downgraded  we may experience a significant reduction in premium writings 
we face intense competition 
all aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our products and services 
insurers compete on the basis of factors including products  price  services  ratings and financial strength 
although we seek pricing that will result in what we believe are adequate returns on the capital allocated to our business  we may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices 
we compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers 
we also compete against providers of substitute products such as letters of credit in certain markets 
demand for our products is created by laws that could be changed 
we believe that the vast majority of the demand for our products results from federal  state and local laws that mandate the use of surety bonds 
if these laws are loosened or eliminated  our business would be severely impacted 
we are subject to capital adequacy requirements and  if we do not meet these requirements  regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business 
insurance companies are subject to risk based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention 
these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset  premium and reserve components of our statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory financial statements 
current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk based capital formula 
if we do not meet these minimum requirements  state regulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business 
our insurance subsidiaries  upon whom we depend for dividends and advances in order to fund our working capital needs  are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends 
we are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends  advances  loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations 
dividend payments  however  must be approved by the subsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state 
if we are restricted  by regulatory rule or otherwise  from paying or receiving inter company dividends  we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash 
as a result  we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all 
some of the credit extended to us requires ongoing compliance with conditions and limitations regarding our profitability and financial condition 
we borrow money from banks under a credit facility that requires that we meet certain tests of profitability and financial condition 
if we do not meet these tests  we may be required to repay outstanding borrowings 
if we are capable of repaying the borrowings  we may experience a reduction in capital strength that may hamper our ability to conduct business 
if we are not capable of repaying the borrowings  we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all 
our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses 
investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability 
general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the returns and the overall value of our investment portfolio and our ability to control the timing of the realization of investment income 
in addition  any defaults in the payments due to us for our investments  especially with respect to liquid corporate and municipal bonds  could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or could cause us to incur investment losses 
as a result of these factors  we may not realize an adequate return on our investments  may incur losses on sales of our investments and may be required to write down the value of our investments 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations  as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development

the adoption of this standard eliminated the company s amortization of goodwill and intangibles after december  and therefore  increased the company s reported net income by million  or cents per share  respectively  as compared to the same period in if the provisions of this standard were applied to prior periods  net income for the year ended december  would have been million or per share 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of cna surety corporation cna surety or company and its subsidiaries operating results  liquidity and capital resources  and financial condition 
the most significant risk and uncertainties impacting the operating performance and financial condition of the company are discussed in item a  risk factors of this form k 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of cna surety and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies management believes the most significant accounting policies and related disclosures for purposes of understanding the company s results of operations and financial condition pertain to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  recognition of premium revenue and the related unearned premium liability  and deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s accounting policies related to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related estimates of reinsurance recoverables  are particularly critical to an assessment of the company s financial results 
these balances are highly subjective and require management s most complex judgments because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance cna surety accrues liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae under its surety and property and casualty insurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
due to the nature of surety  which is the relationship among three parties whereby the surety guarantees the performance of the principal to a third party the obligee  the investigation of claims and the establishment of case estimates on claim files can be a complex process that can occur over a period of time depending on the type of bond s and the facts and circumstances involving the particular bond s  the claim s and the principal 
case reserves are typically established after a claim is filed and an investigation and analysis has been conducted as to the validity of the claim  the principal s response to the claim and the principal s financial viability 
to the extent it is determined that there are no bona fide defenses to the claim and the principal is unwilling or financially unable to resolve the claim  a case estimate is established on the claim file for the amount the company estimates it will have to pay to honor its obligations under the provisions of the bond s 
while the company intends to establish initial case reserve estimates that are sufficient to cover the ultimate anticipated loss on a file  some estimates need to be adjusted during the life cycle of the file as matters continue to develop 
factors that can necessitate case estimate increases or decreases are the complexity of the bond s and or underlying contract s  if additional and or unexpected claims are filed  if the financial condition of the principal or obligee changes or as claims develop and more information is discovered that was unknown and or unexpected at the time the initial case reserve estimate was established 
ultimately  claims are resolved through payment and or a determination that  based on the information available  a case reserve is no longer required 
as of any balance sheet date  not all claims have been reported and some claims may not be reported for many years 
as a result  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the following table shows the estimated liability as of december  for unpaid claims applicable to reported claims and to ibnr dollars in thousands for each sub line of business gross case loss gross ibnr loss total gross and lae reserves and lae reserves reserves contract    commercial    fidelity and other    total    the company retains an independent actuarial firm of national standing to perform periodic actuarial analysis of the company s loss reserves 
this analysis is based on a variety of techniques that involve detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting  settlement activity  and salvage and subrogation activity  as well as claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
this analysis results in both a range of reasonable loss reserve estimates as well as a point estimate of the indicated loss reserves 
surety results  especially for contract and certain commercial products like insurance program bonds  workers compensation insurance bonds and reclamation bonds  tend to be impacted by fewer  but more severe  losses 
with this type of loss experience  it is more difficult to estimate the required reserves  particularly for the most current accident years which may have few reported claims 
as a result  the range of reasonable loss reserve estimates may be broader than that associated with traditional property casualty insurance products 
the independent actuarial firm s analysis is the primary tool that management utilizes in determining its best estimate of loss reserves 
however  the carried reserve may differ from the independent actuarial firm s point estimate as a result of management s consideration of the impact of factors such as the following  especially as they relate to the current accident year current claim activity  including the frequency and severity of current claims changes in underwriting standards and business mix such as the company s efforts to reduce exposures to large commercial bonds changes in the claims handling process current economic conditions  especially corporate default rates and the condition of the construction economy management believes that the impact of the factors listed above  and others  may not be fully quantifiable through actuarial analysis 
accordingly  management may apply its judgment of the impact of these factors  and others  to its selection of the recorded loss reserves 
receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and  therefore  are also subject to uncertainty 
in addition to the factors cited above  estimates of reinsurance recoveries may prove uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
the company s consolidated balance sheet includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses of million at december  compared to estimates of million and million  respectively  at december  at december   the range of reasonable loss reserve estimates  net of reinsurance receivables  calculated by the independent actuarial firm and adopted by management was from million to million 
ranges of reasonable loss reserve estimates are not calculated for the sub lines of business 
management believes that the range calculated over total reserves provides the most meaningful information due to the importance of correlation of losses between the sub lines of business related to the impact of general economic conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate claims amounts will differ from the currently recorded amounts 
this difference could have a material effect on reported earnings and financial condition 
future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period such changes are determined to be needed 
investments management believes the company has the ability to hold all fixed income securities to maturity 
however  the company may dispose of securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  the company considers all of its fixed income securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and equity securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities are reported gross in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement 
the amortized cost of fixed income securities is determined based on cost and the cumulative effect of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in investment income 
for mortgage backed and certain asset backed securities  the company recognizes income using the effective yield method based on estimated cash flows 
all securities transactions are recorded on the trade date 
investment gains or losses realized on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
investments with an other than temporary decline in value are written down to fair value  resulting in losses that are included in realized investment gains and losses 
short term investments that generally include us treasury bills  corporate notes  money market funds and investment grade commercial paper equivalents  are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate risk  market risk and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term may materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
intangible assets cna surety s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes intangible assets of million 
this amount represents goodwill and identified intangibles with indefinite useful lives arising from the acquisition of capsure 
the company performs impairment tests of these intangible assets annually  or more frequently if certain conditions are met 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of cna surety s reporting units 
under the relevant standard  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating fair value  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
the company uses a valuation technique based on discounted cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded amount of intangible assets over the implied value of intangible assets is recorded as an impairment loss 
insurance premiums insurance premiums are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the related policies in proportion to the insurance protection provided 
premium revenues are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written  before ceded reinsurance which is shown as an asset  applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force determined on a pro rata basis 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of business  net of reinsurance commissions  are deferred and amortized as a charge to income as the related premiums are earned 
the company periodically tests that deferred acquisition costs are recoverable based on the expected profitability embedded in the reserve for unearned premium 
if the expected profitability is less than the balance of deferred acquisition costs  a charge to net income is taken and the deferred acquisition cost balance is reduced to the amount determined to be recoverable 
anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
results of operations financial measures the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses certain generally accepted accounting principles gaap and non gaap financial measures in order to provide information used by management to monitor the company s operating performance 
management utilizes various financial measures to monitor the company s insurance operations and investment portfolio 
underwriting results  which are derived from certain income statement amounts  are considered a non gaap financial measure and are used by management to monitor performance of the company s insurance operations 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored through analysis of various quantitative and qualitative factors and certain decisions related to the sale or impairment of investments produce realized gains and losses  which is also a component used in the calculation of net income and is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting results are computed as net earned premiums less net loss and loss adjustment expenses and net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
management uses underwriting results to monitor the results of its insurance operations without the impact of certain factors  including net investment income  net realized investment gains losses and interest expense 
management excludes these factors in order to analyze the direct relationship between net earned premiums and the related net loss and loss adjustment expenses along with net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
operating ratios are calculated using insurance results and are widely used by the insurance industry and regulators such as state departments of insurance and the national association of insurance commissioners for financial regulation and as a basis of comparison among companies 
the ratios discussed in the company s md a are calculated using gaap financial results and include the net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio loss ratio as well as the net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expense ratio expense ratio and combined ratio 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and expense ratios 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored by management through analyses of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities  portfolio duration  and exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk 
based on such analyses  the company may record an other than temporary impairment on an investment security in accordance with its policy  or sell a security 
such activities will produce net realized investment gains and losses 
while management uses various gaap and non gaap financial measures to monitor various aspects of the company s performance  net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure and represents a more comprehensive measure of operating performance 
management believes that its process of evaluating performance through the use of these non gaap financial measures provides a basis for enhanced understanding of its operating performance and the impact to net income as a whole 
management also believes that investors may find these widely used financial measures described above useful in interpreting the underlying trends and performance  as well as to provide visibility into the significant components of net income 
comparison of cna surety actual results for the years ended december   and analysis of net income loss the company had net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in reflects higher losses in large part due to the establishment of a million net loss reserve related to the large national contractor discussed later  partially offset by increased favorable loss development on prior accident years of million 
the higher losses were also offset by higher net earned premium  higher net investment income  and lower expenses 
the increase in compared to reflects the absence of adverse loss development of million which occurred during the third quarter of  higher net earned premium and higher net investment income  partially offset by higher expenses

in consideration for the coverage provided by the stop loss contract  the insurance subsidiaries paid to ccc an annual premium of  the cna surety insurance subsidiaries have paid ccc all required annual premiums 
as of december   the net amount billed and received under the stop loss contract was million  which included a return of million in due to a reduction of net loss ratios for years covered by the contract 
the company and ccc previously participated in a million excess of million reinsurance contract effective from january  to december  providing coverage exclusively for the one large national contractor that is excluded from the company s third party reinsurance 
the premium for this contract was million plus an additional premium of million if a loss is ceded under this contract 
the company and ccc entered into a new contract covering the large national contractor effective january  to december  on the same terms as the contract

cna surety had no reinsurance payables to ccc and cic as of december  and december  large national contractor the company has provided significant surety bond protection guaranteeing projects undertaken by the large national contract principal that is excluded from the company s third party reinsurance 
as previously described  during the second quarter of  the company and ccc executed amendments to the reinsurance treaties that provide reinsurance protection for losses associated with the large national contractor 
coverage for all losses in excess of an aggregate million is now provided under one treaty 
credit extended to the principal by affiliates of the company is described below 
cnaf credit facility commencing in  cnaf provided loans through a credit facility in order to help the large national contractor meet its liquidity needs and complete projects which had been bonded by cna surety 
in december of  the credit facility was amended to increase the maximum available loans to million from million at december  the amendment also provides that cnaf may in its sole discretion further increase the amounts available for loans under the credit facility  up to an aggregate maximum of million 
as of december  and  respectively  million including accrued interest and million had been advanced under the credit facility 
loews  through a participation agreement with cnaf  provided funds for and owned a participation of million and million of the loans outstanding as of december  and  respectively  and has agreed to a participation of one third of any additional loans which may be made above the original million credit facility limit up to the million maximum available line 
loans under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the contractor and certain of its affiliates 
in connection with the credit facility  cnaf has also guaranteed or provided collateral for letters of credit which are charged against the maximum available line and  if drawn upon  would be treated as loans under the credit facility 
as of december  and december   these guarantees and collateral obligations aggregated million 
the contractor implemented a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs and improve cash flow  and appointed a chief restructuring officer to manage execution of the plan 
in the course of addressing various expense  operational and strategic issues  however  the contractor has decided to substantially reduce the scope of its original business and to concentrate on those segments determined to be potentially profitable 
as a consequence  operating cash flow  and in turn the capacity to service debt  has been reduced below previous levels 
restructuring plans have also been extended to accommodate these circumstances 
in light of these developments  cnaf recorded an impairment charge of million pre tax million after tax for the fourth quarter of  net of the participation by loews  with respect to amounts loaned under the credit facility and future impairment charges with respect to amounts loaned under the credit facility  and an additional pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax during the first quarter of representatives from the company and cnaf met with senior management of the national contractor in june of to review their actual cash flow through that date  as well as expected future cash flow 
as a result of the discussions with the contractor and after consideration of the contractor s overall performance to date under the restructuring plan  cnaf made a decision not to provide additional liquidity to the national contractor beyond amounts currently available under the existing facility 
in addition  during the second quarter of  cnaf recorded an additional impairment charge of million pre tax million after tax to fully impair the loan 
establishment of surety loss reserve the june discussions with the large national contractor revealed significant deterioration of the contractor s operations and cash flow 
this deterioration was concentrated in an operating division of the contractor that had previously been placed into run off 
as a result of these developments  the company determined that the large national contractor will likely be unable to meet its obligations that are covered under the surety bonds 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company established a million loss reserve based on an initial estimate of loss 
in the third quarter of  the company began a re evaluation of the contractor s current restructuring efforts 
through this re evaluation that was completed in the fourth quarter  the company determined that there had been further deterioration of the contractor s actual and projected cash flows 
as a result  the company increased its gross loss reserves for this account by million in the fourth quarter of after applying expected reinsurance recoveries from ccc  the company s net incurred loss is million  which is the company s maximum exposure  net of reinsurance  on this account 
as of december   the company has paid approximately million of losses to settle outstanding bonded obligations of the contractor 
the company intends to continue to provide limited surety bonds on behalf of the contractor to support the continuing restructuring efforts 
however  existing reinsurance agreements limit the company s net loss exposure to the million that has already been recorded 
the company estimates that possible additional losses  net of indemnification and subrogation recoveries but before recoveries under reinsurance contracts to be approximately million pre tax 
the company has had discussions with its insurance regulatory authorities regarding the level of bonds provided for this principal and will continue to keep the insurance regulators informed of its ongoing gross exposure to this account 
net loss ratio the loss ratios for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the loss ratios reflect million and million of net favorable loss reserve development for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million in net unfavorable loss reserve development for the year ended december  the higher loss ratio in compared to reflects the net reserve increase of million related to the large national contractor discussed earlier  which added approximately percentage points to this ratio 
this was partially offset by increased favorable development from prior accident years and an increase in net earned premium that resulted from the reduction in the cost of the company s reinsurance program 
the improvement in the loss ratio from to is primarily due to the absence of both the adverse development on prior accident years that was recorded in and other large losses related to accident year past changes in the company s business mix and reinsurance program along with increased corporate default rates were the primary drivers of the need to substantially increase reserve levels in beginning in the late s  the company began writing more bonds for large corporate clients 
shortly thereafter  corporate default rates increased dramatically 
these exposures proved to be more volatile than the company s more traditional contract and small commercial surety products  and began resulting in a higher frequency of severe losses 
as a result  the company s reinsurers significantly increased rates  reduced the amount of coverage available to the company and excluded certain accounts from the reinsurance program 
for  the company s per principal retention increased from million to million 
although the company reduced its per principal retention to million for  these higher retentions  at a time of continuing higher frequency of severe losses  further increased the volatility of results 
reported claim activity improved dramatically in and continued at lower levels through management believes that this is a result of ongoing efforts to reduce its exposures to large corporate clients  continued underwriting discipline in its traditional contract and small commercial products and a reduction in corporate default rates 
in  the company was able to achieve favorable settlements on several large claims that resulted in claim payments that were substantially less than had been previously expected 
two of these favorable settlements were on cases that were part of the adverse loss development recorded in that is discussed below 
in one of these cases  the company s negotiating position turned out to be stronger than expected 
in the other case  the company was able to negotiate a settlement that included significant recoveries that were not previously expected 
in addition  the company was able to reduce reserves on several large open claims based on new information that emerged in the independent actuarial review conducted in confirmed that the favorable claim settlements  the lower reserves on open claims and the reduced level of new claim activity had resulted in a reserve redundancy 
accordingly  the company recorded favorable loss development of million in  primarily for accident years and the favorable loss development recorded in for prior accident years resulted from loss adjustment expense payments related to prior years that were lower than previously expected 
the adverse development on prior accident years that occurred in was directly related to a significant increase in large claim activity 
management concluded that this claim activity exceeded the assumptions regarding the frequency of severe losses used in determining the then existing reserves 
first  additional contract bond claims were received during the third quarter of on a contractor that had filed for bankruptcy in february  upon review and verification of these new claims  the existing case reserve was increased by million  net of applicable reinsurance 
second  a demand was made during the third quarter of against a million insurance program bond issued on behalf of a national trucking concern that had entered bankruptcy 
this demand was in contradiction of previous information provided by the obligee on the bond 
based on this new information  management reserved the full remaining limits on this bond which resulted in million of net adverse development after the application of available reinsurance 
third  claims were also received in the third quarter of on worker s compensation self insurance bonds written between and on behalf of two principals 
after verifying coverage and obtaining supporting actuarial information on the underlying workers compensation claims  the company increased the case reserves on these bonds by million  net of applicable reinsurance 
fourth  after receiving a demand on another insurance program bond in the third quarter of  management identified an outstanding insurance program bond written on behalf of a contractor now in bankruptcy 
based on recent experience with this type of bond  which typically has few defenses available to the surety  and in particular with the obligee on this bond  management recorded a loss provision on this bond of million 
finally  management determined that the case reserve on a particular claim was insufficient due to the amount of legal fees that the company was incurring on the case 
based on their estimate of future legal expenses  management increased the reserve on this bond by million 
in addition to the net unfavorable loss reserve development  the higher net loss ratio in primarily relates to net reserve additions of approximately million for the accident year due to material adverse loss severity on the company s branch commercial and contract business 
the net additions to reserves for the accident year resulted from three large contract bond claims totaling million incurred in  an approximately million net loss on an insurance program bond for a now bankrupt large commercial account  and changes in estimates of large losses resulting from this significant adverse claim activity 
the surety business assumed from ccc and cic is subject to the stop loss contract between ccc and the company that limits the company s accident year net loss ratio on this business to for accident years october  to december    and the company recorded a reduction in estimated recoveries from ccc of million in  and estimated reinsurance recoveries from ccc of in  million in  million in and million in under this contract 
as of december   there were no unpaid balances related to amounts due under the stop loss contract 
on january   cna surety settled litigation brought by jp morgan chase co 
chase in connection with three surety bonds issued on behalf of enron corporation enron subsidiaries 
the penal sums of the three bonds totaled approximately million 
the company paid chase approximately million and assigned its recovery rights in the enron bankruptcy to chase in exchange for a full release of its obligations under the bonds 
the company has no other exposure related to the enron corporation 
cna surety s net loss related to the settlement  after anticipated recoveries under excess of loss reinsurance treaties  was previously fully reserved 
immediately upon execution of the settlement documents  the company sent written notice for reimbursement to its reinsurers 
as of december   the company billed a total of million to its reinsurers 
all nine reinsurers responsible for payment of the treaty proceeds either have paid their portions of the claim or paid the company to commute the entire reinsurance treaty under which the enron claim was made 
exposure management as the foregoing results indicate  the company s business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment and corporate credit conditions 
in response to these risks and uncertainties  the company has enacted various exposure management initiatives  particularly to reduce its risks on large commercial accounts 
as the following table depicts  the company has reduced its exposure  before the effects of reinsurance  by in on large commercial accounts  which are defined as accounts with exposures in excess of million number of accounts as of december total exposure  as of december  commercial account exposure reduction dollars in millions million and larger to million to million to million total   with respect to contract surety  the company s portfolio is predominantly comprised of contractors with bonded backlog of less than million 
bonded backlog is a measure of the company s exposure in the event of default before indemnification  salvage and subrogation recoveries 
the company does have a number of accounts with higher bonded backlogs 
for example  the company has accounts each with a bonded backlog in excess of million 
the company manages its exposure to any one contract credit and aggressively looks for co surety  shared accounts and other means to support or reduce larger exposures 
reinsurance  indemnification and subrogation rights  including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default  exist that substantially reduce cna surety s exposure to loss 
expense ratio the expense ratio decreased to for as compared to for the decrease in the expense ratio for primarily reflects higher net earned premium resulting from lower reinsurance costs  the impacts of cost reduction initiatives that began in the first quarter of  and the absence of expenses associated with the increased accrual for policyholder dividends discussed below 
these changes decreased the expense ratio by   and percentage points  respectively 
ceded earned premium decreased by million in as compared to operating expenses decreased for primarily due to the impacts of cost reduction initiatives that began in the first quarter of and the absence of expenses associated with the increased accrual for policyholder dividends 
the expense ratio increased to for as compared to for the increase in the expense ratio for primarily reflects the impact of higher reinsurance costs on net earned premiums and higher operating expenses 
ceded earned premium increased by million in  primarily due to the company s decision to reduce its per principal retention from million in to million in the higher ceded earned premium increased the expense ratio by percentage points 
operating expenses increased for primarily due to a increase in gross earned premium 
operating expenses were impacted by a million increase to the accrual for policyholder dividends 
this increase added approximately percentage points to the expense ratio 
the company streamlined its field office structure during in order to add consistency to operations and to reduce expenses 
no significant expense impact occurred in due to severance costs associated with this effort 
investment income for  net investment income was million compared to net investment income for and of million and million  respectively 
the annualized pre tax yield was  and for  and  respectively 
the annualized after tax yield was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in investment income for is attributable to higher overall invested assets resulting primarily from significant cash flow from operations 
realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the net realized investment gains in resulted primarily from the company s sale of its interest in de montfort group  ltd in the first quarter of the net realized investment gains realized in and resulted from opportunities to sell securities that the company believed would maximize the total return on its portfolio 
the following summarizes net realized investment gains for the years ended december    and years ended december gross realized investment gains    gross realized investment losses net realized investment gains    interest expense interest expense increased million  or  for compared to  primarily due to higher interest rates on debt outstanding 
the weighted average interest rate for was compared to and for the periods ended december  and  respectively

average debt outstanding was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
income taxes the company s income tax expense was million for and million for  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the effective income tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates are primarily impacted by the company s significant investments in tax exempt securities 
the impact of tax exempt securities on taxable income was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources it is anticipated that the liquidity requirements of cna surety will be met primarily by funds generated from operations 
the principal sources of operating cash flows are premiums  investment income  recoveries under reinsurance contracts and sales and maturities of investments 
cna surety also may generate funds from additional borrowings under the credit facility described below 
the primary cash flow uses are payments for claims  operating expenses  federal income taxes and debt service  as well as dividends to cna surety stockholders 
in general  surety operations generate premium collections from customers in advance of cash outlays for claims 
premiums are invested until such time as funds are required to pay claims and claims adjusting expenses 
the company believes that total invested assets  including cash and short term investments  are sufficient in the aggregate and have suitably scheduled maturities to satisfy all policy claims and other operating liabilities  including dividend and income tax sharing payments of its insurance subsidiaries 
if cash requirements unexpectedly exceed cash inflows  the company may raise additional cash by liquidating fixed income securities ahead of their scheduled maturity 
depending on the interest rate environment at that time  the company could generate realized gains or losses that would increase or decrease net income for the period 
the extent of these gains or losses would depend on a number of factors such as the prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the duration of the assets sold  and the marketability of the assets 
the need to liquidate fixed income securities would be expected to cause a reduction in future investment income 
the company might also access available or new credit facilities to meet cash needs 
this would increase interest expense by increasing the amount of debt outstanding and potentially increasing the interest rate on previously outstanding debt

the payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries is subject to varying degrees of supervision by the insurance regulatory authorities in south dakota and texas 
in south dakota  where western surety and surety bonding are domiciled  insurance companies may only pay dividends from earned surplus excluding surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in texas  where usa is domiciled  an insurance company may only declare or pay dividends to stockholders from the insurer s earned surplus 
the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval only if such dividend or distribution together with dividends or distributions made within the preceding month period is less than  as of the end of the immediately preceding year  the greater of i of the insurer s surplus to policyholders or ii statutory net income 
in south dakota  net income includes net realized capital gains in an amount not to exceed of net unrealized capital gains 
all dividends must be reported to the appropriate insurance department prior to payment 
the dividends that may be paid without prior regulatory approval are determined by formulas established by the applicable insurance regulations  as described above 
the formulas that determine dividend capacity in the current year are dependent on  among other items  the prior year s ending statutory surplus and statutory net income

the portfolio is structured to support cna surety s insurance underwriting operations and to consider the expected duration of liabilities and short term cash needs 
in achieving these goals  assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities or regulatory  credit and tax considerations

the company follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
the company has established a watch list that is reviewed by the chief financial officer and one other executive officer on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to record an impairment loss incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors

as of december   separate securities held by the company were in an unrealized loss position 
the company believes that of these securities are in this position because of changes in interest rates 
of these securities  were rated aaa by s p and aaa by moody s 
only one of these securities was in a loss position that exceeded of its book value 
the remaining security that was in a loss position was issued by the financing subsidiary of a large domestic automaker 
the security was in a loss position of approximately of its book value and was rated below investment grade by s p and investment grade by moody s 
the company believes that the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer are strong  and expects that the unrealized loss will reverse

based on the foregoing information  the company believes there are no other than temporary impairments at december  no other than temporary impairments were recorded for or risk based capital rbc and other regulatory ratios the national association of insurance commissioners naic has promulgated rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc information is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning mechanism to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
generally  a ratio in excess of of authorized control level rbc requires no corrective actions on behalf of a company or regulators 
as of december   each of cna surety s insurance subsidiaries had a ratio that was in compliance with minimum rbc requirements 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries require capital to support premium writings 
in accordance with industry and regulatory guidelines  the net written premiums to surplus ratio of a property and casualty insurer generally should not exceed to on december   western surety and its insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million and a net written premiums to surplus ratio of to on december   cna surety had a combined statutory surplus of million and a net written premium to surplus ratio of to the company believes that each insurance company s statutory surplus is sufficient to support its current and anticipated premium levels 
the naic has also developed a rating system  the insurance regulatory information system iris  primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of all insurance companies operating within their respective states 
iris consists of twelve financial ratios that address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability 
in and  most of the ratios for western surety  usa and surety bonding were within the usual ranges as defined by the naic  except as noted 
for  the investment yield for each of the insurance companies was outside the usual range due to a concentration of short term and tax exempt investments 
this concentration of short term and tax exempt investments also caused western surety s investment yield to be outside of the usual range for also for  western surety s two year reserve development to policyholders surplus result was outside the usual range due to adverse claim development in the third quarter of impact of pending accounting standards in december of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk cna surety s investment portfolio is subject to economic losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of its financial instruments  or market risk 
interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial condition due to its significant level of investments in fixed income securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
the fair value of these interest rate sensitive instruments may also be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative value of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  income tax considerations and general market conditions 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk primarily through an asset liability matching strategy 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the targeted effective duration of the company s investment portfolio is approximately years  consistent with the expected duration of its insurance and other liabilities 
the tables below summarize the estimated effects of certain hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly across each investment category 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates selected reflect the company s expectations of the reasonably possible best or worst case scenarios over a one year period 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions that were utilized in computing fair values as of december  significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and therefore actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table
