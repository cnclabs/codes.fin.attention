item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  and other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview and summary we are a rapidly growing  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming entertainment facilities 
we own and operate five domestic casinos in nevada  louisiana and indiana 
we also own a hotel in st 
louis  missouri and have recently signed an agreement to purchase a riverboat casino near this site 
we are developing a major casino in downtown st 
louis and another major casino in st 
louis county  missouri 
we have filed a gaming license application in philadelphia 
we own a hotel casino site and have significant insurance claims related to the hotel casino we previously operated in biloxi  mississippi 
outside of the united states  we operate four small casinos in argentina  have begun construction of a small casino in the bahamas  and have filed two applications for gaming licenses in chile 
finally  we are in the process of selling our interest in the two southern california card clubs from which we have historically received lease income 
on march   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with aztar corporation to acquire all the outstanding shares of aztar for cash  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  in a transaction having a value of billion including the refinancing of aztar debt 
in the transaction  we might also refinance our existing credit agreement and senior subordinated debt 
consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions  including approval of the transaction by stockholders of aztar and receipt of certain required gaming regulatory approvals 
after completion of the acquisition  we intend to develop a comprehensive plan for aztar s acre las vegas strip tropicana site 
we estimate that the design phase of this project will require at least two years from the close of the acquisition 
when we are ready to proceed with the redevelopment  we would likely need substantial additional financing for the project  which we expect to be the largest development project we have undertaken to date 
in may  we opened l auberge du lac  our hotel casino resort in lake charles  louisiana 
in july we opened our replacement casino in neuquen  our principal casino magic argentina property 
in september  we 
table of contents completed the acquisition of the embassy suites st 
louis downtown  a suite hotel adjacent to our st 
louis city project  for approximately million 
in september  we broke ground on the million st 
louis city project  which is scheduled to open in the third quarter of  and in november began site development work for our million st 
louis county project  which is scheduled to open in approximately one year after the opening of the city project 
we have also begun construction of our million small casino in great exuma  bahamas 
in late december  we filed for one of two slots only casino licenses in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we were one of five applicants 
according to the pennsylvania gaming control board  gaming licenses could be issued by december if selected  we intend to build a casino that would include  slot machines  multiple bars and restaurants  and other amenities 
we estimate this initial phase  including land and pennsylvania s million initial gaming license fee  will cost between million and million 
earlier in  we submitted bids for two casino licenses in chile  a million planned casino in antofagasta and a million planned casino in rancagua 
we anticipate a determination regarding the licenses by chilean authorities in mid our biloxi  mississippi property was severely damaged as a result of hurricane katrina and has remained closed since late august we intend to file an insurance claim for both property damage and business interruption in relation to our casino magic biloxi property 
we believe our aggregate million of property insurance is sufficient to cover the reconstruction of the biloxi facility and cover its business interruption claims 
as of february   we had received a total of million towards the insurance claims 
we are evaluating whether to build a replacement biloxi facility 
we will base our decision on management s forecasted profitability of a new facility  taking into consideration the competitive  regulatory and infrastructure conditions  among other factors 
on december   we executed a million amended and restated senior secured credit facility  replacing our then existing million facility 
the new credit facility consists of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan  of which million was drawn immediately and million of which can be drawn on a delayed basis 
at year end  some million of the revolving credit facility was undrawn 
under our existing debt structure  until the company meets the consolidated coverage ratio as defined in its senior subordinated note indentures  additional borrowings are limited under the most restrictive indenture to not more than approximately million except under certain circumstances  such as using such additional funding to repay other debt 
in connection with the aztar acquisition  we plan to refinance our existing bank financing  and may also refinance our existing senior subordinated debt 
in early  we completed the issuance of million newly issued common shares including the over allotment shares  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after underwriters fees and expenses 
also in early  we announced plans for the expansion of three of our existing casino properties a guestroom hotel at boomtown new orleans for approximately million  a guestroom hotel expansion at belterra casino resort for approximately million and a guestroom expansion at l auberge du lac for approximately million 
we are in the process of selling our leasehold interest  among other things  in the hollywood park casino card club for approximately million in cash and our crystal park card club casino for approximately million in cash 
we anticipate both transactions will close in mid management believes the outlook for the gaming industry is positive and that we can benefit from its potential growth 
management believes that the growth prospects for the company are very positive  that we have the financial resources and access to the capital markets to achieve our goals  and that we have the management expertise to execute our plans 
there is no certainty  however  that this will be the case

comparisons of the years ended december   and the following commentary reflects our results in accordance with several gaap measures 
an additional  supplemental analysis of our results using ebitda  including our definition of ebitda and a reconciliation of such ebitda to gaap accounting measures is provided in the other supplemental data section below 
operating results hurricanes katrina and rita on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast of the united states  hitting shore near biloxi  mississippi  destroying our casino barge and causing severe damage to the hotel structure at our casino magic biloxi property and some damage to our boomtown new orleans facility 
our boomtown new orleans property reopened on september after closing on august  while our biloxi property remains closed 
on september  hurricane rita passed almost directly over lake charles and caused damage to l auberge du lac  which casino partially reopened on october after closing on september by the end of october  all amenities  including the golf course  had been reopened 
we continue to prepare our property damage and business interruption insurance claims associated with the storms 
as of year end  we recorded certain property damage and business interruption insurance receivables for damage to the facility and expenses incurred  however  we have not recorded any lost profit business interruption insurance as of december see casino magic biloxi below 
at our new orleans and lake charles facilities  besides the hurricane closure periods  we expensed hurricane related costs of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have not yet determined whether we will file insurance claims for either facility  as we have not yet determined whether our costs will exceed the property specific deductibles 
we did not record any lost profit recovery at either property 
both storms caused significant damage to the communities in and along the path of each hurricane  affected other communities that housed and supported the many evacuees  including the bossier city shreveport  dallas and houston areas  and resulted in an overall distraction to many potential customers during and after the storms 
overall  the operating results of our company have been affected  both positively and negatively  from these natural disasters 
discontinued operations in december  we elected to pursue the sale of our two card clubs in southern california  including executing an agreement for the sale of the crystal park facility in december and reaching a non binding agreement in principle for the sale of our interests in the hollywood park casino 
accordingly  the results of operations table and the discussion of financial results reflect such card club assets and related liabilities as held for sale and the operations as discontinued 
revenues increased to  in from  in  primarily from the may opening of l auberge du lac and record results at boomtown new orleans  and despite the closure of our biloxi 
table of contents property since late august 
gaming revenues represented the majority of the increase  or  while food and beverage and hotel increased by  and  respectively  over the comparable period 
other income comprised primarily of retail  arcade and showroom revenue increased by  when compared to primarily due to the opening of such amenities at l auberge du lac 
revenues in exceeded revenues of  primarily due to belterra casino resort s improved results from the completion of the hotel expansion in may operating income for was  net of pre opening and development costs of  compared to  in  which year includes a gain on the sale of assets  net of other items  of  partially off set by pre opening and development costs of  operating income was  in  which includes an asset impairment charge of  and other unusual items with a net benefit of  for a listing of these and other non routine items  see notes g and h to item above 
each property s contribution to these results is as follows as noted above  our boomtown new orleans property reopened on september and has since benefited from reduced competition and the sizable rebuilding effort that has begun in the new orleans area 
consequently  boomtown new orleans achieved revenue and operating income records in revenues grew by  or  to  compared to  in  primarily from an increase in gaming revenue of  due to limited housing in the greater new orleans area and the permanent departure of a number of our new orleans employees  and despite paying increased wages  our labor costs in the fourth quarter were below historical levels 
hence  benefiting from the fourth quarter increased revenue and reduced labor costs  despite expensing approximately million of hurricane related costs  operating income for was  an increase from  in the operating margin in increased to from in such increased operating income is expected to decline as competing casinos in new orleans and the gulf coast reopen  including the large land based casino in downtown new orleans that re opened in mid february revenues in grew to  from  in  primarily due to gaming revenue improvement 
operating income grew to  in the year from  in the prior year  a percentage point increase in the operating margin 
in  our belterra casino resort facility benefited from a full year of the may opening of its guestroom tower addition bringing the total to guestrooms 
in addition  in june  belterra opened its new poker room  increasing the total number of gaming positions by according to the indiana gaming commission  the southern indiana gaming market produced a  or  increase in gaming revenues in compared to belterra s revenues for increased by  or  to  from  in  primarily from gaming revenues 
benefiting from controlled labor and marketing costs and economies of scale  operating income in grew by  or  to  from the prior year period of  for the year  the operating margin increased three percentage points over for  revenues at belterra grew by  or  to  from  in  primarily from gaming revenue growth from the may completion of the million guestroom expansion project 
operating income in also grew substantially  improving by  or  to  from  in 
table of contents on may   we opened l auberge du lac  which we believe is the premier hotel casino in southeastern louisiana 
located on acres of land  l auberge du lac offers guestrooms and suites  several restaurants  approximately  square feet of meeting space  a championship golf course designed by tom fazio  retail shops and a full service spa 
unlike most other riverboat casinos  most of the public areas at l auberge du lac  and in particular the casino  are situated entirely on one level 
the casino is surrounded on three sides by the hotel facility and other guest amenities  providing convenient access to the approximately  slot machines and table games 
as noted above  l auberge du lac reopened its casino on october after closing on september due to hurricane rita 
while the facility was closed  l auberge du lac housed hundreds of reconstruction and security personnel and served more than  meals 
overall  the property expensed approximately million of costs associated with the hurricane  including asset write offs  repair costs  labor and other expenses during the closure period 
as noted above  we have not recorded any potential lost profit insurance proceeds 
revenues for were  expenses in of  include hurricane related costs of  pre opening and development costs of  and depreciation charges of  consistent with opening a hotel casino in a highly competitive market  we also incurred significant marketing and promotional costs 
we anticipate such costs declining in the future 
generally  the cost to retain customers is less expensive than attracting new customers 
pre opening and development costs in and were  and the bossier city shreveport gaming market continued to be highly competitive in  as reflected in our boomtown bossier city results 
revenues for the year were  compared to  in the majority of the decline was table game revenue 
in  native american gaming facilities opened in oklahoma  including a facility approximately one hour from the dallas fort worth area 
beginning in the first quarter  such properties were also permitted to operate table games 
operating income for was  compared to  in  as the decline in revenue was not fully offset by labor and other operating efficiencies 
hurricanes katrina and rita were also factors  as evacuees from new orleans and the gulf coast occupied many of the facility s guestrooms and understandably did not gamble as much as the hotel s usual clientele 
in  boomtown bossier city benefited from operating efficiencies related to its labor and marketing costs  as it was able to improve its operating income to  from  as noted above  the expansion of native american gaming in oklahoma has adversely affected the bossier city shreveport market 
boomtown bossier city s revenues were  compared to revenues of  revenues at our boomtown reno property increased to  in compared to  in  primarily from truck stop service station revenue 
during  new native american casino operations that are closer to several of boomtown reno s feeder markets opened or expanded in northern california 
we believe that the effect of this has now been substantially absorbed by the reno gaming market 
due to increasing fuel prices over a similar period  boomtown reno has experienced a shift from high margin gaming revenue to lower margin fuel revenue 
operating income for boomtown reno in was  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to reduced depreciation costs approximately  as expansions and improvements made in past years reached the end of their depreciation lives 
as discussed above  boomtown reno has approximately developable acres 
we have agreed to sell approximately acres to cabela s retail  inc  which has indicated its plans to build an outdoor sporting goods store on such land 
we continue to evaluate for future development or other uses for the remaining excess acres 

table of contents revenues for the year ended december  at boomtown reno were  compared to  for the year ended december   and operating income was  in versus  in  reflecting the mid expansion of native american gaming in california 
the operating results for casino magic argentina reflect the july opening of our replacement casino at our principle site in neuquen  which facility includes a larger  more luxurious casino  restaurant  and an entertainment venue on land owned by us approximately one mile from the former leased facility 
revenues in grew  or  to  from  in consistent with the opening of a new facility  casino magic argentina incurred pre opening costs of  as well as an increase in depreciation charges of  now that we own the building 
overall  operating income in was  compared to  in revenues and operating income in exceeded the results of  and  respectively  primarily due to the stabilized economic and political environment in argentina since the currency devaluation 
in september  we acquired the embassy suites st 
louis downtown  a suite hotel adjacent to our st 
louis city project 
revenues in were  net of depreciation charges of  operating income for was  casino magic biloxi as a result of hurricane katrina  the casino barge at casino magic biloxi was destroyed 
we are still in the process of assessing the substantial damage to the hotel structure and its contents 
at this time  we intend to file a claim for both property damage and business interruption in relation to our casino magic biloxi property 
we maintain an aggregate of million of property insurance on a per occurrence basis  including business interruption coverage 
this insurance is comprised of multiple layers of coverage underwritten by separate carriers or syndicates  all of which are currently rated a or better by a major rating agency 
the insurance provides million of coverage per occurrence for a weather catastrophe occurrence and at least million on an annual basis for flood coverage 
as of february   we have been paid million by certain insurance carriers 
a number of the insurance carriers have reserved their rights to characterize the loss as one caused  at least in part  by a flood 
such insurance carriers have further reserved their rights to assert that such flood loss would fall within the policies limited flood coverage  if any 
we have reserved all rights to sue any carrier for bad faith or any other reason in asserting our full rights under law and under our insurance policies 
we intend to vigorously oppose any effort by any of our insurance carriers to limit their obligations under the policies by improperly characterizing the losses sustained by us 
we wrote down by  the net book value of property and equipment that was impaired by the storm and a corresponding insurance receivable was recorded 
such amount has no relevance to the actual insurance claims  which are based on the cost in future periods of rebuilding a new property of like kind and quality to the property that was destroyed 
such receivable was reduced by million of insurance proceeds received through december  and by another million for receipts received through february  we also recorded a receivable for inventory write downs and expenses incurred at biloxi during and since the storm of  but not for any hurricane related lost profits 
we are insured for both the ongoing expenses and the lost profits  but accounting principles do not permit recognition of such lost profits until the ultimate resolution of such claims with the insurance carriers 
we anticipate incurring additional impairment charges and recording insurance receivables in the upcoming periods as a more detailed assessment of the remaining assets is completed 
in addition  we anticipate recording additional insurance receivables for other insured expenses as we evaluate our business interruption claim 
we are also incurring certain uninsured costs  such as certain legal 
table of contents expenses 
management expects the company s ultimate insurance claim and recovery will be significantly larger than the insurance receivables of million currently shown on our balance sheet 
due to the shortened operating year  casino magic biloxi s revenues and operating income for were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in the operating income includes approximately  of costs related to the hurricane 
for the year ended december   revenues were  compared to  in operating income improved to  in from  in  as the property increased its focus on more profitable promotional offers 
corporate costs corporate costs in were  compared to  in the additional costs are due primarily to the increased staffing costs consistent with a growing company  offset by a decline in audit related expenses 
corporate costs were  in corporate costs increased in as compared to primarily due to audit and related service costs of approximately  and additional corporate staffing and related costs of  consistent with our long term growth strategies 
other pre opening and development costs as noted above  other pre opening and development costs exclude such expenses associated with l auberge du lac and casino magic argentina  which costs are included in the respective operating income amounts discussed above 
other pre opening and development costs for were  primarily for the st 
louis projects 
in  other pre opening and development costs were  including the st 
louis opportunities and an unsuccessful gaming initiative we helped sponsor in california 
in  other pre opening and development costs were gain on sale of assets  net of other items in  we sold acres of surplus land for approximately million in cash and recorded a gain  net of transactional and other costs  of  in addition  we recorded a charge of  for the expensing of an agreement for a consultant that assisted with the disposition of the surplus land 
indiana regulatory matters in  we received funds and settled certain legal matters in connection with an investigation by the indiana gaming commission into events surrounding a golf tournament in  and therefore recorded a benefit of  in in  a benefit of  was recorded in connection with the reversal of reserves no longer deemed necessary 
goodwill and asset impairment charges during  we identified certain pre acquisition deferred tax assets related to casino magic corp  which estimated future realization had changed based on facts identified in the year 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  pre acquisition contingent tax matters  including changes in a deferred tax asset s estimated future realization  that are resolved beyond the one year post acquisition period are required to be reclassified from the deferred tax accounts to goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we included such amounts in our annual goodwill assessment 
based on the evaluation completed  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  in interest income interest income in was  compared to  in and  in with the increase in primarily attributed to higher interest rates on invested funds offset by reduced invested funds 
the improvement in versus is primarily due to an increase in invested funds from the various financings 

table of contents interest expense interest expense in before capitalized interest was  compared to  in and  in capitalized interest was   and  in  and  respectively 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in december  we entered into a new credit facility which facility reduced our overall incremental borrowing costs and provided more flexible covenants 
in early  we retired the remaining portion of our senior subordinated notes using borrowings from the then credit facility 
although advantageous to our overall capital structure  we incurred charges of  in related to unamortized debt issuance costs and similar items associated with the retired debt 
during and  we also improved our overall capital structure through various debt refinancings and consequently incurred similar charges of  and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit during  we recorded a tax benefit of  from continuing operations 
we had previously recorded a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our indiana state income tax net operating losses nols related to our belterra operations  as the ultimate utilization of such state nols was deemed uncertain 
during the third quarter  we determined it is more likely than not that we will utilize the indiana state nols based on an analysis of the deferred tax assets  the level of recent and projected performance of belterra and current indiana state tax law 
accordingly and based on our best estimates  we recorded a non cash benefit of  reversing the previously established valuation allowance 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  we recorded net federal income tax credits of approximately  relating to wage continuation payments to workers displaced by hurricanes katrina and rita 
such benefits are reflected in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  excluding such benefits  our effective income tax rate for was approximately 
our effective tax rate in was approximately  or a tax provision of  this was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non deductible california gaming initiative costs 
the effective tax rate in was  or a tax benefit of  during  we revised our estimate of tax reserves to cover certain tax exposures 
we recorded a tax provision of  in the year in connection with such activity 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge from pre tax losses and the non routine tax charge  the effective tax rate in was 
discontinued operations in december  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our two card clubs in southern california 
pursuant to california law  publicly traded companies are effectively not permitted to operate card clubs 
accordingly  we have leased these facilities to a third party operator 
in  we sponsored a voter initiative that would have permitted card clubs to offer slot machines 
the measure was heavily opposed by native american tribal casinos in california  which funded an extensive media campaign  and the measure was defeated 
we recently determined the upside of continued ownership of such leased facilities was limited and that we would prefer to focus our resources on core businesses that we can manage directly 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell the crystal park card club to an investor group for gross proceeds of million in cash 
at december   the net book value of the assets to be sold was approximately million 
such amount is primarily property and equipment and has been reclassified to assets held for sale as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the facility is leased to a third party operator  which rent has been  per annum since such lease has historically been a year to year arrangement 
in early  we reached a non binding agreement in principle to sell our leasehold interest  and assign certain related receivables  of the hollywood park casino to the owners of the hollywood park racetrack for gross proceeds of approximately million in cash plus cancellation of the existing lease obligation 
in  in connection with the sale of the hollywood park racetrack  we entered into a lease agreement that  inclusive of a year renewal period  expires in september for the hollywood park casino 
current lease obligations 
table of contents are million per annum  with an increase in the annual rent on the renewal date based on the change in consumer price index between lease inception and renewal 
we sub lease the facility to the same third party operator of our crystal park casino 
prior to  the annual sub lease rent to us was million  which lease obligation increased to million in with a commitment for us to fund approximately million of capital improvements at the card club during the year 
as with crystal park  the lease has historically been a year to year lease 
as of december   the net book value of the hollywood park casino assets to be sold and the receivables assigned was approximately million  which is also included as assets held for sale at year end on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the capital lease obligation to be cancelled in connection with the transaction of million has been reclassified to liabilities associated with assets held for sale as of december  the book value of the lease does not reflect the rent obligations that would occur if the renewal option in is exercised 
we anticipate executing an agreement for sale of our interests in the hollywood park casino shortly and completing both transactions in mid liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash  and approximately million of availability under our credit facility see detail discussion below 
we estimate that approximately million is currently used to fund our casino cages  slot machines  operating accounts and day to day working capital needs 
we generally produce significant positive cash flows from operations  though this is not reflected in our reported net income due to our large depreciation charges and other non cash costs 
our working capital current assets less current liabilities  excluding restricted cash was  at december   versus  at december  the decline was principally due to the utilization of excess cash in for construction and pre opening costs for l auberge du lac which opened in may  construction of the replacement casino in argentina that opened in july and pre opening costs for the st 
louis projects 
in addition  we utilized  for the l auberge du lac construction  funds held in a completion reserve account 
such account was required by the prior credit agreement and was classified as a long term asset and therefore not a component of working capital 
cash provided by operations was  for the year ended december   compared to  in the period 
the increase is principally due to the opening of l auberge du lac and the increased cash flow from the boomtown new orleans facility 
such improvements over were achieved despite the closure of our biloxi facility and other storm related items 
we anticipate cash flow from operations will improve further in as we benefit from a full year of operating l auberge du lac 
operating cash flow in also may benefit from business interruption insurance proceeds that we may receive during the year 
cash invested in property and equipment in was million  including approximately million for construction at l auberge du lac  million for the st 
louis projects including the purchase of land adjacent to the city project  million for the embassy suites hotel and approximately million for the replacement casino in argentina 
in and for the next few years  our anticipated capital needs may include the following we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire aztar  which operates the tropicana casino and resort in atlantic city  new jersey  the tropicana resort and casino on the strip in las vegas  nevada  as well as other casino facilities in laughlin  nevada  caruthersville  missouri  and evansville  indiana 
the acquisition will require approximately billion  including refinancing aztar s debt 
we expect the transaction to close by the end of 
table of contents after completion of the acquisition  we intend to develop a comprehensive plan for aztar s acre las vegas strip tropicana site 
we estimate that the design phase of this project will require at least two years from the close of the acquisition 
when we are ready to proceed with the redevelopment  we will likely need substantial additional financing for the project  which we expect to be the largest development project we have undertaken to date 
we have development agreements with government agencies for both of our st 
louis projects 
these require investments of at least million consisting of a million hotel and casino and million of other real estate projects for the city project and million for the county project 
in august  our board of directors approved an increase in the investment for the st 
louis city hotel and casino to approximately million and an increase in the st 
louis county project to million 
most of such amounts are expected to be invested over the next three years 
we have announced plans for million of expansion projects at three of our properties  with completion of all three planned for we have entered into a purchase agreement to potentially acquire the president casino st 
louis for approximately million 
we intend to invest approximately million for a replacement truck stop and satellite casino at boomtown reno in connection with the proposed cabela s transaction 
we anticipate investing approximately million to refurbish the embassy suites hotel 
we are currently constructing our million casino in the bahamas 
we continue to review alternatives for our biloxi facility 
we intend to continue to maintain our current properties in good condition and estimate that this will require maintenance capital spending of approximately million per year 
after the consummation of the aztar acquisition  we expect that our annual maintenance capital spending will increase substantially 
in  we generated cash from financing activities of  primarily from our bank financing activities discussed below 
in early  we completed the issuance of million newly issued common shares resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
we expect to complete the sale of our two southern california card clubs in mid and therefore generate approximately million of cash before expenses and closing costs 
such card clubs generated lease income of approximately million to us in before payment by us of million on the capital lease and reinvestment of million in capital improvements  as required under the sublease 
upon closing  we expect to cancel the long term lease obligation to the owner of the hollywood park racetrack 
we will continue to pay our lease obligation and expect to receive monthly rent from the tenant of the facilities  on a month to month basis until the sales are complete 
as of december   our debt consisted of million of term loans and million of revolver facility borrowings under the credit facility entered into in december discussed below  letters of credit of approximately million and two issues of senior subordinated indebtedness million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due march the notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due october the notes 
there are no sinking fund requirements or significant principal repayment obligations on this debt prior to maturity 
on december   we executed a million amended and restated senior secured credit facility  replacing our prior million senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan facility  of which million is currently 
table of contents outstanding and million of which can be drawn on a delayed basis through july  in addition  the revolver credit facility  effective with an amendment executed on december  provides for a sub limit for letters of credit for up to million  approximately million of which is currently outstanding 
finally  the credit facility provides for up to an aggregate amount of million in incremental loans  subject to the agreement of existing and or new lenders to provide the same 
our debt repayment obligations prior to are nominal 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of of the principal amount of the term loan outstanding on july   commencing in december we are obligated to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the credit facility from the net proceeds of certain debt offerings and certain asset sales and dispositions 
in addition  we will be required to prepay borrowings under the credit facility with a percentage of our excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility beginning with the fiscal year management does not believe such payments will be required in the foreseeable future  as the definition of excess cash flow adjusts for capital spending activities in a given year 
we have the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the credit facility at any time without premium or penalty 
interest on the credit facility is subject to change based on the floating rate index selected 
for the revolving loan facility  the interest rate margin is based on our leverage ratio  and the total interest rate was per annum over libor as of december  the term loan bore an interest rate of per annum over libor as of december  the undrawn revolver facility bore a facility fee for unborrowed amounts of per annum  which rate is also based on our leverage ratio 
the delayed draw term loan bore a commitment fee of per annum at december   which fee will increase in december to per annum for the duration of the delayed draw period 
we may also  at our option  borrow at a base rate  as defined in the agreement 
under the credit facility  at least of our debt obligations must be subject to fixed interest rates or hedge agreements or other interest rate protection agreements 
as of december   approximately of our debt was at fixed versus floating interest rates 
the credit facility has  among other things  restrictive financial covenants and capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants 
the obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and our domestic restricted subsidiaries  including a pledge of the equity interests in our domestic subsidiaries 
our obligations under the credit facility are also guaranteed by our domestic restricted subsidiaries 
we believe we are in compliance with our bank debt covenants as of december  under our most restrictive indenture  we are permitted to incur up to million of bank credit facility indebtedness or other senior indebtedness  of which approximately million was outstanding at december  additional borrowings under the credit facility may account for most or all of such permitted indebtedness 
our indenture also permits the incurrence of additional indebtedness senior or otherwise in excess of million for debt refinancing  such as the million of borrowings used to refinance our senior subordinated notes in february see note to the consolidated financial statements  or under a provision that permits additional incurrence if at the time the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred  our consolidated coverage ratio on a pro forma basis as defined in the indenture would be at least to our consolidated coverage ratio at december  was under to the credit facility provides for permitted capital expenditures for our st 
louis projects including the condominium component  the rebuilding  if we elect  of our biloxi facility and maintaining existing facilities 
in addition  the credit facility permits us to expend funds on various new capital projects such as the million of hotel expansion plans in an amount up to million inclusive of the million of proceeds generated from our early commons stock offering  which amount can be increased from certain asset sales or additional equity transactions 
in  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of notes  million of which were issued at a price of of par  thereby yielding to first call and maturity and million of which 
table of contents were issued at a price of of par  thereby yielding to the first call date to maturity 
in  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of notes  which notes were issued at of par  thereby yielding to first call and maturity 
net proceeds of these offerings were used to refinance our then existing higher coupon senior subordinated notes with maturity dates in both the and the notes are our unsecured obligations  guaranteed by all of our domestic material restricted subsidiaries  as defined in the indentures 
the indentures governing the notes and notes contain certain covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make certain distributions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  create certain liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  sell assets  issue or sell equity interests in its subsidiaries  or enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
the notes and notes become callable at a premium over their face amount on march  and october   respectively 
such premiums decline periodically as the bonds near their respective maturities 
neither series of notes has any required sinking fund or other principal payments prior to their maturities 
on december   we issued a million irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of the pennsylvania gaming control board in connection with the filing our philadelphia  pennsylvania casino proposal and filing 
in  we issued irrevocable letters of credit totaling approximately million in connection with our chilean gaming applications and million in connection with our self insured workers compensation programs 
in september  we issued a million irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of an affiliate of the city of st 
louis  which remains outstanding as of december  the letters of credit bear a facility fee of per annum as of december  in addition  at december   we maintained an additional letter of credit for workers compensation collateralized by cash of approximately million 
we currently believe that our existing cash resources  including the net proceeds from the common stock offering  cash flows from operations  cash anticipated from asset sales and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  maintain existing properties  make necessary debt service payments and fund the st 
louis and certain other expansion capital projects 
depending on the scale of the facility that we might choose and build  we also believe the anticipated proceeds associated with the insurance claim for casino magic biloxi will be sufficient to pay a substantial part of the costs to replace the facility if we choose to do so 
we believe the actual development timeline for philadelphia will be quite extended  given the many political  regulatory and construction related issues involved 
we believe  based on our successful access to the capital markets in  and recently in  that we will be able to raise necessary incremental funding to build the philadelphia project and may  depending on timing  be able to fund a portion of such project out of free cash flow at such time 
however  there can be no assurances such funds will be available  and if so  on terms acceptable to us 
we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with aztar to acquire all of aztar s outstanding shares at a purchase price of in cash per share of aztar common stock subject to the terms and conditions thereof 
we will need approximately billion to acquire aztar net of estimated cash on hand  to refinance aztar s existing credit agreement and senior subordinated debt assuming we decide to refinance all of such debt  to refinance our existing credit agreement and the notes and notes assuming we decide to refinance all of such debt  and to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition 
certain banks have committed to provide us up to approximately billion in financing  which includes a billion seven year term loan facility  a million six and one half year term loan facility  a million five year revolving credit facility and a billion day unsecured senior subordinated interim loan facility which  if not repaid at maturity  would be extended  subject to certain limited terms and conditions  to a year term loan facility 
the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or a base rate plus an interest margin of approximately and  respectively  depending upon loan market conditions and 
table of contents other factors 
the financing commitment contemplates that we would issue approximately billion in debt or other securities prior to or concurrently with the closing of the acquisition in lieu of utilizing the interim loan facility 
if such debt or other securities are not issued by the closing  then we would seek to issue such securities as soon as practicable following the closing to refinance the interim loan facility 
the interim loan facility  if utilized  would bear an interest rate of libor plus  increasing by basis points days after funding and an additional basis points each days thereafter up to a maximum interest rate of per annum 
we would also expect to use a total of approximately million of cash on hand of ours and aztar s to fund the transaction 
after completion of the acquisition  we intend to develop a comprehensive plan for aztar s acre las vegas strip tropicana site 
we estimate that the design phase of this project will take at least two years from the close of the acquisition 
when we are ready to proceed with the redevelopment  we would likely need substantial additional financing for the project  which we expect to be the largest development project we have undertaken to date 
other supplemental data ebitda we define ebitda as earnings before interest expense and interest income  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  loss on early extinguishment of debt  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
we use ebitda as a relevant and useful measure to compare operating results among our properties and between accounting periods 
the presentation of ebitda has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business segments 
ebitda is specifically relevant in evaluating large  long lived hotel casino projects because it provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial  non operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects 
management eliminates the results from discontinued operations as they are discontinued 
additionally  we believe some investors consider ebitda to be a useful measure in determining a company s ability to service or incur indebtedness and for estimating a company s underlying cash flow from operations before capital costs  taxes and capital expenditures 
ebitda  subject to certain adjustments  is also a measure used in debt covenants in our debt agreements 
unlike net income  ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital 
we compensate for these limitations by using ebitda as only one of several comparative tools  together with the common gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and accordingly  may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance amongst different companies 
see notes g and h to the selected financial data for a reconciliation from net income loss to ebitda and for details regarding certain costs that are included in this table

table of contents factors affecting future operating results pending acquisition of aztar corporation 
we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire aztar in a transaction having a value of billion including the refinancing of aztar debt 
aztar operates the tropicana casino and resort in atlantic city  new jersey  the tropicana resort and casino on the strip in las vegas  nevada  as well as other casino facilities in laughlin  nevada  caruthersville  missouri  and evansville  indiana 
we will likely incur substantial costs in continuing the process and consummating the acquisition of aztar 
the closing of the transaction is subject to numerous conditions 
in connection with the acquisition of aztar  we expect to incur a substantial amount of debt to finance the transaction and to refinance some or all of our existing credit agreement and senior subordinated debt 
following the acquisition and after substantial completion of our st 
louis development projects  we may incur substantial additional debt to finance redevelopment of aztar s las vegas tropicana site  which we expect to be the largest development project we have undertaken to date 
we cannot assure you that the results of operations for the combined company will meet our expectations or that it will be sufficient to service the substantial debt we expect to incur 
boomtown new orleans as discussed above  boomtown new orleans reopened on september  after being closed for approximately five weeks due to hurricane katrina 
boomtown is located  and most of its customers reside  on the west bank of the mississippi river  across the river from downtown new orleans 
this area generally did not suffer substantial damage 
much of the recovery effort of new orleans is being staged from the west bank 
additionally  much of the competing casino capacity along the mississippi gulf coast has not reopened 
the facility s revenues since reopening have been above those experienced prior to the hurricane 
such increased operating levels may decline in the future as casino capacity in new orleans reopens  including the mid february reopening of the large land based casino in downtown new orleans 
during  we expensed hurricane repair and related costs of approximately million 
there can be no assurances we will not incur additional costs in in addition  we continue to evaluate whether the hurricane expenses and estimated lost profits exceed our insurance deductibles and therefore whether an insurance claim will be filed 
l auberge du lac l auberge du lac opened may  the facility reopened in october after closing on september due to hurricane rita 
although most of the lake charles  louisiana and surrounding communities have recovered  not all businesses have reopened  including a major dockside casino operator in the lake charles market that has not committed to when  or if  it will reopen 
during  we expensed hurricane repair and related costs of approximately million 
there can be no assurances we will not incur additional costs in in addition  we continue to evaluate whether the hurricane expenses and estimated lost profits exceed our insurance deductibles and therefore whether an insurance claim will be filed 
boomtown reno we anticipate selling approximately acres of land adjacent to our boomtown reno hotel and casino to cabela s retail  inc in consistent with the agreement signed in late december cabela s has announced its intentions to build a large retail store featuring outdoor sporting goods on the land 
a portion of the cost needed to improve access to the site is expected to be financed through the issuance of industrial revenue bonds through local or state governmental authorities 
we have agreed to purchase  if necessary  some of such bonds 
we estimate that we may be required to purchase between million and million of these bonds 
a portion of the land is currently utilized by our existing truck stop and satellite casino operations 
we intend to build a replacement truck stop and satellite casino at another location on the boomtown reno property for approximately million 
we expect to continue operating the existing truck stop and satellite casino until such time 
cabela s has agreed to pay us approximately million 

table of contents casino magic argentina in july  we opened a replacement facility for the existing neuquen casino  the principal casino magic argentina property 
the new facility includes a larger and more lavish casino  a restaurant  several bars and an entertainment venue 
st 
louis development projects in september  we broke ground on our st 
louis city project  and in november began site development activities on our st 
louis county project 
the st 
louis city project is expected to open in the third quarter of development of the county site requires some environmental remediation and construction of a new road to the site 
we therefore estimate that development of the county project will take approximately one year longer than the city project 
both of the projects are subject to ongoing missouri gaming commission mgc approval and licensing 
the issuance of the operating licenses is subject to  among other requirements  maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined by the mgc of at least x  beginning the period ended september  such ratio  which is calculated differently than the calculation under our indentures  for the period ended december  was x 
we believe that future operating results should provide sufficient earnings to meet such ratio  however  no assurances can be given 
we intend to seek to structure the aztar acquisition financing so that the company is in compliance with such ratio  but there is no certainty that we can do so 
in addition  due to the increased diversity and size of the combined companies  we may seek some modification or elimination of the ratio  but there can be no assurance that such modification or elimination would be approved by the missouri gaming commission 
president riverboat casino in early  we entered into an agreement to potentially acquire the president casino st 
louis  a riverboat casino operating in bankruptcy with approximately  slot machines and table games  located within walking distance of our st 
louis city project site 
if completed  the acquisition will provide us immediate access to a workforce trained in casino operations and a database of casino customers in the st 
louis area 
the proposed purchase price is million 
this price will serve as the opening bid in a bankruptcy auction that is scheduled to occur on may  and is subject to overbids by third parties and approval by the bankruptcy court 
in return for providing the minimum bid  we received the right to purchase president casino st 
louis at our then last bid made at the auction which bid may be million if the bidder with the highest bid at the auction fails to close the acquisition 
in addition  the proposed purchase agreement provides that if the bankruptcy court approves a bankruptcy plan for the president casino st 
louis which includes a sale of the facility to a competing bidder at the auction  then we will receive a break up fee of  the proposed purchase price and the break up fee is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court at a hearing scheduled for march  the agreement is also subject to approval by the missouri gaming commission and further bankruptcy proceedings 
we would expect the transaction to close in the second half of if we are the winning bidder 
construction disruption as noted above  in early we announced guestroom expansion plans at boomtown new orleans  belterra casino resort and l auberge du lac  with construction beginning in and completion planned for although the expansions are being planned carefully around existing operations  one or all of such locations may experience some level of construction disruption 
pre opening costs although anticipated pre opening costs are included in our various expansion and development project budgets  such costs are and will continue to be expensed as incurred  in accordance with gaap 
biloxi  mississippi as discussed above  casino magic biloxi was substantially damaged by hurricane katrina and has been closed since late august at this time  we intend to file an insurance claim for both property damage and business interruption in relation to our casino magic biloxi property 
we believe our aggregate million of property insurance is sufficient to cover both the reconstruction of the biloxi facility and our business interruption claims 

table of contents as a result of hurricane katrina  the casino barge was destroyed 
we continue to assess the substantial damage to the hotel structure and its contents 
during  we had recorded insurance receivables of million million of which was received in and million of which was received in as of the end of february  including million for impairment charges for various assets at the facility and million for costs covered by insurance 
we anticipate recording additional insurance receivables as we continue to assess the physical damage to our biloxi facility and evaluate our business interruption claim 
our ultimate claim and likely recovery are unrelated and computed differently from the impairment charges 
we continue to believe we have insurance sufficient to cover the reconstruction or replacement of our biloxi facility  subject to any applicable deductible or other policy limitations 
however  our insurance policies permit the replacement facility to be built anywhere in the us if the replacement facility is not in biloxi  our insurance policies call for payment of the lesser of the cost to build such replacement facility or the then theoretical cost to rebuild the biloxi facility 
we believe that each of our facilities in st 
louis  where in each case we have begun construction  would qualify as a replacement facility 
each facility in st 
louis is significantly larger than the biloxi facility that was damaged 
hence  we believe that we could designate either of the st 
louis facilities as the replacement facility and receive approximately the same insurance proceeds as if we actually rebuilt the biloxi facility 
therefore  management expects to determine whether or not to rebuild the biloxi facility independent of insurance issues and based on management s forecasted profitability of a new facility  taking into consideration the competitive and regulatory market  among other factors 
among such other factors will be our availability of capital and management resources and the expected returns of other investment opportunities 
many of these factors are still highly uncertain in biloxi 
management continues to estimate that it will be months  and perhaps much longer  before we make the final decision to build or not build a new biloxi facility 
in the meantime  we have begun the design work for reconstruction of a replacement facility  so that if conditions are deemed favorable at some future date  reconstruction can begin without delay 
contingencies we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal and income tax matters and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be affected 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the estimates and assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management s judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  industry trends  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations 
we have determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements property and equipment we have a significant investment in long lived property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  the salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in the financial results and whether to record a gain or loss on disposition of an asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
self insurance reserves we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for claims 
in estimating these accruals we consider historical loss experience  make judgments about the expected levels of cost per claim and rely on independent consultants 

table of contents income tax assets and liabilities we utilize estimates related to cash flow projections for the application of sfas no 
to the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in this assessment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we assess the tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis and maintain the required tax reserves until the underlying issue is resolved or upon the expiration of the statue of limitations 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
goodwill and other intangible assets in january  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires an annual review of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates  including recent and future operating results  discount rates  risk premiums and terminal values  to determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units and gaming licenses 
insurance receivables we have significant receivables due from insurance companies related to the biloxi property 
we record receivables to the extent of our net book value for physical property damage and for actual costs incurred under the business interruption coverage 
until such claims are resolved  no gains for coverage in excess of net book value and no potential insurance recoveries for lost profits are recorded 
significant estimates are required in determining the amount of our insurance claims 
we utilize third party insurance claim specialists to assist us in determining the amount of the initial claims and for ongoing monitoring 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all companies to measure compensation costs for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
in april  the sec announced a phased in implementation process for sfas no 
r  such that this statement became effective for us january  we adopted sfas r in the first quarter using the modified prospective method and therefore we will record expense relating to our stock based compensation in the periods subsequent to adoption 
the expense will be based on all unvested options as of the adoption date as well as all future stock based compensation awards 
based on the options outstanding as of december  and assumptions reflecting currently available information  we expect the incremental pre tax expense in fiscal to be approximately million 
such expense is non cash and does not reflect actual stock price performance 
fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas on october  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires companies to expense construction period lease costs and no longer permits capitalizing such costs 
fsp is effective for periods after december   with early adoption permitted  which we elected 
accordingly  we are in compliance with fsp fas accounting for uncertain tax positions in july the fasb released an exposure draft for its proposed interpretation regarding accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the proposed guidance addresses the recognition  measurement  classification  and disclosure issues related to the recording of financial statement benefits for income tax positions that have some degree of uncertainty 
the fasb comment period ended in september in early january  the fasb resumed discussions of the pending interpretation 
the release of a final interpretation is scheduled for march or april 
table of contents the new proposed effective date is for the first fiscal year beginning after december  we are unable to predict the final action by fasb  or the impact of such interpretation on our financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
fin in march  the fasb issued fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
we adopted fin in december consistent with the effective date of the statement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fin refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even if the timing and or settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  the entity must record a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates with respect to the short term floating interest rate on borrowings under our bank credit facility 
at december   approximately of the aggregate principal amount of our funded debt obligations and virtually all of our invested cash balances were subject to floating interest rates 
however  if libor rates were to increase by one percentage point  our interest expense for the term loan facility would increase by million per year  assuming we did not increase our term loan borrowings and the increased rate was in effect throughout note we repaid the revolver facility in mid february 
we would expect that such an increase would be partially offset by increased interest income from our substantial invested funds that are also subject to floating interest rates 
we are also exposed to market risk from adverse changes in the exchange rate of the dollar to the argentine peso 
the total assets of casino magic argentina at december  were million  or approximately of our consolidated assets 
in addition  at this time the bahamian dollar is pegged to the us dollar 
if the bahamian government should choose to no longer peg its currency to the us dollar  we would be subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
finally  in the event we are awarded a gaming license in chile  we would be also be subject to exchange rate fluctuations
