item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements this report contains a number of forward looking statements relative to our future plans and our expectations concerning the north american customer care and billing industry  as well as the converging communications industry it serves  and similar matters 
these forward looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors  and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward looking statements 
some of the risks that are foreseen by management are outlined above within item a  risk factors

management overview market conditions of the communications industry 
the communications industry has experienced significant consolidation and increased competition from non traditional communications providers 
the consolidation that has occurred has resulted in a fewer number of service providers who have massive scale and can deliver a total communications package 
plant upgrades and network rationalizations have  for the most part  been completed  allowing service providers to focus their attention on new revenue and growth opportunities 
in addition  new competitors  new technologies and unique partnerships are forcing service providers to be more creative in their approaches for rolling out new products and services and enhancing their customers experiences 
these factors  in combination with the improving financial condition of service providers  are resulting in a slightly more positive outlook for the demand for scalable  flexible and cost efficient customer care and billing solutions  which we believe will provide us with new revenue opportunities 
however  another facet of this market consolidation poses certain risks to our company 
the consolidation of service providers decreases the potential number of buyers for our products and services  and carries the inherent risk that the consolidators may choose to move their purchased customers to a competitor s system 
should this consolidation result in a concentration of customer accounts being owned by companies with whom we do not have a relationship  or with whom competitors are entrenched  it could negatively affect our ability to maintain or expand our market share  thereby having a material adverse effect to our results of operations 
in addition  service providers at times have chosen to use their size and scale to exercise more severe pressure on pricing negotiations 
our company 
we are a leading provider of outsourced billing  customer care and print and mail solutions and services supporting the north american converged broadband and dbs markets 
our solutions support some of the world s largest and most innovative providers of bundled multi channel video  internet  and ip based services 
our unique combination of solutions  services and expertise ensure that cable and satellite operators can continue to rapidly launch new service offerings  improve operational efficiencies and deliver a high quality customer experience in a competitive and ever changing marketplace 
as noted above  the north american communications industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last few years  resulting in a large percentage of the market being served by a fewer number of service providers with greater size and scale 
today  the top seven providers in the video industry serve over of the consumers 
consistent with this market concentration  a large percentage of our revenues from continuing operations are generated from a limited number of clients  with over of our revenues from continuing operations being generated from our five largest clients  which are comcast  echostar  time warner  charter  and adelphia 
key changes to our business operations 
consistent with our decision to intensify our focus on our core competencies in the cable and dbs markets utilizing our acp product and related services  and improve our operating results  we made several key changes to our business operations during  which are summarized as follows on december   we completed the sale of our gss business to comverse 
in addition  on december   we completed the sale of our planet consulting business to a group of private investors led by the planet management team 
these two businesses were underperforming to our financial expectations and were no longer 
table of contents considered part of our core strategy  and thus they were sold during as a result of our sale of the gss business  we no longer provide customer care and billing products or services outside of north america 
we believe the divestiture of these two businesses will allow our company to allocate greater human capital and financial resources towards our core domestic broadband business 
the historical results of the gss and the planet businesses are reflected as discontinued operations in our results of operations for all periods presented  and are discussed in greater detail below 
in addition  in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the gss business  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred restructuring charges within our continuing operations of million 
these restructuring charges  and greater details of the sale of the gss and planet businesses  are discussed below and in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we currently provide outsourced processing services utilizing the icms customer care and billing software application under a long term processing agreement with fairpoint communications  inc fairpoint  a provider of communication services to rural communities 
fairpoint is our only client that receives processing services utilizing the icms asset in a service bureau environment 
on november   we executed amendments to our long term processing agreement with fairpoint to effectively terminate the agreement the amendments are collectively referred to as the termination agreement 
under the terms of the termination agreement  fairpoint is expected to transition and convert all of its customers to an alternative solution no later than december  in conjunction with the termination of the fairpoint contract  we incurred restructuring charges of million  and recorded a million charge against revenue  during the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details of this matter 
during and  revenues related to this icms service bureau offering which consisted entirely of servicing the fairpoint contract were million and million  and operating losses excluding restructuring charges of million for were million and million  respectively 
we expect to incur an operating loss of approximately million and incur restructuring charges of million million total operating loss during as fairpoint transitions off our system onto a new vendor 
this service offering is significantly underperforming to our original financial expectations and is no longer considered part of our core strategy 
as a result  once the fairpoint customers are fully transitioned to another vendor  we will cease providing our icms service bureau processing services 
in december  we exercised a buyout provision included in the operating lease which was scheduled to expire in for our corporate aircraft for million and then sold the aircraft to an unrelated party in january for million net of costs to sell 
we recorded the loss of million related to this transaction as a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of we believed the use of a corporate aircraft was no longer needed  and thus  the disposal of the aircraft provided us an opportunity to save approximately million annually in operating expenses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details of this matter 
key changes to our executive management team and board of directors 
in addition to the key changes to our business operations summarized above  we also made several significant changes to our management team and our board of directors during  which are summarized as follows in the first quarter of  our then current chairman of the board of directors chairman and chief executive officer ceo  mr 
neal hansen  announced his intent to retire from our company  which led to the following changes effective march   mr 
hansen stepped down as our ceo 
effective april   mr 
edward nafus  our then executive vice president and president of our broadband division  assumed the position of ceo and president of our company 
in addition  effective march   mr 
nafus was added to our board of directors 
effective march   mr 
robert m 
mike scott was made the head of our broadband division 
effective june   mr 
hansen stepped down as chairman  and left our board of directors 
effective july   mr 
bernard reznicek  a current board member  was named non executive chairman to replace mr 
hansen 

table of contents we agreed to pay mr 
hansen million in consideration for certain changes to his employment agreement and for post termination consulting services to be provided as a result of his retirement 
of this amount  million was paid in january  million will be paid on july   and million will be paid on january  as of december   we have recorded expense of million related to mr 
hansen s retirement package  of which million was included in expense for and million was recorded as expense in the remainder of the million of expense will be recorded in the expense related to this matter is reflected within the selling  general and administrative caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during  we also made other changes to our board of directors 
dr 
george haddix one of the co founders of our company with mr 
hansen  resigned from our board of directors  and mr 
don reed and mr 
james unruh were added to our board of directors 
after these changes  six of our seven board members are independent directors 
see our form ks filed on june  and july  for additional details of these matters 
in conjunction with the sale of the gss business mr 
alan michels  our then executive vice president and head of worldwide delivery for our gss division was terminated from our company effective upon the closing of the sale of the gss business 
all expenses related to his termination of employment with our company are included in discontinued operations 
mr 
hank bonde  our then executive vice president and president of the gss division  was terminated from our company effective december  all expenses related to his termination of employment with our company are included in restructuring charges in continuing operations  and are discussed in greater detail below 
as a result of the above actions during  we believe our business is well positioned  and we have a highly qualified executive management team and board of directors in place  to effectively execute on our business strategies going forward 
results of operations 
a summary of our results of operations for is as follows our consolidated revenues from continuing operations for increased million  or  to million  when compared to million for the increase between years is attributable primarily to higher processing revenues between years 
our operating expenses from continuing operations for increased million  or  to million  when compared to million for the increase in operating expenses from continuing operations between years is due primarily to the following the cost of processing and related services revenues were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase relates primarily to an increase in labor related costs  primarily as a result of an increase in staff levels to address the growth opportunities we see for our voip products and services and to accommodate the migration of clients to acp 
restructuring charges were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase relates to the key changes we made to our business operations during  as noted above 
the million of restructuring charges reduced income from continuing operations by per diluted share 
expense related to the retirement of our former ceo was million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
the million of expense recorded for this item reduced income from continuing operations by per diluted share 
our operating income from continuing operations for decreased million  or  to million  when compared to million for the operating income margin from continuing operations for was  compared to for these substantial decreases between years are primarily due to the increase in restructuring charges between years  and the expense incurred in conjunction with the retirement of our former ceo  as discussed above

the increase in these non cash charges between years is due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation as a result of certain equity awards held by key members of our management team having a change in control provision that was triggered upon the closing of the sale of the gss business 
we continue to generate strong cash flows from our operations 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million as of december  the significant increase between years relates primarily to the cash proceeds received from the sale of the gss business 
cash flows from operations for were million  compared to million for  with the decrease between years related primarily to changes in certain working capital items as a result of timing matters  as discussed in greater detail below 
other key matters related to our continuing operations for were as follows total customer accounts processed on our systems as of december  were million  compared to million as of december   an increase of 
the arpu for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in arpu between years relates primarily to the increased usage of ancillary products and services by our clients 
as of december   approximately two thirds of the cable customer accounts processed on our system have been successfully migrated to our acp platform 
we expect to migrate the remaining cable customer accounts to the acp platform by the end of we successfully renewed all of our material client relationships scheduled for renewal during  including extending our agreement with echostar through the end of  and we have no major contracts up for renewal in during the fourth quarter  our board of directors increased the total number of authorized shares to be repurchased under our stock repurchase program by five million shares 
for  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million weighted average price of per share 
as of december   the remaining number of shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program is million shares

table of contents additional information related to our continuing operations our continuing operations consist of the broadband division and corporate overhead expense related to our ongoing business 
summarized information related to these items is show below in thousands 
significant fluctuations in these items between years are discussed throughout our md a and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

adelphia is our fifth largest client 
for both and  revenues from adelphia represented approximately of our total revenues from continuing operations 
we currently process on our systems approximately three million domestic broadband customers for adelphia under a contract that runs through march adelphia has been operating under bankruptcy protection since june it has been publicly announced that adelphia intends to sell out of bankruptcy its broadband business jointly to time warner and comcast 
this transaction is expected to close as early as the second quarter of upon the closing of this transaction  we expect the adelphia customers currently processed by us to remain on our systems and be transferred to the respective comcast and time warner contracts 
because the comcast and time warner contracts have lower per unit pricing than the adelphia contract due to the relative size of comcast and time warner when compared to adelphia  we anticipate that processing revenues related to these customer accounts will be lower in by approximately million  assuming the adelphia transaction closes as expected in the second quarter of charter 
charter is our fourth largest client 
for and  revenues from charter represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues from continuing operations 
we renewed our contract with charter in june  with the term of the new contract running though the end of the charter contract contains provisions establishing annual minimum customer account levels that have to be processed on our systems  which we expect charter to exceed based on the number of charter customers currently on our systems 
under the terms of the charter contract  which does not include exclusivity for us  charter could remove one or more regions from our systems  or significantly reduce the number of customers on our systems  without automatically incurring a financial penalty 
comcast 
comcast continues to be our largest client 
for and  revenues from comcast represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues from continuing operations 
we expect that the percentage of our revenues for related to comcast will trend up slightly from that of  primarily due to the migration of certain adelphia customers to the comcast contract during  as discussed above 
we renewed our contract with comcast in the first quarter of  with the term of the new contract running through the end of the comcast contract contains provisions establishing annual financial minimums for  which we 
table of contents currently expect to exceed based on comcast s more recent spending history with us  and due to number of comcast customers currently on our systems 
under the terms of the comcast contract  which does not include exclusivity for us  comcast could remove one or more regions from our systems  or significantly reduce the number of customers on our systems  without automatically incurring a financial penalty 
the comcast contract and related amendments are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the sec 
the documents are available on the internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details 
echostar 
echostar is our second largest client 
for both and  revenues from echostar represented approximately of our total revenues from continuing operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we signed a new processing agreement with echostar to continue providing customer care and billing support services 
the echostar contract was effective november   runs through the end of december  and provides echostar with the option to extend the term of the agreement for either one or two years beyond the end of december the new contract includes certain financial commitments from echostar such that if echostar terminates the agreement before expiration for reasons other than cause  the balance of the financial commitments will be due to us 
however  the echostar contract does not provide us with the exclusive right to provide customer care and billing services to echostar  which differs from the previous processing agreement with echostar 
the new echostar contract provides for certain pricing reductions when compared to the previous processing agreement with echostar  which by itself  would have resulted in lower revenues from echostar between and by approximately million 
however  we expect that our revenues in related to echostar will not differ materially from that of due to our expectation of continued growth in the number of echostar s customers processed on our systems  and our expectation of selling a historically consistent amount of new products and services to echostar 
the echostar contract is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the sec 
the documents are available on the internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details 
time warner 
time warner is our third largest client 
for both and  revenues from time warner represented approximately of our total revenues from continuing operations 
we expect that the percentage of our revenues in related to time warner will trend up slightly from that of  primarily due to the migration of certain adelphia customers to the time warner contract during  as discussed above 
we renewed our contract with time warner in the second quarter of  with the term of the new contract running though the end of the first quarter of the time warner contract contains provisions establishing annual minimum customer account levels that have to be processed on our systems  which we expect time warner to exceed based on the number of time warner customers currently on our systems  and as a result of the additional customer accounts that are expected to be migrated from the adelphia contract 
under the terms of the time warner contract  which does not include exclusivity for us  time warner could remove one or more regions from our systems  or significantly reduce the number of customers on our systems  without automatically incurring a financial penalty 
stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a five million share increase in the number of shares we are authorized to repurchase under our stock repurchase program  bringing the total number of authorized shares to million 
in april  we established a formal plan with a financial institution that complies with the provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of the rule b plan to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market 
any shares repurchased under the rule b plan are counted towards the million share limit authorized under the stock repurchase program 
the rule b plan supplements any stock repurchases we may decide to purchase under the existing terms of our stock repurchase program 
in effect  the rule b plan facilitates achieving stock buyback objectives more readily by permitting the execution of trades during periods that would otherwise be prohibited by internal trading policies 
the maximum quarterly repurchase limitation established by us under the rule b plan is million 

table of contents as of december   a summary of the shares repurchased under our program is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts total shares repurchased total amount paid weighted average price per share the shares repurchased under the program are being held as treasury shares  and may possibly be used  at our discretion  to fulfill issuances of common stock under our various equity compensation plans 
as of december   the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program totaled million shares 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
subsequent to december  through march   we have repurchased an additional million shares of common stock under the program for million weighted average price of per share  bringing the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program as of march  to million shares 
stock based compensation expense as discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in we adopted the fair value method of accounting for our stock based awards 
stock based compensation expense is included in the following captions in the consolidated statements of operations in thousands year ended december  continuing operations cost of processing and related services 
cost of software  maintenance and services research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total continuing operations discontinued operations total stock based compensation expense we completed an exchange of certain stock options for restricted stock also referred to by us as our tender offer in december as a result  our stock based compensation expense is significantly higher in and when compared to the increase in stock based compensation expense between and is due primarily to certain equity awards held by key members of our management team having a change in control provision that was triggered upon the closing of the sale of the gss business 
the change in control provision resulted in accelerated vesting as of december  for the equity awards impacted  and thus  deferred stock based compensation expense of million related to the accelerated vesting of these equity awards was recorded as stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  of which million was included in discontinued operations  and million was included in continuing operations as part of restructuring charges 
this acceleration of vesting for these equity awards had the effect of eliminating million of stock based compensation that was scheduled to be recognized in had the gss business sale not occurred  of which million relates to discontinued operations  and million relates to continuing operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

table of contents subsequent event purchase of telution  inc on march   we acquired telution  inc telution  a chicago based provider of operations support system oss technologies that enable communications companies to bring bundled  advanced services to market quickly and effectively 
we acquired telution and its comx solution to expand our ability to support cable and satellite operators as they deliver advanced and ip based services  designed to attract and retain consumers who have begun to expect the availability of video  voice and data services over nearly any device at the time and location they choose 
as a result of this acquisition  we will extend our ability to support our clients sales  ordering  partnering and service provisioning processes as well as delivering enhanced customer care capabilities through all customer touch points the web  interactive television  field service  statement  the call center and more 
we will integrate comx into our acp product  accelerating our product roadmap to quickly enable operators to more easily bundle and deploy wireless  content  business services and iptv offerings 
in addition  the integrated solution will enable operators to better support customers of bundled services as they choose new services and seek support for existing services 
we acquired telution for approximately million in cash  which was paid at the closing of the transaction on march  in addition  the purchase agreement provides for contingent payments of up to million over the next three years 
the contingent payments are dependent upon certain product integration and revenue targets 
we do not expect this transaction to have a significant impact on our first quarter revenues  but do expect that the transaction will add million to million in revenues for the full year we expect to incur certain one time charges related to this acquisition in the first quarter of excluding these one time charges  which are not estimatable at this time  we do not expect this acquisition to have a significant impact to our results of operations for the first quarter of or full year critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to select appropriate accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and the results of our business continuing operations 
these critical accounting policies were determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  iii impairment assessments of long lived assets  iv loss contingencies  v income taxes  and vi capitalization of internal software development costs 
these critical accounting policies  as well as our other significant accounting policies  are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the revenue recognition policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments that may have a material impact on our business continuing operations relate to i the application of the guidelines of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf when determining a revenue arrangement s separate units of accounting  and ii the accounting for software arrangements 
for those revenue arrangements subject to the separation criteria of eitf no 
 we account for each of the individual units of accounting as a separate and discrete earnings process considering  among other things  whether a delivered item has value to the client on a stand alone basis 
for such multiple element arrangements  total revenue is allocated to the separate units of accounting based upon objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item 
the determination of separate units of accounting  and the determination of objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item  both require judgments to be made by us 

table of contents the accounting for software arrangements  especially when software is sold in a multiple element arrangement  is complex and requires judgments in the following areas i the identification of the separate elements of the software arrangement  ii the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii the assessment of whether our hosted service transactions meet the requirements of eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to be treated as a separate element to the software arrangement  iv the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the software arrangement  and v the period of time maintenance services are expected to be performed 
the evaluation of these factors  and the ultimate revenue recognition decisions  require significant judgments to be made by us 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
in addition  because software licenses typically have little or no direct  incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue  these judgments could also have a significant effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  and iv a deterioration in a client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  we maintain a general allowance for all our accounts receivable which are not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
our credit risk is heightened due to our concentration of clients within the us and canadian cable television and satellite industries 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change significantly  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
because of the overall significance of our gross billed accounts receivable balance million as of december   such an adjustment could be material 
impairment assessment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  which for us relates primarily to property and equipment and client contracts  are required to be evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
under the current accounting standard  a long lived asset is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  even if by  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of estimated future cash flows and  if required  the determination of the fair value of a long lived asset  are by their nature  highly subjective judgments 
changes to one of more of the assumptions utilized in such an analysis could materially affect our impairment conclusions for long lived assets 
loss contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to claims and potential claims related to various items including but not limited to i legal and regulatory matters  ii client and vendor contracts  iii product and service delivery matters  and iv labor matters 
we follow the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies in determining the appropriate accounting and disclosures for such matters  which requires us to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves for such contingencies  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of the issues  often with the assistance of legal counsel 
the evaluation of such issues  and our ultimate accounting and disclosure decisions  are by their nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly  an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary 
because of the potential significance of these issues  such an adjustment could be material 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate  which includes primarily the us including both federal and state income taxes 
various judgments are required in evaluating our 
table of contents tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of our business  there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain 
in addition  we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities which could result in adverse outcomes 
for these reasons  we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due 
we adjust these reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the closing of a tax year upon the expiration of a statute of limitations 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly  an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary 
because of the potential significance of these issues  such an adjustment could be material 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred income tax assets will be recovered primarily from future taxable income  and to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  which represented approximately of our total assets 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of our net deferred income tax assets 
the assumption of future taxable income is  by its nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
capitalization of internal software development costs 
we expend substantial amounts on r d for both new and existing ie  enhancements software products and related services 
such costs are subject to capitalization under certain circumstances 
the determination of whether internal software r d costs are subject to capitalization is by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period by either i capitalizing development costs  or ii expensing pre technological feasibility and pre application development stage research costs 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software r d costs are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for possible impairment as discussed above for other long lived assets 
we did not capitalize any internal software r d costs  as discussed above  during the years ended december    or in addition  we do not have any capitalized internal software r d costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software r d costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based upon the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software r d efforts are of this nature  and therefore  we believe the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material

table of contents detailed discussion of results of operations total revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii increased million  or  to million  from million for the increase in total revenues from continuing operations between and relates primarily to an increase in our processing revenues 
the large increase in revenues between and was due to the million charge for the comcast arbitration ruling attributable to periods prior to july  that was recorded in the third quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the arbitration proceedings we had with comcast in the comcast arbitration  and the resulting financial impact to our business as a result of the arbitration ruling 
processing revenue 
processing revenues for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii decreased by million  or  to million  from million for the increase in processing revenues between and was primarily due to i an increase in the number of customer accounts processed on our systems  and ii increased usage of ancillary products and services 
these ancillary products and services consist of such things as marketing services and the use of reporting tools 
spending on such items is done at the discretion of our clients 
the demand for such products and services from our clients increased between years  and we expect the demand for such services to remain strong going forward as well 
the decrease in processing revenues between and was primarily due to lower processing revenues from comcast as a result of the comcast arbitration ruling in the third quarter of additional information related to processing revenues is as follows amortization of the client contracts intangible asset reflected as a reduction of processing revenues for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in amortization between years was primarily due to the acceleration of amortization related to the new comcast contract effective in march the comcast contract amortization is expected to be approximately million per quarter through the end of the comcast contract term of december  total customer accounts processed on our systems as of december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in customer accounts processed on our systems between and relates primarily to organic growth experienced by our clients 
during  we renewed a client contract which resulted in a modification to the definition of customer billing units for this client  which had the effect of lowering the customer volume counts 
also  the customers of an internet dial up service provider were converted off our system during these two items together resulted in a total reduction in customer accounts processed on our system by approximately million accounts when compared to those in this reduction was offset principally by organic growth experienced by our existing clients 
arpu for   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in arpu when compared to was primarily attributed to higher revenues related to our clients discretionary and variable use of ancillary products and services  as noted above 
the decrease in arpu when compared to was primarily related to the reduction in comcast processing revenues as a result of the comcast arbitration ruling  as noted above 
the arpu for the fourth quarter of was compared to for the third quarter of the reduction in the fourth quarter arpu is related primarily to the new echostar contract  which went into effect on november  
table of contents software  maintenance and services revenues 
software  maintenance and services revenues for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii was relatively flat between years at million  compared to million for the increase between and was due primarily to an increase in software license sales of our workforce automation and call center solutions during the first half of expected impacts to revenues 
communication service providers continue to look for ways to improve their financial and operational performance 
one way in which service providers attempt to accomplish this is through the selling or exchanging of market locations with other service providers in order to gain a larger concentration of customer accounts within a particular geographic region referred to as regionalization 
such regionalization efforts may result in additions or reductions in the number of customer accounts processed on our systems  depending upon whether the customer accounts impacted by the regionalization projects will be added or removed from one of our clients contracts after the ownership transfer between service providers is completed 
we expect to experience a reduction in the number of customer accounts processed on our systems during the first half of as a result of certain client regionalization projects 
we expect that the impact of these regionalization projects will be the movement of approximately one million customer accounts currently processed on our systems to a competitor s system 
this reduction in customers processed on our systems is not associated with the expected transfer of the adelphia customer accounts mentioned above 
although this reduction in the number of customers processed on our systems  and certain of the client matters discussed above under significant client relationships  are expected to have a negative impact on our revenues  we believe our business opportunities are such that we expect our revenues to be flat to slightly down when compared to revenues from continuing operations 
as a result of the recurring revenue nature of our business model  we have visibility into approximately of our expected revenues 
in addition  we have no major contracts up for renewal in however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to achieve our overall revenue expectations for cost of processing and related services 
the cost of processing and related services revenues consists principally of i data processing and communications costs  ii statement production costs eg  labor  paper  envelopes  equipment  and equipment maintenance  etc  iii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iv various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  and v facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in r d expenses 
the cost of processing and related services for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii increased million  or  to million  from million for the increase in cost of processing and related services between and was primarily due to i an increase in labor related costs  primarily as a result of merit wage increases and the increase in staff levels to support the growth opportunities of our voip products and services and to accommodate the migration of clients to acp  ii an increase in data processing costs  primarily due to growth in the number of customers processed on our systems  and greater processing requirements for acp functionality  and iii an increase in variable costs related to the delivery of ancillary products and services eg  print costs  etc  which directly correlate with the increase in revenues related to ancillary products and services 
the increase in cost of processing and related services between and was primarily due to i an increase in data processing costs  primarily due to greater processing requirements for acp functionality  and an increase in the cumulative number of our clients customer accounts processed on our system throughout the year  and ii an increase in stock based compensation expense 
in response to the expected reduction in revenues resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling  during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a cost reduction initiative  consisting primarily of involuntary employee terminations and a reduction of costs related to certain of our employee compensation and fringe benefit programs  to include a freeze in wages for a large percentage of the expected savings from this cost reduction initiative was expected to impact our cost of processing and related services 
however  the benefits from the cost reduction initiative implemented in late were principally offset by an increase in labor related costs primarily as a result 
table of contents of the merit wage increases in august and the increase in staff added in the latter part of to support the growth opportunities of our voip products and services and migration of clients to acp 
gross margin percentages related to our processing and related services revenues were   and for   and  respectively 
the decreases in the gross margin percentages between years relates primarily to the increase in costs related to the voip and acp initiatives  as mentioned above  without a commensurate increase in revenues associated with such initiatives 
this is the result of the investment we are making in our voip products and services  as well as our efforts to migrate our clients to the acp platform 
that is  we do not receive any additional revenue from our clients associated with their migration to the acp platform 
in addition  at this time  the incremental revenues from voip products and services are not significant 
in addition  the gross margin percentages were negatively impacted by the lower comcast revenues beginning in our gross margin percentage related to processing and related services revenues for the fourth quarter of was approximately  which reflected the impact of two months of the new pricing under the echostar contract 
cost of software  maintenance and services 
the cost of software  maintenance and services revenues consists principally of i client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  ii various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  iii professional services organizations  iv facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations  and v third party software costs and or royalties related to certain software products 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in r d expenses 
the cost of software  maintenance and services for i decreased million  or  to million  from million for and ii decreased million  or  to million  from million for the decrease was related primarily to reductions in our personnel assigned to software maintenance projects 
gross margin loss percentages related to our software  maintenance and services revenues were   and for   and  respectively 
the improvement in the gross margin percentages between years primarily related to lower costs between periods  as noted above  and having the benefit of the impact of increased software license sales of our workforce automation and call center solutions during the first half of variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses  and perform professional services 
our quarterly revenues for software licenses and professional services revenues may fluctuate  depending on various factors  including the timing of executed contracts and revenue recognition  and the delivery of contracted services or products 
however  the costs associated with software and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree of variability ie  these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time  and thus  fluctuations in our software and maintenance  professional services  and overall gross margins  will likely occur between periods 
overall gross margin 
our overall gross margin for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the overall gross margin percentages for   and were   and  respectively 
the changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage between and were due to the factors discussed above 
the gross margin and gross margin percentage for were significantly impacted by the comcast arbitration ruling 
the million reduction in processing revenues in related to the comcast arbitration ruling had the effect of lowering our overall gross margin percentage by approximately percentage points 
r d expense 
r d expense for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii increased million  or  to million  from million for these increases were primarily due to increased employee related costs  to include the impacts of the merit wage increases in august and during   and  we focused our development and enhancement efforts on various r d projects consisting principally of enhancements to acp functionalities and related software products  targeted to increase the functionalities and features of the products  including those necessary to service voip product offerings 
we did not capitalize any internal 
table of contents software development costs during   and as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the reason for the decrease in r d expense as a percentage of total revenues between and was due to the lower revenues in resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling 
absent the impact of the million reduction in processing revenues in related to the comcast arbitration ruling  r d expense as a percentage of revenues would have been 
at this time  we expect our future r d efforts to continue to focus on similar tasks as noted above  and we expect to spend a larger percentage of our total revenues on r d in the future 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense for i increased million  or  to million  from million for  and ii decreased million  or  to million  from million for as a percentage of total revenues  sg a expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expense between and relates primarily to i an increase of million related to the retirement benefits recorded for our former ceo  as discussed above  ii an increase of million in various personnel related costs  principally related to stock based compensation expense as a result of new equity awards  and iii an increase in bad debt expense between years due to the recognition of negative bad debt expense of approximately million in related to the sale of the adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details  with no comparable amount for these increases were offset to a certain degree by million of expense recorded in related to other executive management departures from our company 
the decrease in sg a expense between and relates primarily to i a decrease in legal fees due to the comcast arbitration concluding in october such costs were approximately million for with no comparable amounts in  and to a much lesser degree ii a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million in due to the recognition of negative bad debt expense in related to the sale of the adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable  with no comparable amounts in these decreases were offset to a certain degree by million of expense recorded in related to other executive management departures from our company  and ii an increase in stock based compensation between periods of million 
the increase in stock based compensation relates to our exchange of certain stock options for restricted stock in december depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses 
depreciation expense for i was million  compared to million for  and ii was million compared to million for the decreases in depreciation expense between years relate primarily to the limited amount of capital expenditures in and  as a result of our focus on cost controls during this time frame 
the limited amount of capital expenditures during this time period did not have a material adverse impact on our business 
capital expenditures from continuing operations during   and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and consisted principally of i computer hardware and related equipment  ii statement production equipment  and iii facilities and internal infrastructure improvements 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  and to be consistent with the types of purchases we have made over the most recent years  as noted above 

table of contents restructuring charges 
our restructuring charges relate to various cost reduction initiatives implemented primarily as a result of the comcast arbitration ruling in and the changes we made to our business operations in  as discussed above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our cost reduction initiatives and related restructuring charges  including the current activity in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring charges 
restructuring charges included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related estimated income tax expense these restructuring charges had on net income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share  for the years ended december    and are as follows in thousands  except diluted earnings per share year ended december  activities related to the sale of the gss business stock based compensation related to change in control provision involuntary termination of executive officer involuntary termination of certain corporate support staff management incentive bonuses related to the gss business sale subtotal restructuring charges related to the sale of the gss business disposal of corporate aircraft termination of the fairpoint contract facility abandonments involuntary terminations primarily related to the comcast arbitration ruling all other restructuring charges total restructuring charges impact of restructuring charges on results of continuing operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share these involuntary terminations are expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
in addition  the disposal of the corporate aircraft is expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
at this time  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in of million  of which approximately million relates to the fairpoint contract termination  and the remainder relates to further facility consolidations 
operating income 
operating income for i was million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues for  and ii was million  or of total revenues  compared to an operating loss of million  or of total revenues for the decreases in operating income and the operating income margin between and are primarily due to the increase in restructuring charges between years  and the expense incurred in conjunction with the retirement of our former ceo  as discussed above 
the million of restructuring charges and the million of retirement benefits recorded in had the effect of reducing our operating margin by percentage points for since we do not expect costs of this nature to occur to this degree in  we expect our operating income and net income to improve in  when compared to that of the substantial improvement in operating income between and was mainly due to the increase in revenue between years  primarily due to the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling in  and to a much lesser extent  an improvement in total operating expense between years 
our total consolidated operating expenses for decreased million  or  to million  when compared to million for  primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during the million reduction in processing revenues in related to the comcast arbitration ruling had the effect of lowering our operating income margin percentage by approximately percentage points 

table of contents our operating results include non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization primarily shown as a reduction of processing revenues  and stock based compensation expense 
the total amount of these non cash expenses  and their impact net of related estimated income tax expense on net income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share  for the years ended december    and are as follows in thousands  except diluted earnings per share year ended december  non cash expenses related to depreciation amortization stock based employee compensation total impact of non cash expenses on results of continuing operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share interest expense 
the following are the key changes related to our interest expense between years interest expense for i decreased million  or  to million  from million for  ii decreased million  or  to million  from million for the weighted average balance of our long term debt for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt borrowings for   and  including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility  was   and  respectively 
the change in the weighted average balance of our long term debt and the weighted average interest rate between years relates primarily to the issuance of our convertible debt securities in june and the retirement of our credit facility with the proceeds from such issuance 
the convertible debt securities have a stated coupon rate of  which is substantially less than the interest rates paid on our previous bank debt 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our convertible debt securities 
write off of deferred financing costs 
as result of the repayment and termination of the credit facility with the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible debt securities in june  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs attributable to the credit facility of million pretax impact during the second quarter of  which had the effect of reducing our net income per diluted share by 
interest and investment income  net 
interest and investment income  net  for i increased million to million for  from million for  ii was million  compared to million for the large increase in was primarily attributable to an increase in operating funds available for investment throughout the year and the interest earned on the cash proceeds received from the sale of the gss business 
income tax provision benefit 
the following are the key changes related to our income tax provision benefit between years for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately  compared to an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately for the year ended december  
table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately 
the effective income tax rate was impacted by our net operating loss position resulting from the million comcast arbitration charge  as discussed above  as well as the resolution of certain state and federal income tax issues 
as of december   our net deferred income tax assets were million and represented approximately of total assets 
we continue to believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of these deferred income tax assets 
our assumptions of future profitable operations are supported by our strong operating performances over the last several years 
discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale of the gss and planet businesses discussed above  the gss and planet businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our results of operations for all periods presented 
gain loss from discontinued operations net of tax for i increased million to million  from million for  and ii improved million to million  from million for the components of the gss and planet businesses included in discontinued operations with the period for the gss business representing january  through december  and the significant fluctuations between periods  are as follows in thousands year ended december  gss business total revenues operating expenses restructuring charges all other operating expenses total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net gain on sale of business discontinued operations  before income taxes income tax benefit discontinued operations  net of tax year ended december  planet business total revenues total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss on sale of business discontinued operations  before income taxes income tax benefit discontinued operations  net of tax as required by sfas no 
 our gss business long lived assets related to property and equipment and software were no longer subject to periodic depreciation and amortization once the gss business assets were classified as held for sale as of september  therefore  our results of discontinued operations for the gss business for   and include nine  twelve  and twelve months  respectively  of depreciation and amortization related to these long 
table of contents lived assets 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expense related to the long lived assets of the gss business included in discontinued operations for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the change in operating loss between and relates primarily to the restructuring activities undertaken in we incurred significant restructuring charges in as part of a cost reduction initiative for the gss business 
the lower operating expenses in reflect the success of the restructuring activity  and the improvement in restructuring charges between periods 
the change in operating loss between and relates primarily to the change in restructuring charges between years 
in  we recorded significant restructuring charges related to the abandonment of a facility and the realignment of certain management and sales personnel 
this relates primarily to foreign currency gains and losses  which fluctuated between years as a result of changes in the exchange rates for various foreign currencies  principally the british pound and the euro 
these amounts related to the respective gain and loss on the disposition of the businesses 
the results of operations for the gss and planet businesses reflected in the above table differs from that disclosed in our unaudited condensed financial statements presented in our january  quarterly earnings release and related form k furnished on that date 
the differences relate primarily to the determination of the final purchase price for both businesses that were completed after january  and are now reflected in the audited december  consolidated financial statements  and the final determination of the gain and loss on the sale of the gss and planet businesses and related income tax impacts  which were still in progress as of january  the change in our earnings as a result of this final accounting is summarized as follows in thousands  except per share amounts quarter ended december  year ended december  previously reported final results increase previously reported final results increase income loss  net of tax income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income diluted earnings loss per common share income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income liquidity basis of presentation 
cash flows have not been segregated between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
therefore  all historical cash flow information presented below reflects the cash flow results from both continuing and discontinued operations 
however  the december  consolidated balance sheet has been restated to reflect the balance sheet components of the gss and planet businesses as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations 
we believe this presentation provides a comparable basis to analyze our balance sheet activity for continuing operations between the december  and balance sheet dates 
therefore  all balance sheet information and related discussions presented below reflect this restatement  unless otherwise noted 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the basis of presentation for our discontinued operations 
cash and liquidity 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  compared to million as of december  the increase is primarily due to the cash proceeds we received from the sale of the gss business in december we generally invest our excess cash 
table of contents balances in low risk  short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks 
all of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are located in the us  and as a result  we have ready access to all of our cash and short term investment balances 
in addition to the above sources of liquidity  we also have a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of us financial institutions that expires in september the revolving credit facility has a million sub facility for standby and commercial letters of credit and a million sub facility for same day advances 
as of the date of this filing  we have made no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to a limitation of total indebtedness based upon the results of consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratio calculations  and a minimum liquidity requirement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants of the revolving credit facility  and had  after taking into consideration outstanding letters of credit  approximately million of the revolving credit facility available to us 
as of the date of this filing  the outstanding letters of credit have been cancelled  and thus  the entire million is available to us 
cash flows from operating activities 
we calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  beginning with net income loss and then adding back the impact of non cash items eg  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  etc  and then factoring in the impact of changes in working capital items 
the primary use of our cash is to fund our operating activities 
approximately one half of our total operating costs relate to labor costs both employees and contracted labor for i compensation  ii related fringe benefits  and iii reimbursements for travel and entertainment expenses 
the other primary cash requirements for our operating expenses consist of i postage  ii paper and related supplies for our statement processing centers  iii data processing and related services and communication lines for our service bureau processing business  and iv rent and related facility costs 
these items are purchased under a variety of both short term and long term contractual commitments 
see cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities below for the other primary uses of our cash 
a summary of our material contractual obligations is provided below as well 
our primary source of cash is from our operating activities 
our current business model consists of a significant amount of recurring revenue sources related to our long term processing arrangements billed monthly  and software maintenance agreements billed monthly  quarterly  or annually 
this recurring revenue base provides us with a reliable and predictable source of cash 
in addition  software license fees and professional services revenues provide for material amounts of cash  but the payment streams for these items are not as predictable 
our consolidated net cash flows provided by used in operating activities  which consists of cash from operations and changes in working capital items  for the quarters and years ended for the indicated periods are as follows in thousands 
these amounts are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
quarter ended march june september december years ended cash flows from operations for the first quarter of reflect approximately million of favorable changes in working capital related to the comcast arbitration 
approximately million of the cash flows from operations for the second quarter of can be attributed to the sale of certain adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable see note to our consolidated financial statements to a third party and to higher than normal cash collections of accounts receivable within the gss business 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of were negatively impacted by approximately million due to a key domestic client delaying payment of an invoice until after quarterend 
this amount was subsequently paid in april  which resulted in the payment of four monthly invoices by this client in the second quarter of the payment of the delayed invoice  along with payments related to certain one time client contract settlements  contributed approximately million to our cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of the cash flow used in operating activities of million in the fourth quarter of relates primarily to the million paid to comcast during the fourth quarter of as a result of the comcast arbitration ruling 
absent this amount  we generated strong cash flows from operating activities for  primarily as a result of our improved cash collections of our gss business accounts receivable during the last two quarters of cash flows from operating activities for the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by approximately million due to a key domestic client delaying payment of an invoice until after quarterend 
this amount was received in january we believe this table illustrates our ability to consistently generate strong quarterly and annual cash flows  and the importance of managing our working capital items  in particular  timely collections of our accounts receivable 
the cash flows related to the gss and planet business in were not significant when compared to that of our continuing operations 
therefore  we do not expect the sale of the gss and planet businesses to have a significant impact on our liquidity or cash flows from operating activities in the future 
management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities 
our billed trade accounts receivable balance includes billings for several non revenue items primarily postage  sales tax  and deferred revenue items 
as a result  we evaluate our performance in collecting our accounts receivable through our calculation of days billings outstanding dbo rather than a typical days sales outstanding dso calculation 
dbo is calculated based on the billings for the period including non revenue items divided by the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period 
our target range for our dbo is days 
our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable allowance related to our continuing operations as of the end of the indicated periods  and the related dbos for the quarters then ended  are as follows in thousands  except dbos quarter ended gross allowance net billed dbo december march june september december the increase in both the gross and net billed accounts receivable between september  and december  is due primarily to a key domestic client delaying payment of approximately million until after quarterend  as discussed above 
significant fluctuations in key balance sheet items between december  and  related to our continuing operations  that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows 
other current assets 
the increase in other current assets from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to the disposal of our corporate aircraft  as discussed above 
as of december   other current assets included million related to the carrying value of the aircraft we purchased in december in conjunction with the buyout of our lease 
we sold the aircraft in january  and 
table of contents the final purchase price for the gss business due from comverse 
as of december   other current assets included million related to the final purchase price due from comverse 
this amount was paid by comverse in february accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payable from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to accrued costs eg  attorney fees  etc 
related to the sale of the gss business 
a significant portion of these costs are expected to be paid in the first quarter of accrued employee compensation 
the increase in accrued employee compensation from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to the accrual of retirement benefits for our former ceo during  as discussed above 
we paid million of the retirement benefits to our former ceo in january  with the remaining payments due as follows million scheduled to be paid in july  and million scheduled to be paid in january as of december   of the total million accrued  million is included in accrued employee compensation  and million is included in other non current liabilities 
deferred revenue 
the increase in deferred revenue from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to the deferral of fees related to conversion set up services provided under long term processing contracts 
such fees will be recognized as revenue over the term of the respective processing contract as the related processing services are performed 
income taxes 
the decrease in income taxes payable from million as of december  to zero as of december  relates primarily to the timing of income tax payments 
the estimation of  and the timing related to  our quarterly tax payments were such that we were in a payable situation as of december   and in a receivable position as of december  the income tax receivable recorded as of december  is expected to be substantially collected in the first half of other current liabilities 
the increase in other current liabilities from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to the termination of the fairpoint contract  as discussed above 
under the terms of the fairpoint termination agreement  we are required to pay fairpoint a million termination fee during the full amount of this termination fee was accrued as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this matter 
other non current liabilities 
the increase in other non current liabilities from million as of december  to million as of december  relates primarily to the accrual of the non current portion ie  to be paid in of the retirement benefits to be made to our former ceo million as of december   as mentioned above  and indemnifications totaling million that were recorded in conjunction with the sale of the gss and planet businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this matter 
the comcast arbitration ruling in had the following key impacts to changes in our operating assets and liabilities for and  as reflected in our cash flows from operating activities for these periods 

table of contents arbitration charge payable 
the decrease in the arbitration charge payable reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows relates to the million comcast arbitration award 
we paid approximately million of this amount in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  we paid the remaining approximately million 
income tax payable receivable 
we were in a domestic net operating loss nol position for as a result of the million comcast charge recorded in as a result  our income tax receivable as of december  was million  which resulted from our ability to claim a refund for income taxes already paid  and from our ability to carry back our nol to prior years 
during the first quarter of  we received approximately million of this income tax receivable  and identified additional income tax receivable amounts during our final preparation of our us federal income tax return  which was filed in march as a result  our december   income taxes receivable was million 
cash flows from investing activities 
during  our cash flows from investing activities included two unique items already discussed above the net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations the gss and planet businesses and the purchase of the corporate aircraft held for sale 
our typical investing activities consist of purchases sales of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment  and investments in client contracts  which are discussed as follows purchases sales of short term investments 
we generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks 
these short term investments are readily convertible into cash 
during the year ended december   we purchased million and sold million of short term investments 
we continually evaluate the possible uses of our excess cash balances and will likely purchase additional short term investments in the future 
property and equipment client contracts 
our business is not capital intensive 
our biggest capital outlays typically relate to computer and statement production equipment 
our investment in client contracts typically consists of cash payments to clients as an incentive to bring business to our company  and direct and incremental costs that we have capitalized related to revenue arrangements where we are required to defer conversion set up services fees and recognize those fees as the related processing services are performed 
our annual capital expenditures for property and equipment  and investments in client contracts were as follows in thousands property and equipment client contracts of the property and equipment capital expenditures for the year ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  related to our continuing operations 
our property and equipment expenditures consisted principally of computer hardware and related equipment  and facilities and internal infrastructure items 
for  we expect that capital expenditures related to our continuing operations will be approximately million 
all of the investments in client contracts for the year ended december  and related to our continuing operations 
these investments relate primarily to costs incurred for conversion set up services related to long term processing arrangements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of those indemnifications 
capital resources our discontinued operations did not have a significant impact on our historical sources or uses of capital resources  and therefore  we expect the sale of the gss and planet businesses to have little to no effect on our future sources or uses of capital resources 
as of december   we had million of cash and short term investments available to fund our operations  and we expect to generate additional cash during the following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase program 
at this time  we expect to purchase approximately million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during we have the ability to purchase a greater amount of shares under the stock repurchase plan during we acquired telution for approximately million in cash  which was paid at the closing of the transaction on march  in addition  the purchase agreement provides for contingent payments of up to million over the next three years 
the contingent payments are dependent upon certain product integration and revenue targets 
at this time  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during however  as of december   we have made no significant capital commitments

hansen  million of retirement benefits  of which million was paid in january  million will be paid in july  and million will be paid in january we are required to pay fairpoint million pursuant to our termination agreement during our convertible debt securities bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible debt securities are callable by us for cash  on or after june  the convertible debt securities can be put back to us by the holders for cash at june   and  or upon a change of control  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible debt securities  plus accrued interest

we do not expect any of the conversion triggers to occur during the next months 
as a result  in the near term  we expect our annual debt service costs related to the convertible debt securities to be limited to the annual interest payments of million 
the convertible debt securities are convertible into the our common stock  under the specified conditions and settlement terms outlined above  at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of convertible debt securities  which is equal to an effective conversion price of per share 
the bond indenture includes anti dilution provisions for the holders such that the conversion rate and thus  the effective conversion price can be adjusted in the future for certain events  to include stock dividends  stock splits reverse splits  the issuance of warrants to purchase our stock at a price below the then current market price  cash dividends  and certain purchases of our common stock by us pursuant to a self tender offer or exchange offer 
a lower effective conversion price may have several impacts to us  including a greater potential for i the occurrence of the conversion trigger based upon the price of our common stock  and ii the convertible debt securities having an
