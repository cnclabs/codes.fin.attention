financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade sales revenue and expenses 
year ended december  trade revenue trade expenses 
table of contents costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation  insurance and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  stock based compensation  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is approximately  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and reporting units on at least an annual basis 
we combine our fcc broadcasting licenses into single units of accounting based on our market clusters for impairment testing purposes 
to assist in estimating the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses as of december   we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
the appraisal company estimated the fair values of our fm broadcast licenses using discounted future cash flows and the fair values of our am licenses using a market valuation approach 
the appraisal includes several assumptions and estimates including the determination of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
if the appraisal company had made different assumptions or used different estimates  including those used to determine future cash flows and the discount rate  the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses could have been materially different 
we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our augusta  ga market cluster in for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
we used internally generated estimates of future cash flows to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of december  these estimates required management judgment and if we had made different assumptions the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
we did not record any impairment losses on our goodwill in there can be no assurance that impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses or goodwill will not occur in future periods 
impairment of property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 

table of contents recent pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
under opinion  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we expect to record an additional million of stock based compensation expense during related to previous grants of stock options 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas replaces apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our earnings or financial position

liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio  and maintenance of our broadcasting equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 
other liquidity needs for the next twelve months and thereafter may also include additional share repurchases  payments of cash dividends and radio station acquisitions 
our credit agreement permits us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased million of our class a common stock 
our amended credit agreement also permits us to pay dividends on our common stock in an amount up to an aggregate of million per year 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and had million in remaining commitments available under the revolving portion of our credit facility  however  as of december   our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under the revolving portion of our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
additionally  to the extent that we determine to make additional share repurchases or make 
table of contents future dividend payments instead of repaying indebtedness  or if we incur additional indebtedness in order to make such repurchases or dividend payments  our total debt ratio may be adversely affected and we may not be permitted to make additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
as of december   all of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point increase in the current interest rate under these borrowings  we estimate that our annualized interest expense would increase by million and our net income would decrease by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
as of december   we are a party to five interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount 
these agreements expire from may to august as of december   the fair value of these agreements was a current asset of million
