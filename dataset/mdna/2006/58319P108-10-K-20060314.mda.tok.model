description of business we are a publicly traded specialty risk management company  with an emphasis on alternative market insurance and risk management solutions for agents  professional and trade associations  and small to medium sized insureds 
the alternative market includes a wide range of approaches to financing and managing risk exposures  such as captives  rent a captives  risk retention and risk purchasing groups  governmental pools and trusts  and self insurance plans 
the alternative market developed as a result of the historical volatility in the cost and availability of traditional commercial insurance coverages  and usually involves some form of self insurance or risk sharing on the part of the client 
we develop and manage alternative risk management programs for defined client groups and their members 
we also operate as an insurance agency representing unaffiliated insurance companies in placing insurance coverages for policyholders 
we define our business segments as specialty risk management operations and agency operations 
in june  we sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
in conjunction  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to acquire  of additional shares of our common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of million 
we utilized million of the million raised in the public offering to pay down our line of credit by million and contributed million to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in september  an unconsolidated subsidiary trust issued million of mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities to a trust formed by an institutional investor 
contemporaneously  we issued million in junior subordinated debentures  which includes our  investment in the trust 
we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuance of these debentures  of which million was contributed to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in april and may  we issued senior debentures in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we contributed million of the proceeds from the senior debentures to our insurance company subsidiaries and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
in september  an unconsolidated subsidiary trust issued million of mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities to a trust formed by an institutional investor 
contemporaneously  we issued million in junior subordinated debentures  which includes our  investment in the trust 
we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuance of these debentures 
we contributed million of the proceeds to our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance will be used for general corporate purposes 
specialty risk management operations our specialty risk management operations segment focuses on specialty or niche insurance business in which we provide various services and coverages tailored to meet the specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include  risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  and inland marine 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages from our specialty risk management operations within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
we categorize our programs into three categories managed  risk sharing  and fully insured 
with managed programs  we earn service fee revenue by providing management and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results 
with risk sharing programs  we share the operating results with the client through a reinsurance agreement with captive or rent a captive 
the captive and rent a captive structures are licensed reinsurance companies  which have a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets  and are in the reinsurance business for the purpose of providing a return to their investors  who are the shareholders primary beneficiaries of the captive company 
these primary beneficiaries have their own equity at risk  decision making authority  and the ability to absorb losses and are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in addition to premium revenue and investment income from our net retained portion of the operating results  we may also be compensated through the receipt of ceding commissions and other fees for policy issuance services and acquisition costs  captive administration  reinsurance placement  loss prevention services  and claims administrative and handling services 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through the ceding commission 
for financial reporting purposes  ceding commissions are treated as a reduction in underwriting expenses 
with fully insured programs  we provide our insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are generally developed in response to a specific market opportunity and when we believe there is potential to evolve into a risk sharing mechanism 
agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agency  which was formed in the agency has grown to be one of the largest agencies in michigan and  with acquisitions  has expanded into california and florida 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 
the agency produces an immaterial amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains specialty risk management agency operations reconciling items intersegment revenue consolidated revenue we reclassified and revenues related to the conversion of a west coast commercial transportation program  which was converted to a specialty risk program with one of our subsidiaries  from the agency operations segment to the specialty risk management operations segment 
accordingly  the agency operations revenue and intersegment revenue have been reclassified 
as a result  million and million were reclassified within the agency operations segment and the intersegment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in december  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for the sale of land 
in july  a land contract was executed and the transaction closed in escrow subject to the conveyance of certain land by the city to both parties 
in may  the settlement of the land contract was completed 
the sale of this land resulted in a total gain of approximately  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  we recorded this transaction based on the installment method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded a gain of  as of june   which reflects a portion of the total gain allocated proportionately based on the down payment to the total purchase price 
the remaining  will be deferred until the land contract is paid in full  or as principal payments are received 
in addition  we received  in interest income related to the land contract  which has been included in reconciling items 
the remaining  in reconciling items relates to miscellaneous interest income 
during  we accelerated the recognition of million in deferred claim revenue  as a result of an earlier than anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
these contracts had been terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of had the contract not been terminated  we would have received additional claims fee revenue for continued claims handling services 
critical accounting estimates general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represent case base estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed retroceded assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business based upon an individual company s market share by state 
in reference to the above table  the reserves related to our direct business and assumed business which we manage directly  are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
accordingly  the case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no backlog  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag and include an estimated reserve based upon actuarial methods for this lag 
assumed business which is subsequently retroceded to participating reinsurers relates to business previously discontinued and now is in run off 
lastly  in relation to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received by cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
to date  in the aggregate  there have been no material disputes with our reinsurers 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future willingness or ability of any of our reinsurers to meet their obligations 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
our reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions we use in our selection of ultimate reserves include underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
investments and other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes  and  accordingly have no effect on net income 
however  if there is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost and the decline is considered other than temporary  the amount of decline below cost is charged to earnings 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
our investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
our policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of  but not limited to  the following factors rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in income 
there were no impaired investments written down in   and there can be no assurance  however  that significant changes in the above factors in relation to our investment portfolio  will not result in future impairment charges 
at december  and  we had and securities that were in an unrealized loss position  respectively 
these investments all had unrealized losses of less than ten percent 
at december   thirty nine of those investments  with an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
at december   two investments  with an aggregate million and  fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued were in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize premiums written as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of an in force policy 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
for the year ending december   total assumed written premiums were million  of which million  relates to assumed business we manage directly  and therefore  no estimation is involved 
the related transactions of this business are processed through our internal systems and related controls and therefore  the assumed written premiums are on a current basis and no estimate is required 
furthermore  commission and related expenses are recorded on a current basis through our internal systems and controls 
the remaining million of assumed written premiums represents million related to residual markets  of which  relates to the change in lag estimate  which is estimated utilizing actuarial methods  and  related to other business 
assumed premium estimates are specifically related to the mandatory assumed pool business from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  or residual market business 
the pools cede workers compensation business to participating companies based upon the individual company s market share by state 
the activity is reported from the ncci to participating companies on a two quarter lag 
to accommodate this lag  we estimate premium and loss activity based on historical and market based results 
the expenses related to residual markets are recorded based upon actual data received by the states and an estimate for expenses related to the two quarter lag is developed utilizing actuarial methods 
as of december   assumed premium receivables related to the estimated amount were million 
this primarily relates to the national pool  which is largely impacted by various state market share of individual companies 
historically  we have not experienced any material difficulties or disputes in collecting balances from ncci  and therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded related to the assumed premium estimate 
in addition  certain premiums are subject to retrospective premium adjustments 
premium is recognized over the term of the insurance contract 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims administration services  is recognized in the period the services are provided 
claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the contractually defined termination date of the related contracts  fees are deferred in an amount equal to an estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of any sub producer commission expense 
commission and other adjustments are recorded when they occur and we maintain an allowance for estimated policy cancellations and commission returns 
profit sharing commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries acquired 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and  at least annually  we test all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
our annual assessment date for goodwill impairment testing is october st 
we test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment to goodwill 
we carry goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill impairment  we determined that no impairment to goodwill exists 
results of operations executive overview during  we experienced continued overall improvement in underwriting results in comparison to this improvement is primarily the result of our controlled growth of premiums written and the impact of rate increases in and growth of net income demonstrates our ongoing commitment to strong underwriting discipline  our consistent focus on growing our profitable specialty and fee for service programs  the leveraging of fixed costs  as well as our overall expense reduction initiatives 
in addition  we continued to achieve operational efficiencies and enhancements in as a result  our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to in from in in april  we announced an upgrade to the rating from am best of certain of our insurance company subsidiaries from b very good  with a positive outlook to b very good 
the ratings upgrade applies to star insurance company star  savers property and casualty insurance company  and williamsburg national insurance company 
additionally  am best reaffirmed the rating for ameritrust insurance corporation as b very good  with a positive outlook 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in september  we raised million from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures 
in  we had raised million from the issuance of senior debentures 
with our capital raising efforts  we have remained focused on a systematic deployment of proceeds from these transactions 
as a result of our controlled growth of premiums written and the impact of rate increases in  our net earned premiums increased million  or in comparison to our gross written premiums increased million  or in comparison to we continue to be selective on new programs we implement and focus on those which are in line with our underwriting discipline and have historically been profitable 
in addition  we increased our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties 
we continue to remain focused on the leveraging of fixed costs  as well as maximizing statutory surplus and cash flows 
statutory surplus increased to million in  from million in in  we had positive cash flow from operations of million  compared to million in compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement is primarily the result of our controlled growth of premiums written  the impact from rate increases in and  overall expense initiatives  and the continued leveraging of fixed costs 
as previously indicated  we increased our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties  which favorably impacted net earned premiums and net income 
these year over year improvements manifested  despite the favorable effect in the third quarter of  from the acceleration of million in deferred revenue  less approximately  in expenses and million in taxes  relating to the early termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
in addition  net income was favorably impacted by approximately  from profit sharing commissions received in  partially offset by continuing expenses primarily related to implementation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
net income was also favorably impacted as a result of a  increase in the deferred tax asset relating to the increase in the statutory federal tax rate from to 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums is the result of our controlled growth in written premiums from various existing programs and new programs implemented in  a higher retention on certain reinsurance treaties effective in  and the impact of an overall rate increase in partially offsetting these increases in revenue was an approximate million decrease in managed fee revenue  which was primarily the result of an acceleration of million in deferred claim fee revenue recognized in the third quarter of this comparative decrease in managed fee revenue in is due to the acceleration of deferred claim fee revenue in  as the result of the earlier than anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
these contracts had been terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of therefore  the revenues that we anticipated earning in the first nine months of were accelerated into the third quarter of in addition  the increase in revenue reflects a million increase in investment income  primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets and a slight increase in yield 
compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from a net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement reflects an improvement in underwriting results  as a result of the controlled growth of written premiums in profitable programs written in  continued rate increases  growth in agency commission  control over expenses  and leveraging of fixed costs 
in addition  this improvement in net income reflects an after tax benefit of approximately million from the acceleration of deferred claim fee revenue  net of expenses  as the result of the earlier than meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the growth in net earned premiums primarily reflects the earning pattern of programs written in  which include the conversion of an existing west coast commercial transportation program to one of our insurance subsidiaries  the impact of a renewal rights contract for a select group of association endorsed workers compensation programs which had over twenty years of profitable underwriting experience  the implementation of an excess liability program for public entities with a twenty year profitable track record  the return of profitable programs  the impact of an overall rate increase achieved in  and an overall rate increase in this increase was partially offset by the anticipated reduction in managed fee revenue from two limited duration or closed end administrative services and claims contracts 
as previously indicated  during  we accelerated the recognition of million in deferred claim revenue related to a multi state claims run off service contract 
the acceleration of this revenue was a result of the earlier than anticipated termination of the contracts 
these contracts were terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of at the time of termination  we had million of deferred revenue related to the claims contract 
the revenue had been paid to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule 
however  we had previously adopted a more conservative revenue recognition pattern  which was consistent with our historically claims handling pattern  therefore  resulting in the establishment of deferred revenue 
at the termination of the contract  pursuant to the contract terms  we were no longer obligated to handle the related claims 
specialty risk management operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations for our specialty risk management operations in thousands for the years ended december  revenue net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains total revenue pre tax income specialty risk management operations our specialty risk management operations now exclude an allocation of corporate overhead  which is attributable to our agency operations 
prior to january   corporate overhead was only reflected in the specialty risk management operations segment 
this reclassification for the allocation of corporate overhead more accurately presents our segments as a result of improved cost allocation information 
as a result  the segment information for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to reflect this allocation 
for the years ended december    and  the allocation of corporate overhead from the specialty risk management operations to the agency operations segment was million  million  and million  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in addition to the reclassification for the allocation of corporate overhead as described above  we reclassified and revenues related to the conversion of a west coast commercial transportation program  which was converted to a specialty risk program with one of our subsidiaries  from the agency operations segment to the specialty risk management operations segment 
accordingly  the agency operations revenue and intersegment revenue have been reclassified 
in addition  the overall net income related to this subsidiary was reclassified from the agency operations to the specialty risk management operations segment 
as a result  pre tax net income of million and million related to this subsidiary was reclassified to the specialty risk management operations pre tax income from the agency operations segment for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we accelerated the recognition of million in deferred claim revenue  as a result of an earlier than anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
these contracts had been terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of had the contract not been terminated  we would have received additional claims fee revenue for continued claims handling services 
compared to revenues from specialty risk management operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects our controlled growth of premiums written  as well as the favorable impact from an increase in our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties 
management fees increased  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in management fees were impacted by an anticipated shift in fee for service revenue previously generated from a third party contract to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
due to the earlier than anticipated termination of this third party contract  the revenues that we anticipated earning in were accelerated into the third quarter of excluding revenue generated from this third party contract  management fee revenue increased approximately million  or  in comparison to this increase is primarily the result of a new florida based program implemented in the second quarter of  as well as growth in a specific existing new england based program 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this decrease reflects a similar anticipated shifting of revenue previously generated from a multi state claims run off service contract  to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
also impacting this comparison was the effect of the earlier than anticipated termination of the third party contract  which caused the revenues that we anticipated earning in to be accelerated into the third quarter of excluding revenue generated from this third party contract  claim fee revenue would have remained relatively consistent in comparison to net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from underwriting activities and growth in gross written premiums during and  as well as net proceeds from capital raised in and through the issuances of debentures 
the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was and current after tax book yield was 
specialty risk management operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the year ended december  this increase in pre tax income demonstrates a continued improvement in underwriting results as a result of our controlled growth in premium volume and our continued focus on leveraging of fixed costs 
offsetting a portion of this year over year improvement  was a million pre tax benefit  recognized in the third quarter of  from the previously mentioned acceleration of revenue recognition  net of expenses  relating to the meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
this overall improvement in the loss and lae ratio reflects the impact of earned premiums from the controlled growth of profitable programs which have had favorable underwriting experience  as well as our intended shift in the balance from workers compensation to the general liability line of business 
historically  the general liability line of business has a lower loss ratio and a higher external producer commission 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
in addition  there was a percentage point decrease in the net loss and lae ratio as a result of efficiencies realized within our claims handling activities 
development on prior accident year reserves  added million  or percentage points  to net loss and lae in  compared to million or percentage points in the development on prior accident years in comparison to was the result of an increase of  or percentage points  related to one specific workers compensation claim 
this claim exceeded our then applicable million per claimant limit in our workers compensation treaty and is now reserved at million 
in addition  the development on prior accident years was also attributable to an increase to an exposure allowance of million  specific to reinsurance recoverables for a discontinued surety program and a discontinued workers compensation program 
during  in relation to the discontinued surety program  we received updated financial information from the liquidator of the reinsurer on that program 
based upon this information  we increased the allowance to of the uncollateralized exposure as of june  in relation to the discontinued workers compensation program  we received updated information relating to the collectibility of this asset 
as a result  we increased our exposure allowance to of the uncollateralized exposure as of december  although  we increased our allowance for these specific exposures  the actual exposures did not increase 
the remaining million of development represents of net reserves at december  our accident year loss ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in the accident year loss and lae ratio is the unconsolidated gaap loss and lae ratio  excluding development on prior accident years 
our expense ratio for the years ended december  and was 
this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
our expense ratio was impacted by an anticipated increase in gross external commissions  due to the shift in the balance between workers compensation and general liability 
the general liability line of business has a higher external producer commission rate and  as previously indicated  a lower loss ratio 
offsetting these increases to the expense ratio was the impact of the leveraging of fixed costs 
compared to revenues from specialty risk management operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects the earning pattern resulting from the controlled growth of programs written in management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in management fees reflects an anticipated shift in fee for service revenue previously generated from a third party contract to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued excluding revenue generated from this third party contract  management fee revenue increased approximately million in comparison to this increase is primarily the result of growth in specific programs in nebraska  minnesota  and new england 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this decrease reflects a similar anticipated shifting of revenue previously generated from a multi state claims run off service contract  to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
offsetting this anticipated reduction is the previously mentioned million in deferred revenue recognized during the third quarter of related to the multi state claims run off service contract 
excluding revenue previously generated from this contract and the revenue recognized due to the termination of this contract  claim fee revenue increased  in comparison to this increase is primarily the result of growth in claims handling revenue in new england 
net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from underwriting activities and growth in gross written premiums during and  as well as  net proceeds from capital raised through the issuance of debentures in and the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was and current after tax book yield was 
the decline in investment yield reflects the accelerated prepayment speeds in mortgage backed securities and the reinvestment of cash flows in municipal bonds and other securities with lower interest rates 
over the past two years  the reinvestment of cash flows has shifted from maturing securities with higher yields being replaced by securities with lower yields in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  the decline in investment yield reflects the timing of investing the proceeds from the capital raised in specialty risk management operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in this increase in pre tax income demonstrates improvement in underwriting results and the further leveraging of fixed costs as we continue to experience controlled growth of premium volume 
in addition  this improvement in pre tax income reflects an approximate million pre tax favorable impact in relation to the previously mentioned acceleration of deferred claim revenue  net of related expenses  relating to the termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premium 
the improvement in the loss and lae ratio reflects the impact of earned premium on profitable programs from the controlled growth in programs with profitable underwriting experience  the impact of rate increases in and  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in reinsurance costs 
these improvements were partially offset by the effect of a commutation of the and surplus relief reinsurance agreement and a reclassification between losses and expenses on one inactive program 
the impact of these settlements resulted in an increase to the loss and lae ratio of percentage points and a corresponding percentage point decrease to the gaap expense ratio 
the loss ratio reflects an increase in net ultimates of million  of which million is from the previously mentioned commutation and reclassification 
the remaining million  or of million  is from a small number of old claims in an isolated group of programs 
our expense ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premium 
as mentioned above  the commutation and the reclassification meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued had a favorable impact of percentage points 
partially offsetting this favorable impact was the anticipated increase in gross outside commissions 
this is a result of a shift in the balance between workers compensation and general liability 
the general liability line of business has a higher commission rate and a lower loss ratio 
agency operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations from our agency operations in thousands for the years ended december  net commission pre tax income we reclassified and revenues related to the conversion of a west coast commercial transportation program  which was converted to a specialty risk program with one of our subsidiaries  from the agency operations segment to the specialty risk management operations segment 
accordingly  the agency operations revenue and intersegment revenue have been reclassified 
in addition  the overall net income related to this subsidiary was reclassified from the agency operations to the specialty risk management operations segment 
as a result  pre tax net income of million and million related to this subsidiary was reclassified to the specialty risk management operations pre tax income from the agency operations segment for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our agency operations include an allocation of corporate overhead  which includes expenses associated with accounting  information services  legal  and other corporate services 
the corporate overhead allocation excludes those expenses specific to the holding company 
prior to january   corporate overhead was only reflected in the specialty risk management operations segment 
this reclassification for the allocation of corporate overhead more accurately presents our segments as a result of improved cost allocation information 
as a result  the segment information for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to reflect this allocation 
for the years ended december    and  the allocation of corporate overhead to the agency operations segment was million  million  and million  respectively 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of profit sharing commissions received in the first and third quarter of in addition  the agency operations experienced an increase in new business and renewal retentions in comparison to  which was partially offset by a reduction in renewal rates 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the improvement in the pre tax margin is primarily attributable to the overall increase in commissions and leveraging of fixed costs 
excluding fixed costs and the allocation of corporate overhead  all other expenses remained relatively consistent 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commissions  increased  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of increases in new business  rate increases  higher retention levels  and profit sharing commissions 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the improvement in the pre tax margin is primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenue

management s discussion and analysis continued other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum reserve maximum reserve line of business range range selected reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and for the year ended december   we reported an increase in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december  the increase in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during the major components of this change in ultimate loss estimates are as follows in thousands incurred losses paid losses reserves at reserves at december  current prior total current prior total december  line of business year years incurred year years paid workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated re estimated reserves at development as reserves at december  a percentage of december  on prior year line of business prior years reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other sub total residual markets total net reserves workers compensation excluding residual markets the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business  excluding residual markets  increased million  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this net overall increase reflects decreases of million  million  and  in the ultimate loss estimate for accident years   and  respectively 
the decrease in the ultimate loss estimate reflects better than expected experience on most of our workers compensation programs 
average severity on reported claims did not increase as much as anticipated in the prior actuarial projections  therefore ultimate loss estimates were reduced 
in addition  there was a reallocation of loss reserves of million from accident year to accident year to align the incurred but not reported ibnr reserves with case reserves for a specific tennessee program 
these net overall decreases were more than offset by increases of million  million  and million in accident years   and  respectively 
these increases are the result of higher than expected emergence of claim activity primarily related to a specific workers compensation claim  as well as the aforementioned reallocation in the tennessee program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued commercial multiple peril general liability the commercial multiple peril line and general liability line of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves 
the net increase reflects a reduction of  in the ultimate loss estimate for accident year the improvement in the accident year reflected better than expected claim emergence on several programs 
the decreases in the and accident years were million and  respectively 
these decreases reflect the impact of a reclassification from the general liability line of business to the commercial automobile line of business 
this reclassification of million was the result of actual claims emergence on three commercial automobile claims that are subject to our core casualty reinsurance program 
prior to the actual claims emergence the reserves for this exposure were carried in the general liability reinsurance line of business as ibnr 
these decreases were offset by increases of   and  in accident years   and  respectively 
the increase in the accident year loss ratio reflects slightly higher than expected emergence of claim activity in several different programs 
the increases in the and accident years reflect slightly higher than expected emergence of claim activity in two discontinued programs 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business increased million  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall increase reflects increases of   and  in accident years   and  respectively 
these increases reflect the impact of the three claims mentioned in the above commercial multiple peril and general liability section  which also reflects a reallocation by accident year 
the reserves also reflect higher than expected emergence of claim activity in an inactive program 
these increases were partially offset by reductions of  and  in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years and  respectively 
the accident year reduction reflected better than expected claim emergence from a commercial automobile program in california 
average severity on reported claims did not increase as much as anticipated in the prior actuarial projections  therefore ultimate loss estimates were reduced 
the accident year reduction reflects the reallocation in ibnr on a discontinued program mentioned above 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
other the other lines of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net reserves on the other lines of business 
this net increase reflects an increase in the exposure allowance for potential unrecoverable reinsurance of  related to a specific discontinued surety program 
during the year  we received updated information from the liquidator of the reinsurer on that program 
based upon this information  we increased the allowance to cover all of the uncollateralized exposure as of june  the net increase also reflects an increase of  in accident year from higher than expected emergence of claim activity in a few different programs 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of  or of net reserves on the workers compensation residual market line of business 
the change reflects an increase of  in accident year  offset by decreases of  and  in accident years and  respectively 
we record loss reserves as reported by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  plus an estimate for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the quarter 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
salary and employee benefits and other administrative expenses salary and employee benefits decreased  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in performance and profit based variable compensation  as a result of raising the performance targets for achievement 
this decrease was partially offset by merit increases for associates 
in addition  this decrease was partially due to a slight reduction in staffing levels in comparison to as a result of our expense control initiatives 
salary and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects both merit increases and the accrual of anticipated variable compensation  which is directly tied to performance and profitability 
these increases were partially offset by a slight reduction in staffing levels 
other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase is primarily attributable to consulting and audit expenses associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as increases in expenses as the result of information technology enhancements 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of overall refinements in our estimation for allowances on bad debt 
the increase in other administrative expenses was also offset by our overall expense control initiatives 
other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in policyholder dividends for as opposed to a million reduction in anticipated policyholder dividends reflected in  due to management s evaluation of the appropriateness of dividend payments in conjunction with overall underwriting results 
partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in overall bad debt expense in as compared to increases in related allowances recorded in on previously discontinued programs 
salary and employee benefits and other administrative expenses include both corporate overhead and the holding company expenses included in the reconciling items of our segment information 
interest expense interest expense for   and was million  million  and  respectively 
interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures and current lines of credit  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis 
interest expense increased million as a result of the senior debentures issued in the second quarter of and the junior subordinated debentures issued in the third quarter of  as well as an overall increase in the average interest rates 
interest expense related to our lines of credit remained relatively consistent in comparison to this is the result of a decrease in the average outstanding balance  offset by an increase in the average interest rate 
the average outstanding balance was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the average interest rate  excluding the debentures  was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense  which includes both federal and state taxes  for  and  was million  million  and million  or  and of income before taxes  respectively 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a  increase in the deferred tax asset relating to the increase in the statutory federal tax rate from to 
in addition  our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a shift towards increasing investments in tax exempt securities in an effort meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued to maximize after tax investment yields 
our current taxes are calculated using a statutory rate based upon taxable income greater than million 
deferred taxes are calculated based on a statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds  which include both regulated and non regulated cash flows  are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets  risk management fees  and agency commissions 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholder dividends  share repurchases  and debt service 
our regulated sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  and proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets 
these regulated funds are used for the payment of claims  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses  and taxes relating to the regulated portion of net income

in addition  the decrease in cash flow from operations is the result of variable compensation payments made in the first quarter of  related to performance and profitability and a decrease in cash as a result of tax payments 
in addition to the changes described above in relation to our cash provided by operations  we had an increase in cash used in investing activities as a result of an million cash payment for our new corporate headquarters in the first quarter of the proceeds from the issuance of debentures  which are described below  were used for the purchase of our new building

meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued compared to regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in regulated cash flow from operations primarily reflects growth in written premiums and overall improved underwriting results 
non regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in non regulated cash flow from operations primarily reflects the inflow of cash related to the previously mentioned limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts  which were entered into at the beginning of at inception  these contracts resulted in a higher inflow of cash 
as anticipated  for the duration of the remaining life of the contracts  there would be a decrease in the associated inflow of cash in comparison to prior periods 
in addition  the decrease in cash flow from operations was the result of intercompany tax payments made during to the regulated subsidiaries in accordance with the tax sharing agreement 
these intercompany tax payments were made to compensate the regulated subsidiaries for the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
these intercompany tax payments also contributed to the increase in regulated cash flow from operations 
although the non regulated cash flow from operations significantly decreased in comparison to  which was mainly the result of timing variances associated with the inflow of cash  net income  excluding interest  depreciation  and amortization  increased million in comparison to this improvement reflects the acceleration of the previously mentioned deferred revenue recognition  net of expenses  relating to the earlier than anticipated termination of the two limited duration administrative services and claims run off contracts 
in addition  this improvement reflects an increase in intercompany fees from growth in risk bearing programs

meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the revolving line of credit provides for interest at a variable rate based  at our option  upon either a prime based rate or libor based rate 
in addition  the revolving line of credit also provides for an unused facility fee 
on prime based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points below prime 
on libor based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points above libor 
the margin for all loans is dependent on the sum of non regulated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash impairment charges related to intangible assets for the preceding four quarters  plus dividends paid or payable to us from subsidiaries during such period adjusted ebitda

management s discussion and analysis continued a significant portion of our consolidated assets represent assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that at this time  without prior approval of the state of michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis  cannot be transferred to us in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to us from the insurance company subsidiaries is regulated by michigan insurance statutes which  in general  are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance company subsidiaries surplus 
based upon the statutory financial statements  star may only pay dividends to us during with the prior approval of ofis 
star s earned surplus position at december  was negative million 
at december   earned surplus was negative million 
no dividends were paid in or our insurance company subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years  to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively

the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus and asset valuation reserve  to its risk based capital 
at december   all of the insurance company subsidiaries were in compliance with rbc requirements 
star reported statutory surplus of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the calculated rbc was million in and million in the threshold requiring the minimum regulatory involvement was million in and million in the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated certain ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons for these variations are set forth below ratio usual range value company star investment yield liabilities to liquid assets under company savers change in net writings company williamsburg change in net writings gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under company ameritrust change in net writings the low investment yield is affected by an interest environment where rates are still relatively low 
during march  star transferred million in invested assets to its subsidiaries pursuant to an intercompany reinsurance agreement 
as a result of this transfer  the average invested assets used in the calculation were higher than the monthly weighted average 
monthly weighted average invested assets would produce a yield of 
also contributing to the low yield was a shift in investment strategy toward greater allocation to municipal bonds  which have lower yields than taxable bonds 
the liabilities to liquid assets ratio increase to was primarily related to the transfer by star of million in invested bond assets to its subsidiaries pursuant to an intercompany reinsurance agreement  which therefore reduced liquid assets 
ceded premium payables increased million as a result of the intercompany pooling activity 
excluding the effect of intercompany pooling  the ratio would have been  below the threshold of 
also contributing to the high ratio was an increase in the provision for reinsurance of million in effective january   the insurance company subsidiaries began participating in an intercompany reinsurance agreement  whereby each participating affiliate cedes of its business to star 
thereafter  star cedes to each participating affiliate based on their respective participation percentages  from which each affiliate has agreed to reinsure star 
excluding the intercompany pooling activity  the change in net writings ratio would have been within the normal range for in addition  savers ratio was impacted by an increase of million in commercial multi peril written premium for as a result of retention of existing business and new business 
the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on williamsburg was impacted by the previously mentioned intercompany reinsurance agreement 
williamsburg s assumed premium receivable increased million as a result of intercompany pooling activity 
although savers and ameritrust experienced a significant increase in such balances  the results remained within the usual range 
excluding the intercompany pooling activity  this ratio would have been within the usual range for in april  we announced an upgrade from am best of certain of our insurance company subsidiaries from b very good  with a positive outlook to b very good 
the ratings upgrade applies to star  savers property and casualty insurance company  and williamsburg national insurance company 
additionally  am best reaffirmed the rating for ameritrust insurance corporation as b very good  with a positive outlook 
we believe that as we continue to show improvement in our balance sheet and operating performance our rating will remain at least at its current level  if not at an upgraded level 
however  there can be no assurance that am best will not change its rating of our insurance company subsidiaries in the future 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective and existing risk sharing partners 
we customarily collateralize reinsurance balances due from non admitted reinsurers through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables other than those balances related to connecticut surety company csc and hih america compensation liability company hih  as well as  reliance national indemnity company reliance  for which allowances have been established 
the following table sets forth information relating to our five largest reinsurers other than client captive quota share reinsurers as of december  reinsurance premium ceded reinsurance recoverable am best reinsurer december  december  rating in thousands in thousands employers reinsurance corporation   a motors insurance company   a aspen insurance uk ltd 
  a general reinsurance company   a munich american reinsurance   a we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential exposure to uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
the following table sets forth our exposure to uncollectible reinsurance and related allowances for the years ending december  and in thousands gross exposure collateral or other security allowance net exposure during  in relation to a discontinued surety program  we received updated financial information from the liquidator of the reinsurer on that program 
based upon this information  we increased the allowance to of the uncollateralized exposure as of june  in relation to a discontinued workers compensation program  we received updated information relating to the collectibility of the asset 
as a result  we increased our exposure allowance to of the uncollateralized exposure as of december  although  we increased our allowance for these specific exposures  the actual exposures did not increase 
while we believe this allowance to be adequate  no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations

management s discussion and analysis continued intercompany pooling agreement intercompany pooling agreements are commonly entered into between affiliated insurance companies  so as to allow the companies to utilize the capital and surplus of all of the companies  rather than each individual company 
under pooling arrangements  companies share in the insurance business that is underwritten and allocate the combined premium  losses and related expenses between the companies within the pooling arrangement 
effective january   the insurance company subsidiaries entered into an inter company reinsurance agreement the pooling agreement 
this pooling agreement includes star  ameritrust insurance corporation ameritrust  savers property and casualty insurance company savers and williamsburg national insurance company williamsburg 
pursuant to the pooling agreement  savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to cede to star and star has agreed to reinsure of the liabilities and expenses of savers  ameritrust and williamsburg  relating to all insurance and reinsurance policies issued by them 
in return  star agrees to cede and savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to reinsure star for their respective percentages of the liabilities and expenses of star 
the pooling agreement was filed with the applicable regulatory authorities 
any changes to the pooling agreement must be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements in june  we entered into a guaranty agreement with a bank 
we are guaranteeing payment of a million term loan issued by the bank to an unaffiliated insurance agency 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  we are obligated to pay any outstanding principal up to a maximum of million  as well as any accrued interest on the loan  and any costs incurred by the bank in the collection process 
in exchange for our guaranty  the president and member of the insurance agency pledged of the common shares of two other insurance agencies that he wholly owns 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  we have the right to sell any or all of the pledged insurance agencies common shares and use the proceeds from the sale to recover any amounts paid under the guaranty agreement 
any excess proceeds would be paid to the president and member of the insurance agency who is the sole shareholder 
as of december   no liability has been recorded with respect to our obligations under the guaranty agreement  since no premium exists in excess of the guaranteed amount 
on january   the unaffiliated insurance agency paid off the term loan in full 
as such  our legal obligations under the guaranty agreement terminated 
convertible note in july  we made a million loan  at an effective interest rate equal to the three month libor  plus  to an unaffiliated insurance agency 
in december  we loaned an additional million to the unaffiliated insurance agency 
the original million demand note was replaced with a million convertible note 
the effective interest rate of the convertible note is equal to the three month libor  plus and is due december  this agency has been a producer for us for over ten years 
as security for the loan  the borrower granted us a security interest in its accounts  cash  general intangibles  and other intangible property 
also  the shareholder then pledged of the common shares of three insurance agencies  the common shares owned by the shareholder in another agency  and has executed a personal guaranty 
this note is convertible upon our option based upon a pre determined formula  beginning in the conversion feature of this note is considered an embedded derivative pursuant to sfas no 
 and therefore is accounted for separately from the note 
at december   the estimated fair value of the derivative is zero

management s discussion and analysis continued recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
commencing in the first quarter of  we began expensing the fair value of all stock options granted since january  under the prospective method 
we have not issued stock options to employees since under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the retroactive methods would record compensation expense beginning with the first period restated for all unvested stock options and restricted stock 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that delays the compliance dates for sfas r 
under the new rule  sfas r is effective for public companies for annual  rather than interim periods  which begin after june  therefore  we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of  or beginning january  we have evaluated the requirements of sfas r and have determined the impact on our financial statements related to existing stock options is immaterial 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas replaces the mentioned pronouncements and changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in an accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
however  when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  however  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement was issued 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas  as applicable  beginning in the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts  effective for contract replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  the sop defines an internal replacement of an insurance contract as a modification in product features  rights  or coverages that occurs by the exchange of an existing contract for a new contract  or by amendment endorsement  or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage with a contract 
insurance contracts meeting this replacement criteria should be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract 
we will review the guidance during and determine the applicability to any of our various insurance contracts

management s discussion and analysis continued related party transactions at december  and  respectively  we held an  and  note receivable  including  of accrued interest at december   from one of our executive officers 
accrued interest at december  was  this note arose from a transaction in late in which we loaned the officer funds to exercise  common stock options to cover the exercise price and the taxes incurred as a result of the exercise 
the note bears interest equal to our borrowing rate and is due on demand any time after january  the loan is partially collateralized by  shares of our common stock under a stock pledge agreement 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  have been paid against the loan 
on june   the officer entered into an employment agreement which provides the note is a non recourse loan and our sole legal remedy in the event of a default is the right to reclaim the shares pledged under the stock pledge agreement 
as of december   the cumulative amount that has been paid against this loan was  refer to note related party transaction for further information 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and five years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of  compared to at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio was million 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
during and  we continue to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our return to profitability and our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are rounded and in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps market value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed annual interest expense by  in october  we entered into two interest rate swap transactions with lasalle bank lasalle to mitigate our interest rate risk on million and million of our senior debentures and trust preferred securities  respectively 
we recognized these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as a cash flow hedge and are deemed a highly effective transaction under sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and any changes in their fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is being accrued and is being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by  at december   we had million outstanding 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by
