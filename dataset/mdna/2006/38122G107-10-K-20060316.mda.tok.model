item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations for each of the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunication and internet services in major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states cis 
we offer voice  data and internet services to corporations  operators and consumers using our metropolitan overlay network in major cities throughout russia  ukraine  kazakhstan  and uzbekistan  and via leased channels and intercity fiber optic and satellite based networks  including approximately access points in russia and other countries of the cis 
in addition  we offer mobile services in the ukrainian cities of kiev and odessa 
we organize our operations into four business segments  as follows business and corporate services bcs 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide business and corporate services including voice and data services to corporate clients across all geographical markets and all industry segments  other than telecommunications operators  carrier and operator services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide a range of carrier and operator services including voice and data services to foreign and russian telecommunications and mobile operators  consumer internet services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks  we provide internet access to the consumer market and web content offered through a family of internet portals throughout russia  ukraine  kazakhstan  and uzbekistan  and mobile services 
using our mobile networks in kiev and odessa  ukraine  we provide mobile services with value added features  such as voicemail  roaming and messaging services on a subscription and prepaid basis 
we intend  wherever possible  to offer all of our integrated telecommunication services under the golden telecom brand  although  some services still carry local brands because of recent acquisitions 
our dial up internet services are distributed under the rol brand in russia  kazakhstan and uzbekistan and under the svit on line brand in ukraine 
most of our revenue is derived from high volume business customers and carriers 
our business customers include large multi national companies  local enterprises  financial institutions  hotels and government agencies 
we also believe that carriers derive a portion of their business from high volume business customers 
thus  we believe that the majority of our ultimate end users are businesses that require access to highly reliable and advanced telecommunications facilities to sustain their operations 
traditionally  we have competed for customers on the basis of network quality  customer service and range of services offered 
in the past several years  other telecommunications operators have also introduced high quality services to the segments of the business market in which we operate 
competition with these operators is intense  and frequently results in declining prices for some of our services  which adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  some of our competitors do not link their prices to the united states dollar usd ruble exchange rate  so when the ruble devalues  their prices effectively become lower in relation to our prices  which are mostly set in usd 
the ruble exchange rate with the usd has become relatively stable since early and has slightly appreciated during the three year period ending december   so price pressures associated with devaluation have eased considerably 
we cannot be certain that the exchange rate will remain stable in the future and therefore we may experience additional price pressures 
in  we continued to experience growth in our main lines of business and to benefit from strong macro economic growth in the markets where we operate 
we successfully implemented our federal transit network ftn in to comply with the new laws and regulations on intercity long distance services that came into effect on january  despite being faced with challenges of continued changes in the regulatory and telecommunications environment in russia and ukraine  we remained focused on developing our business through organic growth  acquisitions  and the expansion of our services 

table of contents recent acquisitions we continue to pursue consolidation opportunities through selective acquisitions that will allow us to expand our geographical reach  add to our service offerings  and improve our market share while maintaining operational control 
our recent acquisitions have enabled us to realize new opportunities in major cities in the russian regions by increasing our customer base  increasing our access to critical infrastructure including such as last mile  and furthering our consumer broadband strategy in moscow  st 
petersburg  and other cities in russia 
described below are our acquisitions occurring in and refer to note in the financial statements included in item of this report for more details about acquisitions occurring in   and in february  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in st holding sro st holding  a czech company that owns plus one share in zao samara telecom  a telecommunications service provider in samara  russia  from zao smarts and individual owners for cash consideration of approximately million in cash 
in april  we completed the acquisition of of the common shares in oao balticom mobile balticom that owns of zao westbalt telecom  an alternative telecommunications operator in kaliningrad  russia  for cash consideration of approximately million 
in april  we completed the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in ooo uralrelcom that we did not own for cash consideration of approximately million 
in may  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in sp buzton buzton  an alternative telecommunications operator in uzbekistan  for cash consideration of approximately million 
in march  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in ooo dicom dicom  an early stage wireless broadband enterprise  for approximately million in cash 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we entered into a participants agreement which provided the seller with a put option that  if exercised  would require us to purchase the seller s interest at fair market value 
the participants agreement provided us with a call option that  if exercised  would require the seller to sell after february   its interest in dicom at any time beginning after february   if dicom s valuation exceeds targeted levels by february  in september  we completed the acquisition of of ooo joint venture sakhalin telecom limited sakhalin telecom  a fixed line alternative operator in the far east region of russia for approximately million in cash 
as a result of this acquisition and combined with our previous ownership interest  we now own of sakhalin telecom 
in october  we completed the acquisition of of antel rascom ltd  a british virgin islands company that owns a interest in zao rascom rascom  for million in cash 
in november  antel rascom ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired an additional of rascom for million in cash  raising our total ownership interest to 
although we now have a majority voting interest  we account for rascom using the equity method due to certain participating rights of minority shareholders 
rascom has infrastructure and facilities in the moscow and st 
petersburg regions and elsewhere in northwest russia 
in october  we completed the acquisition of of zao sochitelecom sochitelecom  a fixed line alternative operator in the krasnodar region of russia for a total purchase price of million consisting of cash consideration of million and million  currently recorded as a liability  to be settled in cash upon the satisfactory achievement of certain conditions 
in march  we expensed approximately million in external legal  financial and consulting fees related to an acquisition opportunity that we decided not to pursue  including advisory fees of approximately million paid to an affiliate of alfa telecom limited  one of our significant shareholders 
in september  we expensed approximately million in external legal  financial and consulting fees related to the previously announced acquisition of hudson telecom  inc and its subsidiaries  which we decided not to pursue 
regulatory developments on january   a new law on communications the telecommunications law came into effect in russia 
while some of the supporting regulations to implement the telecommunications law have not been enacted  the russian government approved in march new rules for interconnection the interconnection rules that became effective on january  these interconnection rules contemplate a new three layer interconnection system consisting of domestic long distance international long distance dld ild  zonal  and local operators 
under this new structure  end users will have the right to choose a long distance operator  and dld ild operators will be required to have interconnection points in each of the constituent territories of the russian federation 
in addition  the telecommunications law created a universal service fund usf charge  which became effective may   calculated as of revenue from services provided to customers  excluding interconnection and other operators traffic routing revenue 
we have incurred approximately million in russian federation usf charges for may through december however  on february   the constitutional court of the russian 
table of contents federation ruled that the provisions of the telecommunications law relating to the usf charge do not comply with the constitution of the russian federation and shall become null and void as of january   unless the telecommunications law is amended prior to that date 
the constitutional court established that essential criteria of the charge  including the maximum rate and basis of calculation  must be established by law and not by the government 
we continue to have regular dialogue about these current regulatory issues with the ministry of information technologies and communications of the russian federation the russian ministry of telecommunications 
on may   we received a dld ild license in russia valid until may  we are required under the license to begin providing services and fulfil the network requirements specified in the interconnection rules not later than may  on january   we announced that the construction of our ftn was complete in compliance with the telecommunications law and our dld ild license 
to date  we are one of two alternative operators who have complied with these requirements 
the ftn consists of four international communications transit nodes  seven intercity communications transit nodes deployed in each federal district of russia  and connection points or ftn access nodes located in each constituent territory of russia 
we have obtained the required governmental permissions for operation of all the international and intercity communications transit nodes that are part of the ftn 
although construction of the connection points has been completed  we are awaiting formal commissioning by rossvyaznadzor  a governmental body that reports to the russian ministry of telecommunications and is responsible for the control and the supervision of information technology and communications as well as for commissioning the long distance networks 
additionally  we learned informally on march   that codes of access to our long distance services that are part of the approval to operate our ftn were granted 
the access codes for customers to access our services are to be for our ild service and for our dld service 
according to remarks made by the russian minister of telecommunications  we are currently one of only two alternative operators which have begun active work under new the dld ild licenses 
procedurally  once the ministry of justice of the russian federation has registered the order of the russian minister of telecommunications to grant ftn access codes to us  that decision will officially be published 
registration by the ministry of justice is expected shortly 
on october   the russian government enacted the rules on price establishment for interconnection and traffic routing 
these rules list interconnection services and traffic routing services provided by the incumbent operators that are subject to pricing regulation by the government 
the effective utilization and implementation of the russian long distance license is subject to and dependent upon pending establishment of tariffs for interconnection and traffic routing services to be provided by incumbent oao svyazinvest svyazinvest state owned companies 
such tariffs are to be established by rossvyaznadzor  and in the absence of such regulated tariffs the incumbent svyazinvest companies may attempt to impose their independently established tariffs on alternative long distance operators 
the tariffs will be paid by long distance operators to the incumbent svyazinvest local and zonal operators for each minute of long distance traffic that is carried such that all long distance operators will be cross subsidizing the local and zonal network of the svyazinvest companies 
however  to minimize the impact of such payments to the incumbent companies  we have received licenses to provide zonal services in all the regions of the russian federation  and we are developing plans to construct zonal networks in selected regions 
we believe that our dld ild license will enable us to protect our relationship with our corporate clients and  in the long term  expand our business into the residential long distance market 
we currently anticipate that our new license will result in an increase of dld ild revenues since we will begin to earn long distance revenue directly from end users 
in the previous system  the incumbent svyazinvest companies collected full tariffs for dld ild calls and passed only a portion of the revenue to the dld ild operator 
however  in the near term  we do not expect significant growth in our dld ild gross margins since we will incur additional costs payable to the incumbent svyazinvest companies in the form of compensatory fees and other surcharges 
dld ild carriers will continue to pay this compensatory fee until local tariffs are raised to an economically viable level 
this increase in local tariffs is expected to be completed by under the new system  the incumbent svyazinvest companies may also act as agents for dld ild carriers  billing clients for long distance calls and collecting payments on behalf of the dld ild operators 
we are still analyzing these future dld ild revenues to determine the impact on our business and how these will be classified for segment reporting purposes 
on march   the russian president approved amendments to the telecommunications law that would introduce calling party pays rules cpp rules 
effective july   under the cpp rules  all incoming calls  on fixed and mobile lines  in russia will be free of charge  and only the fixed line or mobile operators originating the call may charge the customer for the call 
currently  subscribers of fixed line telephones do not pay for incoming calls and  therefore  the cpp rules will not have an impact on fixed to fixed line calls  but the cpp rules will impact the fixed to mobile calls as mobile companies traditionally charged for incoming calls in russia 
on september   the national commission for communication s regulation in ukraine issued an international license ukrainian international license to golden telecom ukraine gtu 
the ukrainian international license allows gtu to provide international telecommunications services throughout all of ukraine  allows the leasing of channels to third parties  and increases gtu s potential as an international telecommunications carrier 
in february  we received notice from vimpelcom  our largest customer  that it was diverting a volume of traffic away from our network due to their preliminary interpretation of traffic routing regulations issued by the russian ministry of 
table of contents telecommunications 
however  in the third quarter of  vimpelcom traffic volumes were restored to their previous levels as a result of our discussions with vimpelcom and clarification from the regulatory agencies 
in june  another carrier expressed its intentions to divert a portion of its traffic from our network 
this diversion of traffic resulted in a decrease of average monthly revenues of approximately million 
we do not expect this carrier to reduce their traffic volumes further in the foreseeable future 
however  revenues from carriers and operators are by nature volatile and can fluctuate significantly between periods 
early in the second quarter of  gtu suffered a significant decrease in outgoing international traffic revenue from one of our largest customers  ukrainian mobile communications umc 
the loss was expected since umc had obtained an international carrier license in the third quarter of this change in routing resulted in our quarterly umc international outgoing traffic revenues decreasing from million in the first quarter of to negligible amounts in the second  third  and fourth quarters of we do not anticipate the reinstatement of this umc revenue from outgoing international traffic since the international carrier license allows umc to interconnect directly with international carriers 
other developments prior to the second quarter of  we recorded estimates for unused vacation based on the average salary levels of our employees and total days of unused vacation of employees 
during the second quarter of  we revised estimates for unused vacation based on the actual daily salary and unused vacation of each employee 
management determined that this methodology results in a more accurate estimate of the amount of our obligation for unused vacation 
the change in accounting estimate decreased net income for the year ended december  by approximately million  net of tax  including the associated payroll taxes  equivalent to per common share basic and per common share diluted 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we incurred approximately million in employee termination costs primarily related to the departure of our former chief operating officer  chief financial officer  and other senior employees 
we may continue to incur such costs in as we continue to streamline our operations and integrate newly acquired subsidiaries 
in september  we granted stock appreciation rights sars to our chief executive officer ceo with respect to  shares of our common stock  at a share price which was the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on july  ceo granting share price  which was  one third of which shall be and become vested and nonforfeitable on each of the first three anniversary dates from september   provided the ceo remains continuously employed by us until each such relevant date 
if  prior to august  and during the ceo s period of employment with us  the average closing stock price of one share of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  or any such other exchange on which the our common stock may then be traded  exceeds during any thirty day consecutive period  the ceo will be granted sars for an additional  shares of our common stock at the ceo granting share price  which sars shall be fully vested upon issuance 
the sars provide for a cash only settlement and the related obligation is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
in december  we granted sars with respect to  shares of our common stock to senior management and other employees 
the sars were granted pursuant to the golden telecom  inc stock appreciation rights plan and the edn sovintel stock appreciation rights bonus plan at a share price which is the lower of i the average between the high and low sales price per share of the of common stock on the grant date  or in case no such sale takes place on grant date  the last date on which a sale occurred or ii the average closing sales price per share of our common stock for the fourteen trading days immediately preceding such date  which was granting share price 
seventy five percent of the sar grant shall be subject to time vesting  one third of which shall be and become vested and nonforfeitable on each of the first three anniversary dates from december   provided that the employee remains continuously employed by the company until each such relevant date 
the granting share price shall increase by five percent on each anniversary date after december   in association with the sars that shall be and become vested and nonforfeitable on each such anniversary date 
twenty five percent of the sars granted are subject to performance vesting upon the our common stock achieving a closing trading price of at least per share for thirty consecutive days as determined in the sole discretion of the company 
if the company s common stock does not achieve a closing trading price of at least per share for thirty consecutive days within three years of the date of grant  such portion of the sars shall expire by its terms and shall not be exercisable 
the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be issued pursuant to the golden telecom  inc stock appreciation rights plan at the discretion of the grantees shall be  shares 
the remainder of the sars provides for a cash settlement 
the related obligation is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
in july  our board of directors adopted a long term incentive bonus program ltibp for senior management of the company  effective as of january  in february  our board of directors discontinued the ltibp effective january  during the year ended december  we did not record any expense associated with the ltibp 
we have not granted any shares under the ltibp 

table of contents highlights and outlook since early we have witnessed a recovery in the russian market  but downward pricing pressures persist from increased competition and the global trend toward lower telecommunications tariffs 
in and  our traffic volume increases exceeded the reduction in tariffs on certain types of voice traffic 
this is a contributing factor to the increases in our revenue in and we expect that this trend of year over year increases in traffic volume will continue as long as the russian economy continues to develop at its current pace 
although our revenue growth is strong  our overall margins continue to be impacted by price increases for services received from monopolistic incumbent operators 
in order to handle additional traffic volumes  we have expanded and will continue to expand our fiber optic capacity along our heavy traffic and high cost routes to mitigate declines in traffic margins  reduce our unit transmission costs and ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for data and internet services 
we expect to continue to add additional transmission capacity  which due to its fixed cost nature can initially depress margins  but will over time allow us to improve or maintain our margins 
we continue to follow our strategy of regional expansion 
the project for the construction of the intercity fiber optic link that we launched in the middle of has continued throughout and into at present  we are constructing in partnership with vimpelcom an inter city fiber optic link from moscow to ufa through nizhny novgorod and kazan 
subject to weather conditions  we expect that this inter city fiber optic link will be operational in the fourth quarter of to date  this inter city fiber optic link has been completed from moscow to nizhny novgorod and from ufa to almetyevsk 
at present we have laid approximately  kilometers of cable for this project  we anticipate that the entire moscow to ufa inter city fiber optic link will require us to lay approximately  kilometers of cable 
we intend to connect our operations in the european part of russia to this backbone network and plan to invest a total of approximately million to million in this and related backbone projects through in addition  we started construction of the oktyabrsky to samara inter city fiber optic link 
at present we have laid approximately kilometers of cable for this project  we anticipate that the entire oktyabrsky to samara inter city fiber optic link will require us to lay approximately kilometers of cable 
this oktyabrsky to samara link is part of a larger fiber optic cable line also being constructed in partnership with vimpelcom that will run from ufa to saratov 
we plan on completing this project by the end of to date  we have invested approximately million in these projects 
the rapid growth of the telecommunications market in russia  ukraine  and the cis is fueled by macroeconomic growth and the inflow of direct foreign investment 
we anticipate that the economic growth in these markets will create additional demand for telecommunications services 
additionally  in line with worldwide trends  we are starting to observe new customer demands for more sophisticated telecommunications and internet services as well as other new technologies 
we are responding to these customer demands by testing and implementing new technologies such as voice over internet protocol voip  wireless local loop and high speed consumer internet 
such new technologies will remove some of the barriers to access that some of our customers currently face 
for example  with wireless local loop  we can connect remote customers to our network by bypassing the incumbents wire network in order to provide higher quality access 
our customers are willing to pay a premium for this type of technology and customer service 
we continue to see growth opportunities organically  through select acquisitions  and through the development of new product lines 
while our research indicates the telecommunications services sector in business segments in the moscow and st 
petersburg markets of fixed telecommunications services will continue to grow  we believe that the bulk of our growth will come from key regional cities 
we will continue to align the strategy of each of our business segments with market forces in the countries where we operate 
in bcs  our strategy is to defend and grow our market share through attractive service offerings supported by excellent customer care 
we are focused on expanding into the regions as well as the fast growing small and medium sized businesses smb and the small office home office soho markets 
in those cases where the potential smb and soho customer is not on our network  our ability to fully benefit from growth in these market segments largely depends on the regulatory situation and our ability to get access to the copper and other infrastructure of the incumbent operators under reasonable terms and conditions 
in carrier and operator services  our strategy focuses on partnering with more operators in the regions to enhance our termination capabilities 
we have also launched additional value added products for our carrier partners that strengthen our leading position in the russian and cis markets 
these new products are designed to offer best quality voice and data transport to ensure greater customer loyalty while protecting margins 
in consumer internet services  we recognize that new technologies are making their way into russia  ukraine  and the cis 
we expect that broadband competition and substitution will increase in the future  and that dial up margins will continue to decline over time as the average revenue per subscriber continues to decline 
in response to a decline in our dial up subscriber base in moscow  we are currently exploring opportunities to enter the broadband market in moscow and elsewhere in russia 
we currently offer consumer broadband in selected cities such as st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod  ekaterinburg  krasnoyarsk  and sochi 
however  our expansion in this area is currently limited by restrictions on our access to unbundled local loop 
therefore  we are currently looking at 
table of contents alternatives to deliver quality broadband internet services at competitive pricing in our major markets 
as part of our broadband access strategy  we recently entered into a framework agreement with nortel to develop up to  wifi access nodes in moscow  with the possibility to increase the number of access nodes as needed 
we plan to offer universal indoor and outdoor access to the majority of approximately million households in moscow 
the services to be offered will include voip capabilities that will be packaged with our aport internet search engine to offer location based search services 
the broadband services will be competitively priced and will offer higher speed services than many other internet access services currently available in moscow 
currently  we expect to continue testing of our wifi access nodes in selected areas and anticipate concluding testing during the second quarter of after the wifi testing is completed  we will phase in our customer access plans throughout moscow 
additionally  as part of this broadband access rollout strategy  we have deployed approximately dsl nodes outside of moscow with a combined capacity of  ports  of which  are already deployed 
we plan to continue such development of broadband and dsl in other selected regions 
additionally  to enhance our overall consumer internet strategy  we have combined both the consumer broadband and dial up internet businesses into one business unit 
our mobile services line of business allows us to provide additional services to our ukrainian wireline customers 
in the future  we expect to follow a marketing strategy aimed on attracting high revenue customers and maintaining our corporate market share in kiev and odessa 
however  in the mass market  whether the current level of competition requires nationwide coverage capabilities and aggressive advertising campaigns to be successful  our market share and revenues will decline 
our recently constructed ftn will also present new opportunities for growth 
our ftn provides us with a potential customer base across all geographic zones in the russian federation of up to million businesses  million people  of which there are million residential customers  in the russian regions 
this is an increase from our previous breadth of coverage which only allowed us to reach regions in russia with a population of million people 
with the ftn  we will be able to offer our wide range of telecommunications services  including dld ild telecommunications services  to every person and all businesses across russia s eleven time zones 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to assist that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition policies  we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers and installed 
under multiple delivery contracts  involving a combination of product delivery  installation and maintenance  connection and service fees  revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the respective amounts 
elements are grouped if they are inseparable or objective evidence of fair value does not exist 
certain revenues  such as connection and installation fees  are deferred 
we also defer direct incremental costs related to connection fees  not exceeding the revenue deferred 
deferred revenues are subsequently recognized over the estimated average customer lives  which are periodically reassessed by us  and such reassessment may impact our future operating results 
in determining the recording of revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in assessing the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the allowance estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the creditworthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
in particular  we have certain amounts due to and from subsidiaries of a european telecommunications operator who is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of this matter will be affected by a number of factors including the determination of legal obligations of each party  the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  and the enforceability of any determinations 
we have recognized provisions based on our preliminary estimate of net exposure on the resolution of these receivables and payables 
if our assessment proves to be incorrect we may have to recognize an additional provision of up to million  net of tax  although management believes that the possibility of such an adverse outcome is remote 
long lived asset recovery policies  this policy is in relation to long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangibles  which comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
changes in technology or changes in our intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we perform periodic internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets  including intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting useful lives and testing for recoverability of our long lived assets require the exercise of management s judgment and estimation based on certain assumptions concerning the expected life of any asset and expected future cash flows from the use of an asset 

table of contents goodwill and assessment of impairment  commencing from the adoption of statement on financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we perform goodwill impairment testing annually as of october or whenever impairment indicators exist 
this test requires a significant degree of judgment about the future events and it includes determination of the reporting units  allocation of goodwill to the reporting units and comparison of the fair value with the carrying amount of each reporting unit 
based on the discounted cash flow valuations performed in  we concluded that for all reporting units the fair value is in excess of the respective carrying amounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset  we record valuation allowances related to tax effects of deductible temporary differences and loss carry forwards when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that the respective tax assets will not be realized 
changes in our assessment of probability of realization of deferred tax assets may impact our effective income tax rate 
business segment information  we report four segments within the telecommunications industry business and corporate services  carrier and operator services  consumer internet services and mobile services 
a significant portion of our cost structure  including our investment in infrastructure  benefits multiple segments 
as a result  we perform allocations of certain costs in order to report business segment information for management and financial reporting purposes 
applying different allocation techniques and parameters could impact the reported results of individual business segments 
functional currency  effective january   russia is no longer considered a hyperinflationary economy  therefore the determination of functional currency for united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap reporting purposes should be based on the analysis of the underlying business transactions for each foreign subsidiary 
we have determined in accordance with the functional currency criteria of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  that the usd should be considered the functional currency of all foreign subsidiaries 
there are subjective elements in this determination  including a weight given to each specific criteria established by sfas no 
changes in the underlying business transactions could lead to different functional currency determination for a particular subsidiary  which would have an impact on its reported financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment 
we believe the following items represent such particularly sensitive accounting estimates allowance for doubtful accounts  any changes in the underlying assumptions of recoverability of accounts receivable by respective aging group or certain specific accounts that are excluded from the specific and general allowances could have a material effect on our current and future results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover estimated losses in our accounts receivable balances under current conditions 
tax provisions  in the course of preparing financial statements in accordance with us gaap  we record potential tax loss provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in general sfas no 
requires loss contingencies to be recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we record other deferred tax provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required to determine when such provisions should be recorded  and when facts and circumstances change  when such provisions should be released 
useful lives of property and equipment and certain intangible assets  our network assets and amortizable intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over periods generally ranging from five to ten years 
any reduction or increase in the estimated useful lives for a particular category of fixed assets or intangible assets could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
business combinations  sfas no 
 business combinations  requires us to recognize the share in the assets of businesses acquired and respective liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
our estimates of the fair value of the identified intangible assets of businesses acquired are based on our expectations of future results of operations of such businesses 
recent accounting pronouncements until january   we followed the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for our equity participation plan and sars plans 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments 
the fair value method requires compensation cost to be measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and to be recognized over the service period 
sfas no 
generally allowed companies to either account for stock based compensation under the fair value method of sfas no 
or under the intrinsic value method of apb accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we had elected to account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
and present pro forma disclosures of results of operations as if the fair value method had been adopted 
the intrinsic value of the sars  which are classified as liability awards  and the related compensation expense are re measured at the end of each reporting period 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
under sfas no 
r  companies must calculate and record the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received in the income statement  pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted with certain exceptions and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r until january  for calendar year companies 
sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this sfas no 
r as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date and a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to reflect compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma amounts disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as we currently accounts for stock options issued to employees in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized 
we currently account for sars by remeasuring the intrinsic value of the sars at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense and the related liability for the change in 
table of contents intrinsic value 
as of january   we will account for sars at fair value  in compliance with sfas no 
r 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as the incremental compensation expense will depend  among other factors  on the amount of share based awards granted in future periods

revenue from the bcs division of gtu increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase in revenue was due to a increase in the number of serviced voice lines partially resulting from growth in residential customers and a increase in the average rate per minute of use resulting from a change in traffic mix in favor of higher rated traffic to mobile networks 
additionally  data and internet revenue increased by approximately million due to an increase in the number of ports in service

revenue for the carrier and operator services division of gtu decreased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  million of this decrease was the result of a decrease in incoming international revenue

as mentioned previously  umc received an international carrier license in the third quarter of  allowing it to operate independently on the international markets without using the gtu network for transit purposes 
the decrease in incoming international revenue was offset by a million increase in carrier s carrier revenue due to a increase in carrier s carrier minutes of use resulting from a rise in low margin transit traffic on mobile networks

offsetting the decrease in dial up revenue was a million increase in other consumer internet products  such as consumer broadband  primarily from customers outside of moscow 
we anticipate that our revenue from consumer broadband will increase as we embark with our broadband access rollout 
our current and past base of dial up internet subscribers in moscow and throughout russia will allow us to specifically target subscribers that currently use or have previously used our internet services 
mobile services 
revenue from mobile services decreased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  active subscribers decreased from  at december   to  at december   due to increased competition in the ukrainian mobile market

intangible assets our intangible assets increased at december  as compared to december  as a result of our acquisition of st holding in february  our acquisition of balticom mobile in april  buzton in may and the build out of new numbering capacity 

table of contents minority interest our minority interest increased at december  as compared to december  as a result of minority interests in the equity of gtu  zao samara telecom  zao westbalt telecom and buzton 
except for gtu  each of these consolidated subsidiaries was acquired during the first half of minority interests in the earnings of gtu arose in due to the sale of a non controlling interest to our local partners in ukraine 
stockholders equity shareholders equity increased from december  to december  as a result of our net income of million  cash proceeds of approximately million received from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by declaring and paying million dividends for the year ended december  in addition  we transferred of the ownership interest in gtu to a ukrainian partner in exchange for services provided by the partner in august the excess of the fair value of consideration exchanged for services over the book value of of net assets of gtu was recorded as a credit to the consolidated equity 
in the third quarter of  management determined that we have been inadvertently carrying accruals for estimated taxes  other than income taxes 
management concluded these accruals for estimated taxes should have been considered unnecessary and reversed prior to january  the net effect of the correction of this non cash error was to reduce current liabilities and non current liabilities by million each with an offsetting decrease to accumulated deficit of million in all periods presented 
income taxes our effective rate of income tax differs from the us statutory rate due to the impact of the following factors different income tax rates and regulations apply in the countries where we operate  expenses non deductible on the income tax return  write offs of certain assets are not deductible for tax purposes  and changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we currently have deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences in our non us subsidiaries 
due to the continued profitability of these subsidiaries  we anticipate that these deferred tax assets will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
we also have deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences for us federal income tax purposes 
in  we recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets due to our reassessment of sources of future taxable income in the united states 
we have also recorded a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carry forwards for cyprus tax purposes 
however  we have recorded a full valuation allowance since we do not anticipate recognizing taxable income in our cyprus entity in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
our total restricted cash was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
the restricted cash is maintained in connection with certain of our debt obligations as described below 
during the year ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities 
during the year ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities 
this increase in net cash inflows from operating activities at december   is mainly due to the increase of net income as a result of increased revenues 
during the year ended december   we received approximately million in cash from our customers for services and we paid approximately million to suppliers and employees 
during the year ended december   we received approximately million in cash from our customers for services and we paid approximately million to suppliers and employees 
we used cash of million and million for investing activities for the year ended december   and  respectively  which were principally attributable to building our telecommunications networks and acquisitions 
network investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   and included capital expenditures principally attributable to building out our telecommunications network 
the majority of network investing activities related to construction of last mile access  the construction of our ftn  and the intercity fiber project and network upgrades as a result of increased customer connections 
network investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  with respect to capital expenditures in  we expect that these expenditures will increase by approximately  in terms of a percentage of revenues  up from of revenues in  to approximately of revenues in the capital expenditures increase is largely attributable to the implementation of our broadband strategy  the construction of the ftn  and the build out of the fiber optic network 

table of contents minority interest we used cash of million for the year ended december   for acquisitions which include dicom  sakhalin telecom  sochitelecom  and rascom 
we used cash of million for the year ended december   for acquisitions which include st holding  buzton  uralrelcom  and balticom mobile 
for the year ended december   we received million net proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and for the year ended december   we received million net proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  we also received a million cash contribution from our minority partner in ukraine 
in  we paid quarterly dividends of per common share to shareholders totaling million 
in february our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share to shareholders of record as of march  the total amount of payable of approximately million will be paid to shareholders on march  we had working capital of million as of december   and million as of december  at december   we had a negligible amount of long term debt  excluding capital lease obligations 
at december   we had total debt  excluding capital lease obligations  of approximately million  none of which were current maturities 
total debt included amounts that were fully collateralized by restricted cash 
as part of our drive to increase our network capacity  reduce costs and improve the quality of our service  we have leased additional fiber optic and satellite based network capacity  the terms of these leases are generally five years or more and can involve significant advance payments 
as demand for our telecommunication services increases we expect to enter into additional capacity agreements and may make significant financial commitments  in addition to our existing commitments 
in the year ended december   we entered into approximately million of satellite transponder capacity agreements generally with terms of years 
in august  we entered into a lease for fiber optic capacity  including facilities and maintenance  on major routes within ukraine 
the lease has a term of five years and total payments of million 
the first year of the lease has been prepaid while payments should be made on a monthly basis in subsequent years 
in order to comply with the known long distance license requirements and to be operational in  we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures and approximately million in operational expenditures in in total  we estimate that we will need to make capital expenditures of approximately million in order to fulfill the network requirements  specified in the interconnection rules and to successfully implement our long distance license 
however  there are still unknown and yet to be clarified portions of the laws and regulations that will affect both the timing and cost of the long distance license implementation 
some of our operating companies have received debt financing through direct loans from affiliated companies 
in addition  certain operating companies have borrowed funds under a back to back  seven year credit facility for up to million from a russian subsidiary of citibank 
under this facility  we provide full cash collateral  held in london  and recorded on our balance sheet as restricted cash  for onshore loans made by the bank to our russian registered joint ventures 
in a second  similar facility  we provide full cash collateral for a short term back to back  revolving  credit facility for up to million from the same bank for two of our larger russian operating companies 
the funding level as of december   for all these facilities totaled million was funded to our non consolidated entities 
in the future  we may execute large or numerous acquisitions  which may require external financing most likely to be raised through secured or unsecured borrowings 
however  we may also raise the required funding through a dilutive equity issuance  through the divestment of non core assets  or combinations of the above 
in case large or numerous acquisitions do not materialize  we expect our current sources of funding to finance our capital requirements 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates because of changes or fluctuations in our anticipated acquisitions  investments  revenue  operating costs  technology and network expansion plans and access to alternative sources of financing on favorable terms 
further  in order for us to compete successfully  we may require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations 
we will also require capital for other acquisition and business development initiatives 
we expect to fund these requirements through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings  and debt financing facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
as a result  we may become subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants  our interest obligations may increase significantly and our shareholders may be adversely diluted 
our failure to generate sufficient funds in the future  whether from operations or by raising additional debt or equity capital  may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our anticipated expenditures  to sell assets  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in late and subsequent years  we may incur significant cash outlays to settle sars issued in to our ceo  senior management  and other employees 
these cash outlays could be especially significant if our stock price exceeds per share prior to certain deadlines specified in the sar plans occurring in the second half of the terms of these sars are described in

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our treasury function has managed our funding  liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our investment treasury operations are conducted within guidelines that have been established and authorized by our audit committee 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any treasury management transactions of a speculative nature 
the ruble and the hryvna are generally non convertible outside russia and ukraine  respectively  so our ability to hedge against devaluation by converting to other currencies is significantly limited 
further  our ability to convert rubles and hryvna into other currencies in russia and ukraine  respectively  is subject to rules that restrict the purposes for which conversion and the payment of foreign currencies are allowed 
given that much of our operating costs are indexed to or denominated in usd  including employee compensation expense  capital expenditure and interest expense  we have taken specific steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the appropriate foreign currency 
although local currency control regulations require us to collect virtually all of our revenue in local currency  our subsidiaries generally either price or invoice in usd or index their invoices and collections to the applicable usd exchange rate 
customer contracts may include clauses allowing additional invoicing if the applicable exchange rate changes significantly between the invoice date and the date of payment  favorable terms for early or pre payments and heavy penalty clauses for overdue payments 
maintaining the usd value of our revenue subjects us to additional tax on exchange gains 
although we are attempting to match revenue  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our cash and cash equivalents are held largely in interest bearing accounts  in usd  however we do have bank accounts denominated in russian rubles and ukrainian hryvna 
the book values of such accounts at december  and approximate their fair value 
cash in excess of our immediate operating needs is invested in us money market instruments 
in accordance with our investment policy  we maintain a diversified portfolio of low risk  fully liquid securities 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our obligations and we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign currency exchange rate risk and we also periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign currency exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure
