in  we divested the businesses comprising our direct marketing and retail business segments 
more specifically  in june we sold our dan s competition business  or dcr  and in december  we completed a spinoff of delia s  inc to our shareholders which included the delia s  ccs and alloy merchandise businesses 
accordingly  the results of operations of our direct marketing and retail business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented

executive summary alloy is a non traditional media and marketing services company that primarily targets the youth demographic segment comprising persons in the united states between the ages of and we operate our business through three operating segments promotion  media and placement 
our promotion segment is comprised of businesses whose products are promotional in nature and includes our alloy marketing and promotion business  our on campus marketing unit  as well as our mall marketing and sampling divisions 
our media segment is comprised of company owned entertainment media assets including our out of home  internet  database  specialty print  and entertainment businesses 
our placement segment is made up of our businesses that aggregate and market third party media properties owned by others primarily in the college  military and multicultural markets 
these three operating segments utilize a wide array of our online and offline media and marketing assets  such as websites  magazines  college and high school newspapers  on campus message boards  and college guides  giving us significant reach into our target demographic audience and providing our advertising clients with significant exposure to the youth market 
a variety of factors influence our revenue  including but not limited to i economic conditions and the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy  ii advertiser and consumer spending patterns  iii the value of our consumer brands and database  iv the continued perception by our advertisers and sponsors that we offer effective marketing solutions  v use of our websites  and vi competitive and alternative advertising mediums 
in addition  our business is seasonal  with approximately of our revenue being realized in our third fiscal quarter back to school time and approximately in the last half of the fiscal year 
quarterly comparisons are also affected by these factors 
we intend to continue to expand our media segment through acquisition and internal generated growth  as this segment provides the greatest opportunity to increase profitability and shareholder value 
in this regard  we completed the acquisition of sconex  inc in march sconex offers a social networking website for high school students 
while sconex is a relatively young company  we believe that it will continue to gain new users through word of mouth  virally  and as a result of the support our media properties can provide 
we also plan to continue to try to maximize profitability  not necessarily growth  in our promotion and placement segments 
in addition  we also believe our business should continue to grow as we capitalize on the following key assets broad access 
we are able to reach a significant portion of targeted consumers by i producing college guides  books and recruitment publications  ii owning and operating over  display media boards 
table of contents on college and high school campuses throughout the united states  iii placing advertising in over  college and high school newspapers  and iv maintaining and expanding our ability to execute large scale promotional service programs 
comprehensive youth database 
as of january   our database contained information on approximately million individuals 
in addition to names and addresses  our database contains a variety of valuable information that may include age  postal address  stated interests  on line behavior  educational level and socioeconomic factors 
we continually refresh and grow our database with information we gather through our media properties and marketing services  as well as through acquisitions of companies that have database information 
we analyze this data in detail  which we believe enables us to not only improve response rates from our own direct marketing sales efforts but also to offer advertisers cost effective ways of reaching highly targeted audiences 
established marketing franchises 
our principal marketing franchises are well known by consumers and by advertisers that target this market 
for advertisers  alloy media marketing  the umbrella name for all of our media and marketing brands  as well as many of our company owned brands have a history in creating and implementing advertising and marketing programs targeting the youth market 
strong relationship with advertisers and marketing partners 
we strive to provide advertisers and our marketing partners with highly targeted  measurable and effective means to reach their target market 
our seasoned advertising sales force has established strong relationships with youth marketers 
results of operations and financial condition the principal components of our operating expenses are placement  production and distribution costs including ad placement fees  catalog and signage fees  temporary help and production costs  selling expenses including personnel costs  commissions  promotions and bad debt expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and special charges 
our promotion and placement segments have significant variable costs  while the media segment s costs are largely fixed in nature 
as a result  an increase or decrease in revenue attributable to the promotion and placement segments typically results in segment operating income increasing or decreasing by a similar percentage 
however  because the media segment has relatively low variable costs  in a period of rising revenue  operating income in the media segment grows faster than the growth of revenue  and conversely  in a period of declining revenue  operating income falls faster than the decline in revenue 
revenue revenues for each business segment for the fiscal years ended january   and were as follows fiscal years ended january  amount of total amount of total amount of total promotion media placement total revenue revenue for fiscal increased  or  compared with the fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
the increase was attributable to strength in our promotion and media segments  in which revenue increased by  and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in placement segment revenue 
in fiscal  we were more selective in the type of business promotion we accepted by rejecting business that did not meet minimum profit expectations 

table of contents promotion segment revenue in fiscal increased compared with fiscal the increase was attributable to increases in mall marketing approximately  and an increase in on campus sampling and product offerings approximately  partially offset by the loss of programs for certain clients due to territory shifts approximately  as well as a more selective business acceptance process as we implement minimum customer profitability requirements 
in fiscal  media segment revenue increased compared with fiscal the increase was principally attributable to an approximate  increase in our out of home business and  an approximate  increase in revenue attributable to college guides and databases  partially offset by an approximate  decrease in print ads 
placement segment revenue decreased nominally in fiscal from fiscal revenue for fiscal decreased  or less than  compared with fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to weakness in our promotion and placement segments  in which revenue declined by  and  respectively  partially offset by a  increase in media segment revenue 
promotion segment revenue in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to a net decrease in promotion program spending by clients approximately  partially offset by new sponsorship revenue attributable to events approximately media segment revenue in fiscal increased compared with fiscal the increase was principally attributable to our acquisition of insite advertising  which contributed approximately  to the segment s growth 
placement revenue in fiscal decreased from fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to several clients decreasing their print advertising spending 
we expect our revenue in the fiscal year ending january  fiscal to increase compared with fiscal  resulting primarily from the expansion of our media segment and improvements to our product and service offerings 
expenses operating costs operating costs for the years ended january    and were as follows fiscal years ended january  amount of total amount of total amount of total placement  production and distribution selling expenses other operating costs operating costs increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and increased  or  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in operating costs in fiscal was principally attributable to i an increase in selling expenses attributable to higher incentive compensation  and ii higher occupancy costs  advertising  and shipping expenses  partially offset by the effects of a fiscal cost reduction program 

table of contents the increase in operating costs in fiscal was principally attributable to a  increase in placement  production and distribution costs resulting from higher usage of temporary employees  partially due to the acquisition of insite advertising  and printing  distribution  inventory and signage costs  as a result of the may acquisition of our on campus marketing division their results were only included in fiscal for just over months as compared with months in fiscal  partially offset by a reduction in ad placement fees  and lower catalog costs 
we currently anticipate that operating costs will increase in fiscal compared with fiscal due to additional investments in our media assets  normal recurring contractual cost increases  personnel increases  variable costs attributable to increasing our promotion and placement segments revenue  and as a result of charges associated with adopting sfas no

the fiscal increase was principally attributable to higher accounting fees  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance matters  general and workers compensation insurance  rent  legal expenses  and non cash restricted stock compensation 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher personnel compensation and insurance costs as a result of adopting sfas no

the non cash impairment charges resulted from performing annual impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
and prior to the spinoff of delia s  inc in fiscal  our operations were only included in one segment sponsorship 
despite the current year improvement in our business  as a result of redefining our previous sponsorship segment into our three current segments after the spinoff of delia s  inc  we were required to record an additional impairment charge at the end of fiscal

in fiscal  our interest income increased from interest income earned in fiscal due to higher cash balances and interest rates 
the increase in fiscal was attributable to the issuance of our convertible debentures in july and august of other items  net other items are principally comprised of expenses attributable to write offs of minority investments and net realized gains and losses on the sales of marketable securities 
in fiscal  we wrote off a minority investment in a private company that was having difficulty funding its operations and in fiscal  we wrote off of minority investments in private companies that either declared bankruptcy or ceased operations 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
due to our history of incurring operating losses  we have established a valuation allowance on all our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the tax provisions for fiscal and were due to state income taxes 
our fiscal income tax expense of  was due to our decision to establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was established as a result of increased uncertainty over the realization of deferred tax assets  in part as a result of our acquisition of delia s corp 
weighted average shares as a result of incurring a net loss from continuing operations for all periods presented  basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are equivalent  as common stock equivalents from the conversion of our convertible debentures and from stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
weighted average shares outstanding increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and increased  or  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was principally attributable to the conversion to common stock of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock in june the increase in fiscal was principally attributable to the issuance of common stock in conjunction with acquisitions of companies

funding requirements are financed primarily through the sale of equity  equity linked and debt securities or through our operations 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents of  and  of long term marketable securities 
we believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to fund ongoing operating requirements 
however  if our current sources of liquidity and cash generated from our operations are insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional capital 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when we need it or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services 
in addition  we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  as compared with net cash used in operating activities of  for fiscal excluding the effect of cash provided by or used in discontinued operations in both periods  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  compared with a use of cash from operating activities of  in fiscal  an improvement of  the improvement in cash provided by operating activities excluding discontinued operations was primarily attributable to a reduction in the net loss from continuing operations  partially offset by reductions in non cash charges in fiscal compared with fiscal cash provided by investing activities excluding net cash provided by or used in investing activities by discontinued operations was approximately  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal capital expenditures decreased  or  to in fiscal compared with  in fiscal excluding our cash needs to complete acquisitions of companies  we do not spend significant amounts of cash on fixed assets 
while we spent approximately on fixed assets in fiscal  we expect our ongoing capital expenditures  exclusive of expenditures attributable to acquisitions  to be in the range of   on an annual basis 
net cash provided by financing activities excluding discontinued operations was in fiscal compared with a use of in fiscal our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to  of our common stock and  of our convertible debentures 
as of january   our unused repurchase authorization for our common stock was approximately  as of january   we have not repurchased any of our convertible debentures 

table of contents as more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  at january   we had  of convertible debentures outstanding 
as a result of our spinoff of delia s  inc  each  principal amount of our convertible debentures is now convertible into shares of our common stock and shares of delia s  inc common stock 
therefore  if the entire issuance converted  we would be required to issue an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock and delia s  inc would be required to issue an aggregate of approximately  shares of its common stock 
we are responsible for paying interest on the entire face amount of the convertible debentures  and if not converted to common stock  are responsible entirely for the repayment of the convertible debentures 
accordingly  we are currently evaluating ways of reducing the outstanding debt and future interest payments  including possible early retirement of the convertible debentures 
contractual obligations the following table presents our significant contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations senior convertible debentures due a operating lease obligations b capital lease obligations including interest c purchase obligations d future non compete payments total a the senior convertible debentures due may be redeemed after august  at the option of the company or on august   and at the option of the holders

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses  among other things  our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets  inventory obsolescence  income tax valuation allowances and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer credit issues and bankruptcies 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable portfolio and a customer by customer analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical write offs on receivables  specific customer situations  and the economic environments in which we operate 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and is dependent upon the overall economic environment and our customer viability 
these estimates affect the balance of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets and operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimated useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the useful lives  which are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements  are estimated at the time the asset is acquired and are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
alternately  these types of technological changes could result in the recognition of an impairment charge to reflect the write down in value of the asset 
we review these types of assets for impairment annually  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
beginning february   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill but review it at least annually for impairment 
see the discussion of special charges above for a description of impairment charges recorded by the company in fiscal   and impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is designed to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit generally  our reportable segments with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant 
table of contents impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units which also may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the economic environment in which we operate 
these estimates affect the balance of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets and on our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted in  long lived assets  such as fixed assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
valuation of stock options and warrants for purposes of computing the value of stock options and warrants  various valuation methods and assumptions can be used 
the selection of a different valuation method or use of different assumptions may result in a value that is significantly different from that computed by the company 
in certain circumstances  usually depending on the complexity of the calculation  we may employ the services of a valuation expert
