item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item a 
overview decode is a biopharmaceutical company applying its discoveries in human genetics to develop drugs for common diseases 
our population approach and resources enable us to isolate genes and drug targets directly involved in the development of many of the biggest challenges to public health 
we are turning these discoveries into a growing pipeline of therapeutics aimed at combating the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
as these diseases are common and current therapies are of limited effectiveness  we believe that our strategy represents a significant opportunity to create better medicine with major potential in the global marketplace 
we believe that decode s advantage derives from our population approach to human genetics and the ability to apply this approach across the drug development process 
in iceland  we have comprehensive population resources that enable our scientists to efficiently conduct genome and population wide scans to identify key genes and gene variations contributing to common diseases 
the proteins encoded by these genes  and other proteins with which they interact in the disease pathway  offer drug targets that we believe are directly involved in the onset and progression of disease 
small molecule drugs that target these proteins may therefore represent a direct means of modulating the onset or progression of the disease 
through our medicinal chemistry and structural biology subsidiaries based in the united states  we are able to discover novel small molecule therapeutic compounds  take candidate compounds through pre clinical testing  and manufacture sufficient quantities for early stage clinical trials 
our product development group designs and implements our clinical development programs 
by leveraging the capabilities of encode  and our expertise in genetics and drug and disease modeling  we are able to make the drug development process a more efficient and sensitive means of testing and optimizing the therapeutic and commercial potential of new drugs 
in certain programs we have also taken advantage of the fact that drug targets we have identified through our genetics research have already been targeted by other companies to develop compounds for other indications 
by licensing these compounds or entering into co development arrangements  we have been able to bypass over several years of drug discovery  entering directly into phase ii clinical trials 
our goal is to bring to market new drugs for major indications  and in so doing make the company profitable and create value for our shareholders 
to achieve this goal we must ensure that we have the capabilities and financial means to expand and advance our pipeline through the long  risky and expensive process of drug development and on to the market 
this requires us to constantly evaluate the optimal balance between several factors  including the level of our investment in research and development  the preservation of cash resources and their deployment for product development  and the financing environment 
in order to support our drug development infrastructure  to focus the use of our cash resources on our proprietary therapeutics programs  and to diversify risk in our overall drug development portfolio  we leverage our capabilities to form corporate alliances and to provide services to fee paying customers 
we also receive contract and grant funding from various governmental agencies 
we have formed drug and other product development alliances with roche and merck  among others 
in addition to conducting work on our targets in our collaborative and internal programs  our medicinal chemistry subsidiary provides drug discovery services and contract manufacturing of therapeutic compounds for human clinical trials for our fee for service customers 
our other service offerings include protein crystallography products and instruments  as well as protein structure analysis contract services through our structural biology subsidiary  clinical trials services through encode  and dna analysis services through our genotyping laboratory in reykjavik 
we derive revenues primarily from research funding and other fees from our service customers and collaborative partners  milestone payments and upfront  exclusivity  technology access and technology development fees under our collaboration agreements constitute most of the rest of our revenues 
while we are entitled to royalties or profit sharing under the terms of some of our agreements  due to the extended time period for the development and commercialization of a saleable product or therapy  we have not yet received royalties or profit sharing under any of our contracts and do not expect to do so for several years  if at all 
our expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses such as  salaries and related employee costs  materials and supplies  and contractor services 
we believe that ongoing work in genetics and advancing our drug development programs  particularly the conduct of clinical trials on a growing number of our compounds  will require significant and increasing expenditures 
in  we concluded the phase ii clinical studies for dg  our developmental compound for the prevention of heart attack  initiated our phase i clinical program for dg  our developmental compound for peripheral artery disease pad  and initiated a phase ii trial in asthma 
in the first half of  we expect to finalize our protocol and begin enrollment for a phase iii trial for dg  we have concluded our phase i program for dgand expect to begin phase ii  and we expect to conclude our phase ii trial in asthma 
we are also advancing our pre clinical work on our follow on compound in heart attack  dg  and on dg for pain  and expect these to be the next programs we bring into clinical development 
we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next several years  due to  in addition to the above mentioned factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and as we advance and broaden our drug development pipeline we will require significant additional capital for product development and so we will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing 
our ability to obtain capital will be affected by conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry 
we expect that downturns in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally will restrict our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms  while more favorable conditions in those markets will present opportunities for us 
the difficulties facing the pharmaceutical industry present for us both near term challenges and significant longer term opportunities 
one of the main issues confronting big pharmaceutical companies is their lack of promising new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
in the short term  the financial pressures on pharmaceutical companies may be reflected in their research and development spending  making it more difficult for us to sign corporate alliances with significant up front funding  or lengthening the time required to negotiate such deals 
we believe that in the medium to longer term  however  companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs  either alone or as partners of pharmaceutical companies 
our partnerships demonstrate that the industry is already investing in the development of new therapeutics based on our approach 
research and development programs the following is a summary of the development of our drug candidates in late pre clinical or clinical development 
because of uncertainties involved in the drug development process  the actual timing for the events described below may differ materially from that provided in this summary 
our most advanced developmental compound is dg for the prevention of heart attack 
in  we concluded the phase ii clinical trials for dg we have submitted the safety summary and results of the phase ii trials to the fda and have conducted an end of phase ii meeting with the fda 
we are working with the fda under a special protocol assessment to finalize the protocol for a phase iii outcome trial for dg which will focus on african americans with the hapk variant in the ltah gene 
the initiation of the dg phase iii trial may be affected by timelines for manufacturing  packaging  labeling and shipping of clinical supplies  negotiating with cros for clinical trial performance  and the approval process for the study protocol by local institutional review boards irb and or the fda 
we expect to begin enrolling patients for the phase iii trial in the first half of dg is our lead compound for the treatment of atherosclerosis of the extremities  or peripheral artery disease pad 
dg is a first in class small molecule inhibitor of the ep receptor for prostaglandin e  a g protein coupled receptor gpcr encoded by a gene we have shown to be associated with increased risk of developing the disease 
our ind application for dg was accepted by the fda in february and on this basis we began the phase i program for this compound 
in fall  our chemistry group developed a new formulation which increased bioavailability by nearly four fold  and we concluded the phase i program in early nearly healthy subjects were exposed to dg in these studies at doses up to mg day for seven days 
the results of the phase i program showed dg to be well tolerated  without any drug related significant adverse events noted  and that dg can effectively inhibit platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner without increasing bleeding time 
we expect to begin a phase ii clinical trial in the first half of in asthma  we are conducting a phase ii trial on behalf of another company 
this compound inhibits mapk  a kinase encoded by a gene we have linked to risk of asthma 
we expect to conclude this study in the second quarter of as a follow on to dg  we are developing an inhibitor of ltah  a compound which is likewise aimed at preventing heart attack by decreasing the production of ltb our pre clinical compound  dg  appears to provide potent inhibition of ltb production  is orally bioavailable  and with minimal potential for drug drug interaction 
we anticipate filing an ind on dg in utilizing compounds discovered in our program on peripheral artery disease  our drug discovery group is bringing forward a lead pre clinical candidate  dg  for the treatment of pain 
pre clinical studies of dg demonstrate that it is efficacious in a mouse model for pain 
moreover  by targeting the ep receptor for prostaglandins e  it may be possible to avert the risk of cardiovascular events and gastric ulceration that accompany the long term use of selective cox inhibitors and other nsaids 
decode expects to file an ind on dg in we are pursuing a pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche and working on identifying and advancing a lead pre clinical compound 
we use many of our employee and infrastructure resources across several programs  and many of our research and development costs are indirectly attributable to an individually named program or are directed broadly to applicable research programs 
however  taking into account costs that are specifically attributable to individual programs and allocations of our research and development program costs based upon those direct costs  we have cumulatively invested million  million and million and million in our myocardial infarction mi  pad  stroke and asthma programs  respectively  from the beginning of to date 
inception to date costs are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program 
we have not applied for or received marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in any country for any of our drug candidates 
in order for us to achieve marketing approval in the united states  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidate 
other countries have similar requirements 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials through phase ii have often not been predictive of success in later clinical trials 
many new compounds have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary marketing approvals 
additional risks and uncertainties involved in the development and commercialization of any products are described above under the caption risk factors 
we expect that it will be several years  if ever  before we receive revenues from the commercial sale of our therapeutic products 
furthermore  our strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products 
entering into a collaboration with a partner at any point in the development or commercialization of a product is a business decision 
when making this decision we do and will consider  among other matters  the complexity of the indication  the size  complexity and expense of necessary development and or commercialization efforts  competition in the market and size of the applicable market  an assessment of our own resources financial and operational  and an assessment of the resources of a potential partner 
in the event that we do collaborate on any of the above programs in the future  a partner will have a level of control  which may be significant  over the pre clinical development or clinical trial process for a product 
as a result the completion date of such a partnered program could largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary drug candidate will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
acquisitions and in licensing as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources  or with capabilities that will help accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of urdur verdandi skuld ehf 
uvs  a privately held cancer research firm  from iceland genomics corporation  inc igc  both companies having their principal offices in reykjavik  iceland 
as consideration for the purchase  we issued  shares of decode common stock valued at  to igc 
this acquisition will allow us to broaden our cancer program by applying our gene discovery and drug development efforts to a larger population 
in certain programs we have taken advantage of the fact that drug targets we have identified through our genetics research have already been employed by other companies to make developmental compounds for other indications 
by licensing these compounds or entering into co development arrangements we have been able to leapfrog over several years of drug discovery  entering directly into phase ii clinical trials 
we are currently preparing a phase iii clinical trial for dg  our lead developmental compound for the prevention of heart attack  which we licensed from bayer healthcare ag 
we are also conducting a phase ii trial in asthma on behalf of a third party 
we continue to investigate additional such possibilities for the in licensing or co development of promising existing compounds that may effectively act against targets we have identified through our gene discovery work 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  materials and supplies  derivative financial instruments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates referred to above 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
collaborations and revenue our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
our accounting recognition policies with respect to each significant element of our revenue is summarized as follows research funding and other service fees 
research funding is recognized as earned  typically ratably over the period of effort 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
other service revenues from negotiated rate contracts are recognized based upon the terms of the underlying contract generally either i on a per diem basis as services are rendered  ii on the basis of efforts expended  generally upon the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs of providing the service  or iii upon completion of the service rendered 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by decode 
milestone payments 
in arrangements with multiple elements entered into before june  where i the milestone event is substantive  ii there is substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone  iii the milestone payment amount is commensurate with the magnitude of the related achievement  and iv the associated follow on revenue streams bear a reasonable relationship to one another  we recognize revenue using the substantive milestone method 
under the substantive milestone method  decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we recognize revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator 
milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
in arrangements with multiple elements entered into after june   if the milestone is substantive in nature and there is uncertainty in the achievement of the milestone and there is no further obligation on our part  we record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we recognize revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator milestone payment method 
if the milestone is earned and we have no further obligation under the contract for performance  then we will record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we retroactively recognize revenue through the current period based on the total contractual term and amortize the balance over the remaining contractual term 
up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees 
we recognize revenue from non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the expected customer relationship period or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from such non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known  future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
revenue estimates are reviewed and revised throughout the lives of our contracts and are made based upon current facts and circumstances 
if changes in these estimates or other material adjustments to revenue are identified  the adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions will be recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles we periodically review property and equipment  goodwill and intangibles for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
there were no events in  and that triggered an impairment review nor did our annual review indicate any recoverability issues 
should we determine that there has been an impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets in the future we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
in light of experience and the current technological environment  in we changed certain of our salvage value and useful life estimates for equipment and furniture and fixtures for purposes of depreciation 
these changes in estimates had the effect of increasing depreciation expense in by million as compared to should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the service lives or other estimates inherent in determining the carrying values of our long lived assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
materials and supplies we value our materials and supplies at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining necessary provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete materials and supplies based on historical experience and anticipated usage  giving effect to general market conditions 
any rapid technological changes or future business developments could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete materials and supplies on hand 
furthermore  if our estimates of our needs for materials and supplies prove to be inaccurate  additional provision may be required for incremental excess and obsolete items 
we recorded charges for write down of obsolete and excess materials and supplies of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  and  we used materials and supplies for which we had made provisions for in prior years as slow moving  excess and obsolete  benefiting otherwise reported operating expenses by million  million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange transactions our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  in light of the significance of our operations outside the united states  an important element of our cost base is or will be denominated in icelandic krona  including much of our payroll and other operating expenses and some of our long term borrowings 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations  our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have entered into  and will likely continue to enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to losses of million for the year ended december  although the significant weakening of the us dollar vis vis the icelandic krona during and somewhat abated during  currency fluctuations may continue to adversely affect our financial results 
income taxes significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  including interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  future research and development spending and future levels of capital expenditures 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets resulting from deductible operating losses and other items 
due primarily to our history of operating losses and the expectation that such losses will continue into the foreseeable future  we have concluded that  insufficient positive evidence exists to justify the recognition of our net deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
although there can be no assurance that losses generated to date will be used to offset future taxable income  an adjustment to the valuation of our current net deferred tax assets in the future would increase income in the period that we made a determination that such an adjustment was appropriate 
income tax in iceland is payable in icelandic krona 
consequently  the us dollar value of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
such fluctuations over time may increase or reduce the reported us dollar balance of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and there would be a corresponding gain or loss reported in our income statement 
litigation and other contingencies we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
in doing so  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to legal and other matters as well as potential of probable losses 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective december  the adoption of fin had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error correction sfas no 
 a replacement of apb opinion no 
and statement no 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principles 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the pace and progress of our proprietary research and clinical development efforts  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  and the progress of our own research and development efforts 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct pre clinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
financial highlights as of and for the year ended december  include at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments compared to million including restricted cash at december  the net utilization of million in reflects costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million cash used in operations  together with the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our sturlugata and krokhals facilities in reykjavik  iceland million and also the refinancing of the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility 
research and development expense for proprietary programs was million in as compared to million in and million in the increase in our research and development expenses for proprietary programs is the result principally of costs associated with the advancement of our lead drug development programs in clinical trials 
in march  we entered into a financing for the sale and leaseback of our headquarters facility at sturlugata  reykjavik  iceland 
the sale price for the property was billion icelandic kronas million after taking into account a forward foreign exchange contract we entered into in connection with the sale of the property 
as a result of the sale  we have removed the remaining net book value of the property million from our balance sheet  deferred the resulting gain and have begun recognizing the gain to earnings over the year term of the leaseback 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of sturlugata went to prepay approximately million of short and long term debt that was secured by mortgages on the property and  in this connection  we have recorded a loss on early extinguishment debt amounting to million 
we have leased the property back under a year non cancelable lease agreement at a rent of million icelandic kronas approximately million as of december  per month  subject to changes based on the icelandic consumer price index 
we are accounting for the leaseback as an operating lease 
in june  we entered into a financing for the sale and leaseback of our facility at krokhals d and e  reykjavik  iceland 
the sale price for the property was million icelandic kronas approximately million after taking into account a sales commission 
as a result of the sale  the remaining net book value of the property million has been removed from the balance sheet  and we have begun recognizing the deferred gain to earnings over the year term of the leaseback 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of krokhals were used to prepay approximately million of long term debt that was secured by a mortgage on the property 
decode has leased the krokhals d and e property back under a year non cancelable lease agreement at a rent of million icelandic krona approximately million as of december  per month  subject to changes based on the icelandic consumer price index 
our revenue in was million as compared to million in and million in revenue for the periods presented generally reflects our strategic focus on drug discovery and development 
specifically  the increase in revenue in as compared to is mainly due to grant monies earned  service contract fees and the addition of the roche alliance to co develop inhibitors of pde  offset by the completion of research funding under the agreement with roche and the merck obesity research program 
revenue our business strategy is focused on turning our discoveries into new drugs for the treatment of common diseases 
at the same time  we leverage our capabilities to generate revenue through corporate alliances and through service contracts 
in the majority of our programs we are pursuing drug development on our own 
in certain others  we have formed alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms through which we can cover some of the cost of conducting basic research and spread the risk and investment involved in product development 
we have entered into research  development  commercialization  and fee for service alliances and contracts across our business 
depending on the nature of each prospective business opportunity  the key components of the commercial terms of such arrangements typically include one or more of the following research funding  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees  fees for particular services  milestone payments  license or commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products 
significant elements of our revenue is summarized as follows for the year ended december  in thousands research funding and service fees milestone payments up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees grant funding other collaborations with our most significant partners include f 
hoffmann la roche roche therapeutics 
in  we entered into an agreement with roche to collaborate on four diseases that had been the subject of an earlier collaboration with roche 
during and through january  we collaborated with roche on two of those diseases 
under this agreement we discovered genes linked to diabetes and roche continues drug discovery based on one of these discoveries 
under the agreement  which expired on february   we received million in research funding and we are entitled to receive royalties on the sales of any drugs that are developed coming out of work conducted under this agreement 
in november  we signed a new three year agreement with roche to co develop inhibitors of pde for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease  including stroke 
this agreement continues work advanced under the agreement  and we will focus on optimizing lead compounds identified under the previous agreement and beginning clinical development 
under this agreement  as of the end of  we received million of research funding 
we will share drug discovery and clinical trials costs under this new agreement  and we may receive an additional million of research funding over the remaining term of the agreement as well as milestone payments and royalties based on drug sales 
diagnostics 
in june  decode signed a five year alliance with roche s diagnostics division to develop and market dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
more recently decode has added research programs aimed at developing diagnostics to predict drug response for major therapeutics used to treat those diseases  in order to help select the most effective treatment of those available 
under the agreement decode has received million in research funding  up front fees and milestone payments 
decode may receive million in additional research funding over the remainder of the term of the agreement as well as milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed 
revenues from these alliances with roche amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred with these collaborative programs with roche amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
merck co  inc merck obesity 
in september  we entered into a three year alliance with merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity 
under the alliance  we combined research efforts with merck in the genetics of obesity to identify  validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development 
during the three year research program  which has now expired  we have received research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of million 
in addition  we may receive further technology access fees in the total aggregate amount of million 
subject to merck s developing products based on collaboration discoveries  we may also receive development milestones and royalties 
we have discovered three genes linked to obesity under this alliance  and merck has generated a lead series of compounds against one of the targets we validated through our genetics research 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
information rich clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an agreement with merck which provides that decode will conduct information rich clinical trials on a range of merck s developmental compounds that merck selects for inclusion in the program 
the term of the alliance is seven years  subject to termination by merck after five years 
the collaboration involved three agreements a a license and research collaboration agreement  b a stock and warrant purchase agreement  and c a warrant agreement 
under the terms of the license and research collaboration agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance  will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market  will receive research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis  and received a one time technology access fee of million 
a contingency clause on the technology access fee provides that if decode rejects the first two non exclusive development compounds that merck presents to the collaboration  then merck has the right to request a refund of  of the technology access fee 
the remaining amount of the technology access fee is non refundable 
to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
the warrant was valued at  using a black scholes model with the following assumptions lives of one to five years  risk free interest rates of to  volatility of and no dividend yield 
the one time technology access fee of  and the  premium received on the sale of common stock less the estimated fair value of the warrant of  together netting to  has been recorded as deferred revenue 
this amount less the refundable amount of   is being recognized as revenue according to level of efforts over the seven year development term 
the refundable  technology access fee will be recognized as revenue according to level of efforts retrospectively over the seven year development term commencing upon satisfaction of the 
to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement that has advanced to patients 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
grant funding we have received various research grants from divisions of the united states national institutes of health nih  the commission of the european communities ec and private foundations 
research grants for multiple years are based on approved budgets with budgeted amounts subject to approval on an annual basis 
nih grants generally provide for reimbursement of allowable expenditures while the grant under the ec generally provides for fifty percent reimbursement of allowable research and development related expenditures 
our significant research contracts include national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 
in september  decode was awarded a five year  contract by the niaid  a division of nih 
under the contract  decode will apply its population approach and resources to discover genetic factors associated with susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and with responsiveness to vaccines targeting such diseases 
decode may receive million in additional research funding over the remaining term of the agreement 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue of million  million and million from research grants 
costs incurred with research grants amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except revenue revenue for the periods presented generally reflects our strategic focus on drug discovery and development 
specifically the increase in revenue in as compared to is mainly due to grant monies earned  service contract fees and the addition of the roche alliance to co develop inhibitors of pde  offset by the completion of research funding under the agreement with roche and the merck obesity research program 
revenue decrease as compared to the period is reflective of the transition of our business from the generation of near term revenue through service partnerships and other means to a greater focus on the development of new drugs in major indications 
at december  we had million in deferred revenue  compared to million at the close of the we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between periods 
cost of revenue  including collaborative programs cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except cost of revenue  including collaborative programs our cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers  collaborators and under grants  including the entirety of the costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which we receive research funding 
at times  we invested in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs 
the decrease in our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs over the periods presented  in general reflects a relative lessening of our investment in programs on which we receive research funding 
our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs in as compared to includes i an overall decrease in direct salary and employee related expenses million  ii less in chemicals and consumables million  which drives iii lower allocation of overheads million and depreciation and amortization million and also an increase in contractor services million 
the lower depreciation and amortization is also due to the sale leaseback of our facilities in iceland during which reduced our depreciation expense 
our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs in as compared to includes i an overall decrease in direct salary and employee related expenses million which drives a ii lower allocation of overheads  depreciation and amortization million  together with iii a relative net benefit of million resulting from chemicals and consumables we used for which there was relatively little or no attendant cost as a result of prior provisions we had made as slow moving  excess or obsolete according to our accounting policy  iv increases in outside contractor services million  and v more in chemicals and consumables million 
although the strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar has somewhat abated during  the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar in and has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  a portion of our salary and employee related expenses included in cost of revenue and may continue to do so 
research and development proprietary programs research and development for proprietary programs for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except research and development proprietary programs the increase in our research and development expenses in proprietary programs results from our emphasis on and increasing expenditures in product development  including pre clinical and clinical work on our lead drug discovery and development programs 
importantly  in we concluded a phase ii trial for dg  our lead developmental compound for the prevention of heart attack and are currently preparing a phase iii clinical for this compound 
in  we also funded and implemented a phase i trials for dg  our developmental compound in peripheral artery disease and co funded a phase ii trial in asthma for a compound developed by another company  a portion of the costs of this trial are included in our research and development expenses for proprietary programs 
further  among other pre clinical programs we are developing a compound to inhibit the lta hydrolase  a protein encoded by a second gene within the same pathway targeted by dg that we have also linked to significantly increased risk of heart attack  and we have begun a pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche 
in  we also initiated a program to develop inhibitors to the ep receptor for prostaglandins e for the management of pain 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and consist of the following salaries and other personnel costs materials and supplies contractor services and other third party costs overhead expenses depreciation and amortization stock based compensation database license fee reversal increases in the research and development costs of our proprietary programs eg  salaries and attendant costs  usage of chemicals and consumables will likely continue  particularly as we advance our clinical development and proprietary drug development programs 
further  we have granted salary increases to our personnel and have added clinical development executives to our staff  which will contribute to future increases in our research and development costs for proprietary programs 
the lower depreciation and amortization is also due to the sale leaseback of our facilities in iceland during which reduced our depreciation expense 
our rent increase will increase due to the above transaction 
this will be offset by the deferred gain on the sale leaseback which is being amortized over the term of the lease 
although the strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar has somewhat abated during  the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar in and has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  a portion of our salary and employee related expenses included in cost of revenue and may continue to do so 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to are essentially unchanged 
salaries and employee related costs did increase million and legal expenses increased with activity around our intellectual property and patent applications million  but then outside contractor service costs have decreased with efficiencies gained in this second year of implementation of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of million 
there is also a relative decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the due to severance costs million and an accrual for probable losses related to grant monies received in pre acquisition periods of medichem million recorded in our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared to  notably including i increased salaries and employee related costs million  ii employee incentives million  iii severance costs million  iv greater travel and overhead expenses million  v recruiting fees related to the addition of new members to our board of directors and also our efforts to hire necessary clinical development and regulatory staff million  vi an accrual for probable losses related to grant monies received in pre acquisition periods of medichem million  offset by lower stock based compensation million 
we also grant annual salary increases to our personnel and are making efforts to recruit new members to our board of directors which will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
although the strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar has somewhat abated during  the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar in and has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  a portion of our salary and employee related expenses included in cost of revenue and may continue to do so 
stock based compensation for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated stock based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option and restricted stock grants 
we value the stock options we grant to non employees using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except cost of revenue  including collaborative programs research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense total stock based compensation with little compensation expense being attributed to our more recent stock option grants  stock based compensation expense has been decreasing as grants made in earlier years become fully vested 
historical stock based compensation is not necessarily representative of the effects on reported income or loss for future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options  the value of stock options that have been granted in recent times and the required change to the fair value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for employee share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method used by decode 
sfas no 
r requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method that would result in expense being recognized in decode s financial statements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a rule that defers the required effective date of sfas no 
r to fiscal years beginning after june  january  for decode 
under sfas no 
r  companies must calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received  pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
decode will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options granted to employees and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
and therefore no compensation expense generally was recognized for these awards 
we expect to incur additional stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations related to unvested stock options granted as of december  and future stock option grants as we adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on periods after adoption cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
because options vest over several years and because we expect to grant options in future years  the pro forma results of applying the provisions of sfas no 
as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily representative of the pro forma results in future years 
at december   we had approximately million of unamortized compensation expense  related to options granted prior to january   to be recognized through  based on the vesting terms of the option agreements and the date the options were granted 
of the million of unamortized compensation expense  approximately million of it will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended december  these amount do not take into consideration any grants subsequent to december  and also do not take into consideration any forfeiture rate discount as proscribed by sfas no

interest income interest income for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest income our interest income has increased with rising rates and increasing returns on a greater amount of cash and investments 
we expect to use our cash and investments principally for advancing our drug and clinical development programs 
in the meantime  we will invest the proceeds received in accordance with our policy  having the objective of preserving principal while maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities  commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest expense our interest expense principally reflects interest on our senior convertible notes due that we issued in april in march  we prepaid million of short and long term debt that was secured by mortgages on sturlugata also in march  we refinanced the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility  paying down million on the existing mortgage 
further  in june  we prepaid million of long term debt that was secured by mortgages on krokhals d and e 
as a result of these prepayments and refinancing  our future interest expense is expected to be approximately million on an annual basis 
other non operating income and expense  net other non operating income and expense for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except other non operating income and expense  net our other non operating income and expense  net consists principally of the net impact of foreign exchange  unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and  in  loss on early extinguishment of debt and a realized loss on the sale of investments 
as a consequence of the nature of our business and operations  our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our losses on derivative financial instruments in million resulted from three forward foreign currency exchange options we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our isk denominated operating expenses but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
our losses on derivative financial instruments in stem from the two cross currency swaps we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency debt but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in march  we liquidated our two cross currency swaps receiving million in proceeds 
we realized a loss on this early termination that  together with unrealized losses on the swaps during the  amounted to million 
as a result of having prepaid the short and long term debts that were secured by mortgages on sturlugata we have recorded a loss on early extinguishment debt during amounting to million and consisting of i prepayment fees million  ii write off of remaining unamortized finance costs million  and iii remaining unamortized discount on the long term debt million 
in december  we sold investments and realized a loss on the sale of million 
income taxes as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and did not owe any icelandic or us federal income taxes nor did we pay any in the years ended december   or realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income in the united states that expire at various dates through also  as of december  our foreign subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in varying amounts beginning in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except net loss basic and diluted net loss per share net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share both increased in the years ended december  and  principally on account of higher research and development related to the advancement of our drug development programs  lower revenues  higher interest expense related to our convertible notes issued in april and the impact  both realized and unrealized  of foreign exchange fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from research and development collaborative agreements  and the issuance of equity securities and long term financing instruments million from the beginning of to date 
future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments  royalties and other payments that we may earn under such collaborations 
we make significant investments in proprietary research and development and we incur the costs of such activities 
in the near term  this requires us to devote resources to our in house drug and clinical development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
the decisions we make as to these matters will affect our cash requirements 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the level and timing of our research and development expenditures  our ability to access the capital markets  to obtain new research and development collaboration agreements  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our pharmaceuticals  biostructures  clinical research trials and genotyping service groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  and capital expenditures at our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  notably the entry into clinical trials of drugs based on our discoveries  or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
in december  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale from time to time of debt and equity securities either individually or in units  in one or more offerings  with a total value of up to million 
as of december   we had not consummated any sales under this registration statement 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as we advance and broaden our drug development pipeline we will require significant additional capital for product development and so we will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing  such as further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing  other forms of financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of a urdur verdandi skuld ehf 
uvs  a privately held cancer research firm  from iceland genomics corporation  inc igc  both companies having their principal offices in reykjavik  iceland 
as consideration for the purchase  we issued  shares of decode common stock valued at  to igc 
this acquisition will allow us to broaden our cancer program by applying our gene discovery and drug development efforts to a larger population 
this acquisition will not have a material impact on our capital requirements in the future 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash and cash equivalents  at end of period cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
together with our investments at december  million  this balance is approximately million less than at december  significant cash flows during the year ended december  include  the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback financing of our sturlugata headquarters facility million  the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback financing of our krokhals facility million  prepayments of short and long term debts secured by mortgages on sturlugata million  prepayments of short and long term debts secured by mortgages on our krokhals facility million  refinancing of the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility million  other debt service million  capital expenditures million  and costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million of cash we used in operating activities during the year ended december  available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity and safety of principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing a a or better 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities 
at december   our cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
at december   our investments are comprised of auction rate securities and a corporate bond 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as more fully described above  the increase in use of cash in operating activities is most importantly attributable to the significant research and development investments being made in advancing our drug and clinical development programs 
the balance of our deferred revenue has decreased during as we recognize revenue as work progresses under collaborative contracts with significant up front monies paid 
also  during  we have experienced lower average turnover of our receivables largely on account of monies due under grants 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of short term investments in marketable securities consisting mainly of auction rate securities  us government securities and in an intermediate term bond mutual fund  capital expenditures and  in the year ended december   the sale and leaseback of our headquarters facilities at sturlugata  and krokhals d and e in reykjavik  iceland 
we principally made replacement capital expenditures during  and and did invest in certain computer and laboratory equipment 
we have experienced the pace of necessary capital expenditures increase somewhat of late and this trend may continue 
although we believe we will continue to make largely replacement capital expenditures in the near term  net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to timing of our capital expenditures and other investments as well as changing business needs 
as more fully described below  in march  we entered into a financing with an icelandic real estate company for the sale and leaseback of our headquarters facility at sturlugata  reykjavik  iceland 
the sale price for the property was billion icelandic kronas million after taking into account a standard forward foreign exchange contact we entered into in connection with the sale 
in june  we entered into a financing with an icelandic real estate company for the sale and leaseback of our facility at krokhals d and e  reykjavik  iceland 
the sale price for the property was million icelandic kronas approximately million after taking into account the sales commission 
financing activities 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in the year ended december   as compared to million that was provided in the year ended december  and million that was provided in the year ended december  financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of prepayments of short and long term debts secured by mortgages on sturlugata million  prepayments of long term debts secured by mortgages on krokhals d and e million refinancing of the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility million which freed up million of previously restricted cash reflected above in investing activities  the sale and leaseback of certain equipment million and other debt service million 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of net proceeds from our convertible notes million  equity proceeds and the portion of the monies received by us in the information rich clinical trial alliance with merck relating to the sale of common stock and warrants million  proceeds in the liquidation of our two cross currency swaps million and installment payments on debt and capital lease obligations million 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters facility at sturlugata went to prepay approximately million of long term debt that was secured by mortgages on the property  our tier a bonds  tier b loan and march loan and million of short term borrowings 
we have leased the property back under a year non cancelable lease agreement at a rent of million icelandic kronas per month approximately million as of december   subject to changes based on the icelandic consumer price index 
under the terms of the lease we will continue to pay property taxes and insurance and will be responsible for the property s maintenance 
the monthly rent will be revised as of july  to reflect changes in capital markets as well as our credit quality 
under the terms of the lease  we have a right of first refusal on any sale of the property and a priority right to extend the term of the lease at its expiration 
the lease provides us with the option to redenominate the rent in currencies other than icelandic kronas at a predetermined rate as of july  in march  we refinanced the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility  paying down million of the then existing million mortgage and eliminating restricted cash collateral totaling million 
the principal amount of the new mortgage million is payable in monthly installments of  for two years and three months with a final payment of million due in june the new mortgage carries an interest rate of three month libor at december  
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of krokhals d and e were used to prepay approximately million of long term debt that was secured by a mortgage on the property 
decode has leased the krokhals d and e property back under a year non cancelable lease agreement at a rent of million icelandic kronas approximately million as of december  per month  subject to changes based on the icelandic consumer price index 
the lease is a year operating lease 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands senior convertible notes  including interest operating leases long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements  decode is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products 
these payments could total million  of which decode believes million may be incurred in  with the timing of payments of the remainder not determinable at the current time 
these potential payments are not included in the above table 
all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
we do not have any other significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
additionally  holders of our senior convertible notes may elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time at a price of per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  due to the nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible notes  because they bear interest at a fixed rate 
the market value of the convertible notes was million on december  as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk 
a hypothetical decrease in value of the us dollar against the icelandic krona would result in a loss of approximately million on our icelandic krona denominated non us dollar assets and liabilities 
we have historically purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments  however  we have no derivative instruments outstanding as of december  as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
