item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration and exploitation activities in the states of oklahoma  texas  new mexico and kansas 
over the last four years  we have emphasized the acquisition of properties that provided current production and upside potential through further development 
we have increased our reserves significantly by investing approximately million in acquisitions and enhancements in  following total capital expenditures of approximately million in and approximately million in our capital budget for is approximately million for development of existing properties 
we also intend to continue seeking acquisition opportunities which compliment our current portfolio 
we intend to fund our development activity primarily through use of cash flow from operations and cash on hand  while potential drawings on our credit facility and proceeds from future equity transactions would also be available for development projects or future acquisitions 
our business plan has involved increasing our base of proven reserves until we have acquired a sufficient core to enable us to utilize cash from existing production to fund further development activities 
when we originated our business plan we believed this would allow us to lessen our risks  including risks associated with borrowing funds to undertake exploration activities at an earlier time 
as we have now increased our base of proven properties  and as oil and natural gas prices have recently significantly risen  we have initiated our development activities 
while our focus has shifted to include more development activity  we plan to continue our strategy of acquiring producing properties with additional development  exploitation and exploration potential 
our focus has been on acquiring operated properties ie properties with respect to which we serve as the operator on behalf of all joint interest owners so that we can better control the timing and implementation of capital spending 
in addition  our willingness to acquire non operated properties in new geographic regions may provide us with geophysical and geologic data in some cases that leads to further acquisitions in the same region  whether on an operated or non operated basis 
our revenue  profitability and future growth rate depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
in a worst case scenario  future drilling operations could be largely unsuccessful  oil and gas prices could sharply decline and or other factors beyond our control could cause us to greatly modify or substantially curtail our development plans  which could negatively impact our earnings  cash flow and most likely the trading price of our securities  as well as the acceleration of debt repayment and a reduction in our borrowing base under our credit facilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated for the years ended december  net production oil bbls    natural gas mcf    net sales oil    natural gas    average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf production costs and expenses oil and gas production costs    production taxes    depreciation  depletion and amortization expense    accretion expense    general and administrative expenses    year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in oil sales increased million and natural gas sales increased million 
the oil sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  barrels in  and a increase in the average realized per barrel oil price from in to in these per barrel amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold  in barrels 
the natural gas sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  mcf in and a increase in the average realized natural gas price per mcf from in to in these per mcf amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold  in mcf 
the volume increase for crude oil and natural gas primarily resulted from acquisitions made in and development of our existing properties in oil and gas production costs 
our aggregate oil and gas production costs increased from  in to  although such expenses on a boe basis declined from in to in these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs by our total volume sold  in boe 
this aggregate increase was the result of having the properties acquired in in our operations for a full year in  and the drilling of new wells in and cost increases 
the decline on a per boe basis is attributable to consolidation of resources available due to our growth 
oil and gas production taxes 
oil and gas production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were during and increased to in production taxes vary from state to state 
therefore  these taxes are likely to vary in the future depending on the mix of production we generate from various states  and on the possibility that any state may raise its production tax 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  to  in the increase was a result of an increase in the average depreciation  depletion and amortization rate from per boe during to per boe during these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by our total volume sold  in boe 
the increased depreciation  depletion and amortization was the result of increased sales volume and an increase in estimated future development costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  during this increase was primarily related to increases in compensation expense associated with an increase in personnel required to administer our growth 
other financing expense 
other financing expense was  in  compared to in the increase is a result of the offering to which the financing expenses relate that occurred in interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  in the increase was due to higher amounts of debt being outstanding during periods of the year in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was during and during net income 
net income increased from  for to  for the primary reasons for this increase include higher crude oil and natural gas prices between periods and an increase in volumes sold  partially offset by higher oil and gas production costs  oil and gas production taxes and general and administrative expenses due to our growth 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in oil sales increased million and natural gas sales increased  the oil sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  barrels in  and a increase in the average realized per barrel oil price from in to in these per barrel amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold  in barrels 
the natural gas sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  mcf in and a increase in the average realized natural gas price per mcf from in to in these per mcf amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold  in mcf 
the volume increase for crude oil and natural gas primarily resulted from million of capital expenditures during  of which approximately million were related to our acquisition of the east hobbs and fuhrman mascho properties 
oil and gas production costs 
our aggregate oil and gas production costs increased from  in to   although such expenses on a boe basis declined slightly from in to in these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs by our total volume sold  in boe 
this aggregate increase was the result of having the properties acquired in in our operations for a full year in  acquiring new properties and accounting for them for a portion of the year in and cost increases 
the decline on a per boe basis is attributable to consolidation of resources available due to our growth 
oil and gas production taxes 
oil and gas production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were during and remained steady at in production taxes vary from state to state 
therefore  these taxes are likely to vary in the future depending on the mix of production we generate from various states  and on the possibility that any state may raise its production tax 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  to  in the increase was a result of an increase in the average depreciation  depletion and amortization rate from per boe during to per boe during these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by our total volume sold  in boe 
the increased depreciation  depletion and amortization was the result of increased sales volume and an increase in estimated future development costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  during this increase was primarily related to increases in compensation expense associated with an increase in personnel required to administer our growth  legal fees of  annual listing fees of   in fees paid to lee keeling for reserve reports  fees related to obtaining our credit facility and letters of credit and directors fees 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  in the increase was due to higher amounts of debt being outstanding during periods of the year in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was during and during cumulative change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and requires us to recognize the fair value of asset retirement obligations in our financial statements by capitalizing that cost as a part of the cost of the related asset 
this statement applies directly to the plug and abandonment liabilities associated with our net working interest in well bores 
the additional carrying amount is depleted over the estimated lives of the properties 
the discounted liability is based on historical abandonment costs in specific areas and is accreted at the end of each accounting period through charges to accretion expense 
the liability is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of approximately 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an increase to our discounted abandonment liability of  increased proved property cost by  and recognized a one time cumulative effect charge of  net of a related tax effect of 
the effect of adopting this accounting principle was a  after tax decrease in net income during net income 
net income increased from  for to  for the primary reasons for this increase include higher crude oil and natural gas prices between periods and an increase in volumes sold  partially offset by higher oil and gas production costs  oil and gas production taxes and general and administrative expenses due to our growth 
liquidity and capital resources historical financing 
we have historically funded our operations through loans from our executive officers  our initial public offering of stock in  private equity offerings of our stock and warrants and our secondary offering of common stock and warrants which we closed in august credit facility 
on april   we established a  credit facility with our principal lenders with an  initial borrowing base 
in april  we entered into an agreement that increased the facility to  with an increased borrowing base of  any increases in the borrowing base are subject to written consent by the financial institution 
the interest rate is a floating rate equal to the  or day libor rate plus  currently per annum  and is payable monthly 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility are due on april  the revolving credit facility is secured by our principal mineral interests 
in order to obtain the revolving credit facility  loans from two officers were subordinated to the position of the bank 
we are required under the terms of the credit facility to maintain a tangible net worth of  maintain a to ratio of income before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization to interest expense and maintain a current asset to current liability ratio of to at december   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility  though  is reserved under the revolving credit facility as collateral for standby letters of credit issued to various states 
cash flows 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and equity offerings 
during the three years ended december   we generated  from operating activities  financed  through proceeds from the sale of stock and warrants  and  from debt obligations owed to two officers  for a total of  we primarily used this cash generation to fund our capital expenditures and development aggregating  over the three years 
at december   we had cash on hand of  and working capital of  compared to december  when our cash was  and working capital of  we continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources 
our budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  for development of our current properties 
we expect to fund these expenditures as well as any future property acquisitions from cash on hand  internally generated cash flow during the year  proceeds from future equity transactions and from borrowings under our credit facility  if required 
the level of capital expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly depending on available opportunities  commodity prices  cash flows and development results  among others 
schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our future estimated principal and minimum debt and lease payments for periods subsequent to december  year long term debt lease obligation total cash obligation total    off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
new accounting policies effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize the fair value of asset retirement obligations in our financial statements by capitalizing that cost as a part of the cost of the related asset 
in regards to us  this statement applies directly to the plug and abandonment liabilities associated with our net working interest in well bores 
the additional carrying amount is depleted over the estimated lives of the properties 
the discounted liability is based on historical abandonment costs in specific areas and is accreted at the end of each accounting period through charges to accretion expense 
the liability is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of approximately 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an increase to our discounted abandonment liability of  increased property and equipment cost by  and recognized a one time cumulative effect charge of  net of a deferred tax benefit of 
the adoption of sfas no 
also affected the depreciation  depletion and amortization on an on going basis 
the additionally capitalized amount for the discounted abandonment liability increases the base amount used in calculating depletion 
this effect was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization for the years ended december   and of   and  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
also impacted the way the ceiling test is calculated under the full cost accounting method used by the company  in that an estimation of future abandonment costs are now excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
however  these costs are now part of the base amount  so while the way the calculation is performed has changed  the end result remains the same 
there were no other impacts of the adoption of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation establishes the requirement for a primary beneficiary to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not have an interest in a variable interest entity and the adoption of the statement did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement was effective for us in july the statement requires financial instruments to be classified as liabilities if the financial instruments are issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable or embody an obligation to repurchase equity shares 
we issued a put option in exchange for oil and gas property interests in december the put option was originally classified as a liability  therefore  the adoption of the statement did not have an impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
revenue recognition 
we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received  however  differences have been insignificant 
full cost method of accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
costs capitalized include acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  lease rentals on undeveloped properties and cost of drilling and equipping productive and non productive wells 
drilling costs include directly related overhead costs 
all of our properties are located within the continental united states 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this annual report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve information included in this annual report is based on estimates prepared by lee keeling and associates  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we continually make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional properties are acquired 
we make changes to depletion rates and impairment calculations in the same period that changes to the reserve estimates are made 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and estimated future costs of site restoration  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves as determined by independent engineers 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
we review the value of our oil and natural gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
we provide for impairments on undeveloped property when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
impairments of proved producing properties are calculated by comparing future net undiscounted cash flows on a field by field basis using escalated prices to the net recorded book cost at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds net future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using net discounted future cash flows from the producing property 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
we have never recorded any property impairments 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is settled 
since our tax returns are filed after the financial statements are prepared  estimates are required in valuing tax assets and liabilities 
we record adjustments to actual in the period we file our tax returns 
effects of inflation and pricing as in  we did experience continued increases in cost during due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry puts extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs  and this proved to be the case in as oil and gas prices rose significantly 
costs for oilfield services and materials increased during due to higher demand as a result of the higher oil and gas prices 
material changes in prices impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans and value of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
we anticipate the increased business costs will continue while the commodity prices for oil and natural gas  and the demand for services related to production and exploration  both remain high from an historical context in the near term 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk we have not historically entered into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
normal hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods the prices we would receive for the volumes and commodity to which the hedge relates 
consequently  while hedges are designed to decrease exposure to price decreases  they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases 
interest rate risk our current credit facility has a floating interest rate 
therefore  as a result of our draws on this credit facility  interest rate changes will impact future results of operations and cash flows
