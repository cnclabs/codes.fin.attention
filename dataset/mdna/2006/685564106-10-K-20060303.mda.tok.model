item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  segment results  liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this form k include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors may affect actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
historical results of operations may not be indicative of future operating results 
we develop and manufacture small rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products are satellites and launch vehicles  including low orbit  geosynchronous orbit and planetary spacecraft for communications  remote sensing  scientific and military missions  ground and air launched rockets that deliver satellites into orbit  and missile defense systems that are used as interceptor and target vehicles 
we also offer space related technical services to government agencies and develop and build satellite based transportation management systems for public transit agencies and private vehicle fleet operators 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
should performance under such contracts differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could therefore fluctuate significantly 
as of december   unbilled receivables included million of incentive fees on certain satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
additionally  some satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied and  as of december   up to million of revenues recognized under such contracts could be reversed if satellite performance criteria were not met 
we generally procure insurance policies that would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for performance refund obligations 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
cost is determined on an average cost or specific identification basis 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we record a liability in connection with certain warranty obligations 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by million revenue growth in our launch vehicles segment and million growth in our satellites and related space systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our transportation management systems segment 
the launch vehicles segment growth was driven by higher revenues in the interceptor launch vehicles and target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by lower revenues in the space launch vehicles product line 
the satellites and related space systems segment growth was driven by significantly higher revenues in the communications satellites product line  offset partially by lower revenues from science  technology and defense satellite contracts and space technical services 
transportation management systems segment revenues decreased due to the completion or near completion of certain contracts 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  a increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in  as compared to  was due to a million  or  increase in our launch vehicles segment  a million  or  increase in our satellites and related space systems segment and a million  or  increase in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in gross profit in our launch vehicles segment was primarily attributable to a higher profit from the interceptor launch vehicles product line due to increased activity levels in and cost growth on taurus and pegasus rocket contracts recorded in that did not recur in these increases were partially offset by cost growth on certain contracts in the increase in gross profit in our satellites and related space systems segment was largely due to million of revenue and profit recorded in the second quarter of related to satellite acceptance and incentive fees received from a customer and former affiliate 
although revenues were higher in our satellites and related space systems segment  profit was lower in due to significant cost growth on our communication satellites contracts 
the increase in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to improved profitability on certain transportation management systems contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in both and these expenses related primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was driven by increases in bid  proposal and marketing costs  higher legal fees and expenses and increased personnel related costs 
the increase in bid  proposal and marketing costs was driven by satellite and launch vehicle proposal efforts in legal fees and expenses related to the us government investigation initiated in and described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements totaled approximately million in personnel related costs increased largely due to higher staff levels and  in part  due to the expense related to an equity based compensation arrangement initiated in  discussed in more detail below 
settlement expense in  we recorded a million gain as a credit to settlement expense in connection with the sale of senior subordinated notes which we had received in from a former affiliate 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense in remained relatively consistent with interest expense in primarily as a result of our unchanged fixed rate debt balance during interest income and other interest income and other was million and million in and  respectively  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher short term invested cash balances 
debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses associated with repurchases of a portion of our senior notes and the replacement of our bank credit agreement as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes in the fourth quarter of  we reversed nearly all of our deferred tax valuation allowance due to our assessment that substantially all of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable  as discussed more fully in the section compared with below 
this resulted in our recording significantly higher income tax expense beginning in  nearly all of which is offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  resulting in minimal cash tax payments 
our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum tax amt  are currently less than of pretax income 
we recorded million of income tax expense in  reflecting an annualized effective income tax rate of 
the million net income tax benefit recorded in was comprised of i million in deferred tax benefit in connection with the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed below and ii a million current provision for amt and state tax obligations 
net income our consolidated net income was million and million  or and diluted earnings per share  in and  respectively 
the decrease in net income in was due to a million increase in pretax income  offset by the impact of the million net income tax benefit in compared to the million income tax expense in compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by a million revenue growth in our satellites and related space systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment and a million decrease in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in satellites and related space systems segment revenues was largely attributable to increased revenues from science  technology and defense satellite contracts 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  a increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in  as compared to  was driven by a million increase in our satellites and related space systems segment and a million improvement in our transportation management systems segment  partially offset by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment 
the increase in our satellites and related space systems segment was primarily due to profit derived from the significant revenue growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line  offset by lower profit in the communications satellites product line 
the improvement in our transportation management systems segment was mainly attributable to the absence in of cost increases and other charges recorded in on certain transportation management systems contracts 
the decrease in gross profit in our launch vehicles segment was due to the completion of certain advanced space flight systems contracts in and lower profit in our space launch vehicles product line  offset partially by profit growth from our missile defense interceptor program 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
these expenses related primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased largely due to a million reduction in bid and proposal costs and million of non recurring litigation expenses in our transportation management systems segment in settlement expense in  we recorded a million gain as a credit to settlement expense in connection with the sale of senior subordinated notes which we had received in from a former affiliate 
in  we recorded million of settlement charges in connection with the settlement of litigation between a former affiliate and orbital 
these charges included a million delay penalty related to the orbview satellite and a million litigation settlement payment 
also in  we recorded a million reduction in settlement expense in connection with the settlement of an action we had brought against certain of our insurers seeking reimbursement for defense and settlement costs we had incurred several years earlier defending a breach of contract lawsuit 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of a lower interest rate on our debt and a reduction in the amortization of debt costs resulting from our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of interest income and other interest income and other was million and million in and  respectively  consisting largely of interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
gain on reversal of allocated losses of affiliate in  we recorded a million gain in connection with the reversal of our previously recorded liability related to the allocated losses of a former affiliate 
this gain was recorded as a result of the cancellation of our ownership interest in connection with the former affiliate s reorganization in december debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses associated with repurchases of a portion of our senior notes and the replacement of our bank credit agreement as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
in  we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses associated with debt refinancing in july the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt discount on our notes issued in august  million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income taxes the million net tax benefit recorded in was comprised of i the million deferred income tax benefit in connection with the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed below and ii a million current income tax provision for alternative minimum taxes and state tax obligations 
in  the benefit recorded for income taxes was solely attributable to the refund of state income taxes paid in in prior years and until the fourth quarter of  we had recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets based on our assessment that the realization of our net deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december  we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our cumulative taxable income in recent years and our expected profitability in future years  substantially all of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  as of december  we reversed million of our deferred income tax valuation allowance and recorded i a tax benefit of million in our consolidated income statement  ii a million reduction in goodwill and iii a million increase to additional paid in capital 
the portion of the reversal recorded as a reduction in goodwill relates to valuation allowances established in prior years in connection with business acquisitions 
the portion of the reversal recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital is primarily related to tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in and prior years 
net income our consolidated net income was million  or diluted earnings per share  and million  or diluted earnings per share  in and  respectively 
the increase in net income in consisted of a million increase in pretax income  plus the million income tax benefit in discussed above 
segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable segments i launch vehicles  ii satellites and related space systems  and iii transportation management systems 
corporate office transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following table summarizes revenues and income from operations for our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other settlement expense total compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues increased primarily due to a million revenue increase from our interceptor launch vehicles product line and a million revenue increase from our target launch vehicles product line  partially offset by a million revenue decrease in our space launch vehicles product line 
in our interceptor launch vehicles product line  we are developing and manufacturing interceptor boosters designed to defend against ballistic missile attacks  including the midcourse phase orbital boost vehicle obv and the boost phase kinetic energy interceptors kei programs directed by the us missile defense agency 
the obv and kei programs accounted for million and million in revenues  or and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues in our target launch vehicles product line increased primarily due to a higher level of activity on target vehicles in revenues decreased in our space launch vehicles product line primarily due to lower levels of activity on taurus and minotaur programs and on the dart mission launched in april also contributing to the decrease in our space launch vehicles product line was a non recurring million early termination fee in in connection with a taurus contract cancellation  partially offset by increased activity in on pegasus programs 
we completed one pegasus launch during compared to no pegasus launches in  and we completed no taurus launches in compared to one taurus launch in operating income in the launch vehicles segment increased primarily due to improved operating results in the interceptor launch vehicles and the space launch vehicles product lines 
operating income from our interceptor launch vehicles product line was the largest contributor to this segment s operating income  reporting million  or  of total segment operating profit in  compared to million  or  in the profit growth in interceptors was driven by higher activity levels in while space launch vehicles revenues were lower  operating profit improved in this product line due to increased activity on pegasus programs and significant cost growth in on a pegasus contract and a taurus contract that did not recur in  offset partially by the million contract termination fee in discussed above 
although target launch vehicles revenues were higher  operating results declined marginally in this product line primarily due to cost growth impacting several contracts 
segment operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the increase in operating margin was primarily the result of improved interceptor launch vehicles margins and the impact of the contract cost growth discussed above  offset partially by million of investigation related legal expenses discussed previously that are reflected in the launch vehicles segment financial results in satellites and related space systems satellites and related space systems segment revenues increased as a result of a million increase in revenues in our communications satellites product line  partially offset by a million decrease in our science  technology and defense satellite product line and a million decrease in space technical services revenues 
revenues increased in our communications satellites product line due to revenues on several recently awarded geosynchronous orbit satellite contracts begun in communications satellites revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues decreased in our science  technology and defense satellites product line as a result of a decline in activity on certain contracts that were in the latter stages of production in  offset partially by million of revenue recorded in the second quarter of related to satellite acceptance and incentive fees received from a customer and former affiliate 
revenues from space technical services declined largely due to lower levels of program activity 
operating income in the satellites and related space systems segment decreased million due to a million decrease in operating results in the communications satellites product line  partially offset by higher income in our other product lines 
the decline in communications satellites operating results was primarily due to significant cost growth on certain contracts in  partially offset by operating income from the contracts begun in mentioned previously  resulting in an operating loss in the communications satellites product line in the increase in our other product lines was primarily due to million of operating profit from the satellite acceptance and incentive fees discussed above offset partially by lower income on certain science  technology and defense contracts driven by lower activity levels 
segment operating margin was in  compared to in the decrease in operating margin was largely due to the communications satellite cost growth noted above 
transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues decreased in compared to largely due to completion or near completion of certain contracts  partially offset by revenues from several recently awarded contracts 
although revenues decreased  operating income increased million largely due to higher profit rates in from recently awarded contracts 
this improved profitability was partially offset by a million charge to reserve a note receivable in and by the absence in of a favorable revenue adjustment in on a contract that was renegotiated and resumed in corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating income in was comprised solely of the first quarter gain on the sale of notes received from a former affiliate discussed above 
in  we granted to employees  restricted stock units rsu valued at each 
each rsu entitles the holder to receive one share of common stock on the date of vesting 
the cost of these units is amortized over a three year vesting period and we recorded million of such amortization expense in this expense and the related profit impact is allocated among all our reportable business segments 
compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from certain advanced space flight systems contracts that were completed in and a million decrease in our space launch vehicle product line  offset partially by a million increase in our obv missile defense interceptor program 
the obv program accounted for million and million in revenues  or and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in our space launch vehicle product line was primarily due to lower pegasus and taurus program revenues 
we completed four pegasus launches during compared to no pegasus launches in  and we completed one taurus launch in may compared to no taurus launches in the reduction in launch vehicle program activity in was partially offset by a million early termination fee recognized in connection with a taurus contract that was cancelled by the customer in december due to a change in the customer s plans prior to our commencing any significant work on the contract 
revenues in our target vehicle product line were relatively unchanged in as compared to operating income decreased due to the completion of certain advanced space flight systems contracts in and lower profit in our space launch vehicles product line  offset partially by increased income from our obv missile defense interceptor program 
operating income from our obv missile defense interceptor program was million in  or of total segment income  compared to million  or of total segment income  in our space launch vehicle product line operating income decreased due to lower program activity  as discussed above  and significant cost growth in on a pegasus contract and a taurus contract  offset partially by the million contract termination fee discussed above 
operating income in our target vehicle product line was relatively unchanged in compared to the segment s total operating margin was in compared to in satellites and related space systems satellites and related space systems segment revenues increased primarily as a result of revenue growth of million in our science  technology and defense satellite product line and million from space technical services  offset partially by an million revenue reduction in our communications satellites product line 
the revenue increase in our science  technology and defense satellite product line was primarily due to million in revenues from defense related contracts awarded in and late  together with revenue growth of million from the dawn interplanetary mission contract with nasa and million from a new nasa scientific satellite contract started late in revenues decreased million to million in our communications satellites product line primarily as a result of the completion of the bsat c and panamsat galaxy xii satellites in and lower program activity in on the telkom satellite contract  partially offset by revenues from a new contract for two communications satellites awarded in late operating income increased largely as a result of a million increase in profits derived from the revenue growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line  partially offset by a million decrease in profits in our communications satellites product line 
the decrease in communications satellites income in was primarily attributable to the completion and launch of the bsat c satellite and the receipt of a million fee associated with the cancellation of a contract in and an operating loss in on a new contract awarded in late these negative factors were partially offset by favorable profit adjustments on certain other communications satellites contracts 
the profit growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line reflects the revenue growth in this product line in addition to the absence in of million of charges recorded in for increases in the costs to complete the orbview satellite contract 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues decreased largely due to a reduction in activity on a contract that was substantially completed in the third quarter of this was partially offset by a million favorable revenue adjustment on a previously suspended contract that was renegotiated and resumed in the third quarter of operating results improved from a million loss in to million income in this improvement was primarily attributable to significant cost growth in that did not recur in and a million favorable operating income adjustment in from the resumed contract mentioned above 
the charges included million of inventory related charges  million of non recurring litigation expenses and million of unfavorable adjustments as a result of cost increases on a number of contracts 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating income in was comprised solely of the first quarter gain on the sale of notes received from a former affiliate discussed above 
in  corporate and other operating results included million of settlement expense discussed in consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities in was million as compared to million in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to a million increase in changes in assets and liabilities 
receivables  inventories and other assets decreased million in  compared to a million decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses  deferred revenue and other liabilities increased million in compared to a million increase in cash flow from operating activities increased million in as compared to primarily attributable to  and consistent with  the year over year growth in income adjusted for the impact of non cash transactions 
cash flow from investing activities in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we reduced restricted cash by million  resulting in a net million use of cash for investing activities 
in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we reduced restricted cash by million  resulting in a net million use of cash for investing activities 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of restricted cash  primarily associated with letters of credit issued by financial institutions on our behalf 
in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we increased restricted cash by million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a million cash receipt from an escrow account  resulting in a net million use of cash for investing activities 
cash flow from financing activities in  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
in  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and warrant exercises 
the activity included million received from the exercise of million common stock warrants prior to their expiration date in during  we repurchased and cancelled million of our senior notes at a cost of million  and we expended million to obtain a new credit facility discussed below 
in december  we replaced our previous line of credit with a million revolving credit facility the revolver with the option to increase the amount of the revolver up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to be a lender for such amount 
loans under the revolver bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to or at a prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to  with the applicable margin in each case varying according to our ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the revolver is collateralized by our intellectual property and accounts receivable 
up to million of the revolver may be reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver  although million of letters of credit were issued under the revolver 
accordingly  as of december   million of the revolver was available for borrowing 
in july  we closed two financing transactions 
in the first transaction  we issued million of senior notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july  starting in during the third quarter of  we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with available cash on hand  to repurchase or redeem all of our million second priority secured notes due in the second transaction  we replaced our previous million revolving line of credit with a million revolving line of credit that was subsequently replaced in december  as described above 
in  we entered into an eight year interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million  whereby the company would receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
this arrangement was designated an effective fair value hedge of million of our senior notes due in june  we terminated the swap agreement 
our senior notes due and the revolver contain covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  pay cash dividends  make investments  redeem or repurchase orbital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others and dispose of assets or create liens on assets 
in addition  the revolver contains financial covenants with respect to leverage  secured leverage  fixed charge coverage  consolidated net worth and the ratio of accounts receivable to senior secured indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
the following table sets forth our long term obligations  excluding capital lease obligations in thousands december  senior notes  interest due semi annually  principal due in july interest rate swap fair value hedge adjustment on million of senior notes less current portion long term portion the fair value of our senior notes at december  was estimated at million  based on market trading activity 
available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the revolver will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our outstanding debt 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in april  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding securities over a month period 
we may repurchase our senior notes due  common stock or common stock warrants that expire in  or a combination thereof 
shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market  by block purchase or in negotiated transactions 
the warrants and notes may be purchased in negotiated transactions 
the timing  amount and type of securities to be repurchased will be determined based on our loan covenants  market conditions and other factors 
as described above  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million during under this securities purchase program 
as of december   million of additional possible repurchases are authorized for aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes orbital s contractual obligations at december   both on and off balance sheet  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total our obligations under operating leases consist of minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office space and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of open purchase orders that we issued to acquire materials  parts or services in future periods 
occasionally  certain contracts require us to post letters of credit supporting our performance obligations under the contracts 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding at december   of which million was collateralized by our restricted cash and million was issued under the revolver 
off balance sheet arrangements we believe that we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by applicable securities regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources
