item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in risk factors and other factors 

table of contents overview we are the largest publicly traded truckload carrier in the united states operating a fleet of  tractors and  trailers and traveling nearly million miles every week 
we operate predominantly in one industry  road transportation  as a truckload motor carrier and thus have only one reportable segment 
we earn revenue by hauling freight for retailers  manufacturers and other companies 
we manage our business through a network of major terminals located strategically across the united states and mexico 
we believe our terminal network provides us with efficiencies such as enabling in house maintenance and utilizing company purchased fuel  as well as providing superior customer service by being located closer to our customers 
our services include dry van  refrigerated van  flat bed  heavy haul  dedicated and intermodal offerings 
the principal types of freight we transport include retail and discount department store merchandise  manufactured goods  paper products  non perishable and perishable food  beverages and beverage containers and building materials 
principally  we operate within short to medium haul traffic lanes with an average length of haul of less than miles 
in  we restructured our us operations and created three regions east  west and central each with an operational executive vice president responsible for all aspects of sales  planning and network management  and operations within a region 
we believe this operational realignment helped drive improvements in our operational metrics in also in  we began the expansion of our intermodal service offering 
we expect to continue this expansion in our intermodal operation utilizes railroads to perform transportation services 
in the past few years  the truckload industry has generally experienced increases in driver wages due to competition among carriers for qualified drivers  increases in fuel costs due to less efficient epa approved engines in the tractors and higher crude oil prices  and increases in insurance costs 
the availability of drivers and the cost increases have tightened the capacity growth in the industry while demand from shippers has increased 
this has enabled us and other carriers to pass through many of our cost increases to the customers through higher rates 
our ability to continue to pass through these cost increases and retain qualified drivers could have a major impact on the results of our operations and financial condition in the future 
given the current market environment  we will continue to focus on driver retention  safety  rate negotiations with our customers  freight selection and other activities that we expect will enable us to continue our profitable growth 
sale of autohaul business and assets in april  we completed the sale of our autohaul assets and business for approximately million  million of which was paid in cash at closing  million of which was paid on july   million of which was paid on january  and million of which is payable to us in the form of a note due over a six year period ending in april as part of this transaction  we provided certain bookkeeping and other related services to the buyer on a transitional basis through december we will continue to provide certain information technology support through april we believe this sale will allow us to focus more on our core business 
fmcsa hours of service regulations the fmcsa revised their hos regulations effective january to increase the maximum daily drive time from to hours  but no longer allowed for breaks in the on duty period 
we believe that these changes may have caused productivity losses as there is wait time while the tractors are loaded  unloaded or otherwise detained which cannot be recovered with additional drive time 
this also has an impact on our driver wages since they are paid primarily on the number of trip miles 
in such situations  we have worked with our shippers to try to minimize the loss of productivity 
when necessary  we have billed our shippers for accessorial charges and in turn compensated our drivers and owner operators accordingly so as to maintain our existing pay structure 
the fmcsa then issued new hos regulations effective october in general  the regulations did not reduce the amount of available driving hours  but restricted the sleeper berth provision 
the new sleeper berth provision allows the drivers required rest period of hours to be split into two parts  but requires one 
table of contents period to be at least consecutive hours 
these changes could impact the flexibility of solo and team drivers to effectively manage their available work hours 
if we are unsuccessful in working with customers on the timing of pickups and deliveries or in working with drivers to optimize their available driving hours  the changes could result in a loss of productivity 
safety rating update our safety rating is satisfactory  the highest rating given by the fmcsa 
there are three safety ratings assigned to motor carriers satisfactory  conditional  which means that there are deficiencies requiring correction  but not so significant to warrant loss of carrier authority and unsatisfactory  which is the result of acute deficiencies and would lead to revocation of carrier authority 
in october  the fmcsa completed a review of our operations and safety management controls 
upon completion of the review process  the fmcsa assigned to us a safety fitness rating of satisfactory 
the satisfactory safety fitness rating resolved our litigation with the fmcsa over the agency s proposed conditional rating in our current litigation with the fmcsa over civil penalties assessed in connection with audits in and  in an aggregate amount of approximately  is not affected by the fmcsa s recent satisfactory determination 
we are also in litigation with the fmcsa over civil penalties assessed in connection with the audit in in an amount less than  accounting standards not yet adopted the financial accounting standards board has issued statements of financial accounting standard sfas and interpretations fin for which the required implementation dates have not yet become effective 
a new standard that will likely materially impact us is discussed below 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements upon a grant date fair value of an award as opposed to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 which we currently use 
the standard is effective for the us beginning january  on september   the compensation committee of our board of directors accelerated the vesting of all outstanding and unvested employee stock options  and we recorded a million non cash expense 
the vesting period for stock options held by the non employee members of the board of directors was not accelerated 
also  in connection with the acceleration of the stock options  the compensation committee of our board of directors began to modify the structure of its compensation program to reduce the number of stock options awarded in the future  to reduce the number of employees eligible for awards and to incorporate a restricted stock element that includes performance standard objectives 
we estimate compensation expense related to sfas r will be less than  in without consideration of future awards 
critical accounting policies claims accruals we are self insured for a portion of our liability  workers compensation  property damage  cargo damage and employee medical expense risk 
this self insurance results from buying insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
each reporting period we accrue the cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
actual settlement of the self insured claim liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  including evaluation of severity  legal cost and claims that have been incurred  but not reported 
if claims development factors that are developed based upon historical experience increased by  our claims accrual as of december  would potentially increase by million 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we have million of goodwill recorded as of december  we test the goodwill  which arose from acquisitions  for impairment annually at our year end 
our test of goodwill impairment requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  which includes several significant assumptions  including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if operating margins decreased by for any of the reporting units  we would not be required to recognize an impairment 
in addition  we have million of intangible assets  arising from customer relationships obtained through acquisitions and subsequent contracts  recorded as of december  we are amortizing these assets over years 
although we do not believe any event or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  we tested these intangible assets with finite lives to provide the following information 
significant assumptions  including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions were used to value these intangible assets 
we estimate the impact of an impairment due to the loss of one contract termination could range from million to million 
revenue recognition operating revenues and related direct costs are recognized as of the date the freight is picked up for shipment 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with method two under eitf we do not believe the financial results derived from the application of this method differ materially from the results that would be derived under method three revenue recognized upon delivery discussed within eitf due to our relatively short length of haul 

table of contents results of operations for  and summary the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of earnings data as a percentage of operating revenue for the years ended december operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits operating supplies and expenses fuel purchased transportation rental expense insurance and claims depreciation  amortization and impairments gain loss on equipment disposal communications and utilities operating taxes and licenses total operating expenses operating income net interest expense other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings in  our net earnings decreased slightly from million in to million in trucking revenue increased primarily as a result of increased revenue per mile and improved utilization of our fleet 
these operational improvements helped to offset the increased cost of insurance as well as pay increases provided to our drivers and owner operators 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million to help offset the rising cost of fuel as shown in our fuel expense and purchased transportation costs 
also in  we recorded a million expense to accelerate the vesting period of stock options in connection with accounting rule changes  a million expense to reduce the carrying value of certain trailers and real estate to the estimated fair value less cost to sell  a million gain from the sale of real estate and a million pre tax benefit to recognize the decrease in the market value of interest rate derivative agreements 
our diluted earnings per share increased in to from in as we experienced a lower average share count in due to the large share repurchases made late in in  our net earnings increased to million or over this increase was primarily the result of a increase in trucking revenue and a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue which helped us recover increasing fuel costs 
our results in include a million expense for the cost of our voluntary early retirement program  a million gain from the sale of real estate  and a million benefit to recognize the decrease in the market value of interest rate derivatives 
we expect our operations to continue to benefit from our focus on operational metrics including  increasing revenue per loaded mile  reducing deadhead  and increasing utilization measured as weekly loaded truck miles  resulting in higher revenue per tractor per week 

table of contents revenue we segregate our revenue into three types trucking revenue  other revenue  and fuel surcharge revenue 
a summary of our revenue generated by type for the past three years is as follows thousands trucking revenue fuel surcharge revenue other revenue total operating revenue trucking revenue trucking revenue is revenue from freight hauled by our fleet and accounts for the majority of our total revenue 
generally  our customers pay for our services based on the number of miles between pick up and delivery and other ancillary services we provide 
to improve our trucking revenue we can either increase the number of revenue generating miles our trucks are driven or increase the rate at which we are paid 
we use three primary indicators  based upon tractors available for dispatch  to monitor our performance 
first  we monitor utilization of our tractors in the form of miles per tractor per week 
in conjunction with miles per tractor per week  we measure the percentage of miles our tractors travel that do not generate revenue  known as deadhead 
our goal is to minimize the amount of deadhead driven to allow for more revenue generating miles 
we monitor deadhead miles on a daily basis 
finally  to analyze the rates our customers pay  we measure revenue per loaded mile on a daily basis 
loaded miles include only the miles driven when hauling freight 
to improve revenue per mile we evaluate the lanes in which we operate to ensure we are adequately compensated and negotiate higher rates per mile with our customers where appropriate 
these indicators for the past three years are as follows total miles per tractor per week loaded miles per tractor per week deadhead percentage revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge revenue in addition to the rate per mile  we are also compensated  in some instances  for accessorial charges such as detention and loading and unloading freight for our customers 
these accessorial charges are also included in trucking revenue 
in  trucking revenue increased million or compared to the increase in our revenue per loaded mile generated million or of the growth 
utilization improvements that enabled us to run more loaded miles with existing tractors contributed million or of the growth in trucking revenue 
the remaining increase was primarily the result of a slightly larger fleet in of  average tractors available for dispatch compared to  in trucking revenue grew million or approximately in compared to increases in our revenue per mile accounted for million or of the growth 
improvements in utilization contributed or million to growth 
the acquisition of merit distribution services  inc in july of accounted for approximately of growth  while the acquisition of trans mex in january of contributed an additional of growth 
the remaining increase was due to volume 
fuel surcharge revenue fuel surcharge revenue is generated based on increases in fuel costs billed to our customers 
although our surcharge programs vary by customer  prior to october we received approximately an additional penny per mile for every six cent increase in the department of energy s average diesel fuel index 
throughout the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  we renegotiated with many of our customers to increase the charge to one penny for every five cent increase in the diesel fuel index 
in some instances  customers chose to incorporate the change by splitting the impact between the basic rate per mile and the surcharge fee 
we believe this change in policy over time will cover the majority of our exposure to increases in the cost of fuel 
however  there can be no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely 
fuel surcharge revenue increased in in addition to growth in compared to the department of energy diesel fuel index increased to an average of in from in and in the increase in the average cost of fuel  as well as our increase in volume and our fuel surcharge program  directly contributed to the growth in fuel surcharge revenue 
other revenue other revenue is generated primarily by freight moved for our customers on rail or other purchased transportation 
in  we entered into an agreement with bnsf railway to assume the leases for certain foot intermodal containers 
we began receiving these containers in the third quarter of and by december  had received approximately containers 
we also purchased an additional  containers 
these containers will be used to serve customers that transport shipments over the rail network and use a truck to transport the container to and from the rail depots 
we expect we will have approximately  containers by the end of other revenue increased million in as compared to the increase was driven by revenue generated with the new intermodal containers partially offset by a decrease in other third party trucking revenue 
prior to  the revenue generated when subcontracting with trans mex  inc was included in other revenue 
in january  we acquired of trans mex and have fully consolidated its financial results in and other revenue decreased in because trans mex revenue was reclassified to trucking revenue 
trans mex accounted for million of other revenue in the remaining decline in other revenue in compared to was a reduction in the revenue received from freight moved by rail 
major customers sales to wal mart  our largest customer  generated approximately of our total revenue in and and of operating revenue in no other customer accounted for or more of our operating revenue in any reporting period 
revenue and expense comparisons when analyzing our expenses for growth related to volume  we believe using total revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue is a more applicable measure for all costs with the exception of fuel expense 
fuel surcharge revenue is primarily a function of the increases and or decreases in the cost of fuel and not specifically related to our non fuel operational expenses 
in addition  fuel surcharge revenue increased and in and  respectively  as a result of the significant increases in fuel costs 
our trucking and other revenue combined increased and  respectively  in and for these reasons  we analyze our expenses below using revenue excluding fuel surcharge  calculated as follows thousands total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
table of contents operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million in compared to included in salaries  wages and employee benefits is a million charge associated with the acceleration of the vesting of million stock options that was recorded in the third quarter of and a million expense recorded in the first quarter of associated with a voluntary early retirement plan 
excluding these charges from the respective years  salaries  wages and employee benefits was million in or of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue compared to million in or of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
total driver compensation was relatively flat on a per mile basis between and as increases in driver pay per mile were offset primarily by a decrease in workers compensation costs 
driver wages and benefits expense increased between and as our company miles increased  but decreased as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue as increases in revenue per mile exceeded increases in driver costs 
total driver compensation increased cents per mile in compared to as a result of the pay increases made to drivers and increased costs related to fringe benefits 
this increase includes a slight reduction in pay per mile resulting from the driver per diem program implemented in september and the consolidation of trans mex 
the per diem program consists of a decrease in the drivers pay per mile offset by a non taxable per diem payment for reimbursement of meals and expenses while on the road 
total driver compensation decreased as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue year over year despite the increase in pay per mile 
this is a function of our revenue per mile increasing more than our driver pay increases and our owner operators driving proportionately more miles in non driver salaries  wages and employee benefits increased approximately million between and excluding the charges described above 
this increase was the result of non driver merit pay increases and staffing increases primarily in safety  recruiting and terminal customer operations 
our non driver salaries  wages and benefits increased approximately million from to but decreased as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge 
our average number of non driver employees remained relatively flat from to  but increases in pay and a million expense for early retirement caused non driver salaries  wages and benefits to increase 
in  our deductible amount for workers compensation rose from  to  per incident and in rose to  we believe that the decrease in the cost of our premiums based on a  deductible will more than offset the cost of claims that occur within the  to  range  which historically have been a small number 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent we did not obtain corresponding rate increases 

table of contents operating supplies and expenses thousands operating supplies and expenses of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue operating supplies and expenses increased million or from of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue to between and in  we completed the amortization of million of legal fees related to a legal settlement discussed in the insurance and claims section below 
these fees were amortized over months on a straight line basis between july and december therefore  million was expensed in excluding this expense  operating supplies and expenses increased million between and driven by higher maintenance and recruiting expenses 
the increase in recruiting expenses is associated with the expansion of our driver academies and a increase in the number of graduates from our academies 
the increased maintenance expense is related to an increase in the equipment services we provide for owner operators and other third parties for which we receive revenue  as well as increases to trailer maintenance 
operating supplies and expenses in increased million compared to approximately million of the increase is due to the consolidation of trans mex 
other variances include a slight increase in maintenance  increased travel  additional legal costs and additional expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
fuel expense thousands fuel expense of total revenue company fuel cost per gallon fuel expense in increased to of total revenue in compared to in of the million increase  was the result of the increase in fuel cost per gallon 
the remaining increase resulted from higher mileage and reduced fuel efficiency 
fuel costs in increased million or compared to the majority of the increase is the result of our average fuel cost per gallon increasing over year over year 
approximately of the increase is due to the additional miles associated with our revenue increase and the remaining increase is due to a reduction in fuel efficiency resulting from a larger portion of our engines conforming to the new engines mandated by the us environmental protection agency that became effective october   and the higher driving speeds adopted in july of increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we believe that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
we do not use derivative type hedging products  but periodically evaluate their possible use 
to measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program  we subtract fuel surcharge revenue received for company miles driven as opposed to miles driven by our owner operators who pay for their own fuel from 
table of contents our fuel expense 
the result is evaluated as a percent of revenue less fuel surcharge revenue 
these measures are shown below thousands total fuel surcharge revenue less fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators company fuel surcharge revenue total fuel expense less company fuel surcharge revenue net fuel expense of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue our net fuel expense has remained relatively flat as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge for the past three years 
this indicates that our fuel surcharge program has effectively offset the impact of rising diesel fuel costs  and our net fuel expense increases are the result of volume 
the basis point decline between and was the result of the leverage associated with increases in our base revenue per loaded mile 
purchased transportation thousands total purchased transportation of total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators purchased transportation excluding fuel surcharge reimbursement of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue purchased transportation increased million from to  of which million was the increase in the reimbursement made to owner operators for fuel surcharges 
excluding this reimbursement  purchased transportation increased basis points from to to of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
the increase in purchase transportation dollars as well as the percent to revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue is primarily a result of the increase in rail costs due to the expansion of our intermodal container business  an increase in the miles driven by owner operators as well as an increase in owner operator pay per mile 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in other third party expenses 
purchased transportation increased million in compared to of which million was the increase in fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to our owner operators 
excluding fuel surcharge  purchased transportation increased year over year as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
in and prior  the cost of using trans mex was included in purchased transportation 
after completing the acquisition of trans mex in january  we began consolidating their financial statements  and their costs now are shown on each individual line item on the consolidated statement of earnings 
therefore  the purchased transportation line has been reduced by these trans mex costs 
this accounts for approximately a one percentage point reduction 
this reduction was offset by an increase in owner operator costs 
our owner operators drove approximately more miles for us in compared to in addition  they have received rate per mile increases  hours of service rate increases  and other incentive pay in order for us to attract and retain owner operators 

table of contents insurance and claims thousands insurance and claims of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue insurance and claims expense increased million in as compared to this increase is primarily related to the fact that we did not incur certain insurance premium expense in  the increase in our self insurance deductible in  and the development of prior year claims 
our reserve policy and accrual methodology have not changed year over year 
as we discussed in the notes to our financial statements  we entered into a settlement agreement with an insurance company in pursuant to this settlement  the insurance company agreed to provide certain insurance coverage  at no cost to us through december  in exchange for our releasing all claims that were the subject of the litigation 
we recognized this settlement amount as a reduction of insurance expense as the insurance coverage was provided during the period from july  through december  in addition  we deferred the million of legal expenses  which were paid pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement based upon our estimate of the value of the insurance provided of between million and million 
these legal expenses were contingent upon our ability to receive the insurance coverage outlined in the settlement due to the liquidation  rehabilitation  bankruptcy or other similar insolvency of the insurers and  therefore  were amortized on a straight line basis over the thirty month period from july  through december  as discussed under critical accounting policies  we are self insured for some portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
we buy insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
beginning in  the deductible amount for general liability rose from  to  per incident 
in december  we entered into an agreement with insurance carriers to provide transportation liability insurance with an aggregate limit of million for and the new policy increased the self insured portion to million per occurrence and was extended through the end of after reviewing actuarial studies of our loss history  frequency and severity  we determined this to be the optimal insurance solution for us at this time 
this expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
insurance and claims in was of revenue excluding fuel surcharge compared to in the reduction in was due to a reduction in development on prior year claims 
rental expense  depreciation  amortization and impairments thousands rental expense of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue depreciation  amortization and impairments of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue total rental  depreciation amortization and impairment expense of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
table of contents rental expense and depreciation expense are primarily driven by our fleet of tractors and trailers shown below thousands tractors company owned leased total company tractors owner operator tractors total tractors average tractors available for dispatch trailers total tractors owned and leased include tractors being prepared for service and tractors waiting to be returned under lease or resold at the end of our replacement program 
average tractors is calculated on a monthly basis and represents tractors available for dispatch 
over the past three years  we have been purchasing the majority of our tractors and trailers rather than leasing 
this has caused our rental expense to decrease and our depreciation expense to increase 
as a percentage of revenue excluding fuel surcharge  total rental  depreciation  amortization and impairment expense decreased to in compared to in both and in  rental expense decreased million as the number of leased tractors declined from  in to  in depreciation  amortization and impairment expense increased million in compared to included in this expense in is a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of some specialized trailers to their fair market value less costs to sell 
the charge was recorded in the third quarter of when the trailers were reclassified to assets held for sale 
this charge and the increase in the number of owned tractors resulted in the increased depreciation expense year over year 
rental expense decreased in compared to as the number of tractors on lease declined from  as of december  to  as of december  this reduction in tractor lease cost was partially offset by an increase in short term trailer rent expense 
depreciation  amortization and impairment expense increased in as compared to  as the number of tractors owned increased from  as of december  to  at december  depreciation expense in did include an impairment charge of million to adjust autohaul assets held for sale to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
as previously disclosed  in and we amended our replacement cycle for our tractors from three years to five years 
to implement these changes  the remaining net book value of the affected tractors at the time of change is being depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining adjusted economic life to the revised residual value

thousands interest expense decrease in derivative agreements interest expense  net of derivative agreements interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements shown above  increased million in compared to this increase is due to the higher average debt balance we experienced throughout the year as well as rising base interest rates on our variable debt 
our interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements  increased in our average debt balance increased during as we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cost of million  paid million in cash for part of the purchase price of trans mex  and expended million on net capital expenditures compared to million in in addition  in june  we completed the private placement of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of which was higher than the variable rate debt in other income expense other income expense in includes a million gain on the sale of real estate  a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of certain real estate and other assets to the estimated fair value less costs to sell  and a million loss associated with the equity losses of transplace 
in  other income expense includes a gain of million on the sale of real estate  a million loss to adjust the carrying value of four properties and a note receivable to the current estimate of the net realizable value  and a million loss for our equity portion of transplace s reported losses 
the equity earnings of trans mex  a company we acquired of in january  are included in other income expense in income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
in  we benefited from a lower state tax rate resulting from the completion and filing of our state tax returns  
table of contents including the adjustment of our deferred taxes to the revised rate

we expect our overall tax rate to be in liquidity and capital resources cash flow our cash flow sources and uses by operating  investing and financing activities are shown below thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was down million in compared to pre tax operating income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization and impairment charges increased approximately million in compared to the prior year 
income tax and interest payments increased million and million  respectively  between and the increase in tax payments was primarily related to the expiration of bonus depreciation for revenue equipment on december  our accounts receivable balance increased less between and compared to the increase between and  as our cash collection process improved and our day sales outstanding declined from in to in excluding the impact of the income tax receivable  our accounts receivable balance increased million in compared to a million increase between and excluding the change in income taxes payable  the increase in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities in was million compared to a million increase between and in  our prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million compared to a million increase between and this increase resulted primarily from the prepayment of insurance premiums 
the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was driven by a million increase in net earnings before depreciation  amortization and impairment charges and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our cash used in investing activities is mainly driven by our capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds 
our capital expenditures  net of cash sales proceeds were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a summary of our capital expenditures by category is shown below 
thousands revenue equipment tractors trailers facilities other total capital expenditures less proceeds from sales of equipment net capital expenditures in addition  we made a loan to transplace of million in  expended million for a portion of the trans mex purchase in  and paid million for the purchase of merit distribution  inc in 
table of contents regarding our financing activities  in we received million in proceeds from the sale of common stock associated with our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
the volume of sales increased in due to the decision made to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding and unvested employee stock options 
options that were previously awarded at a discount are now retroactively subject to new tax regulations regarding deferred compensation which impose a excise tax to income created by the exercise of these options after december  due to this change in tax law  many employees exercised their options prior to year end 
in conjunction with the acceleration  we have adopted a new share repurchase program  under which we may acquire our common stock using the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to minimize the dilution from the exercise of stock options 
in  we paid million to repurchase  shares 
in we repurchased million of treasury stock  increased our borrowings on our receivable securitization by million and increased our borrowings on our revolving line of credit by a net million 
we also repaid million of other long term debt and capital leases and received million in stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds 
working capital as of december  and we had working capital deficits of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the accounts receivable securitization is reflected as a current liability because the committed term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the funds received under the accounts receivable securitization are generally used for capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock 
therefore  our working capital will be reduced by the amount of the proceeds received under the accounts receivable securitization but the increase in fixed assets or treasury stock is not included in working capital 
credit facilities in december  we amended our million revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with our group of lenders 
this amendment included a reduction of the borrowing rate associated with libor borrowings 
interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon one of two options  which we select at the time of borrowing the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins ranging from to basis points  as defined in the credit agreement currently basis points 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a commitment fee ranging from to basis points currently basis points 
the credit agreement requires us to meet certain covenants with respect to leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth 
as of december  we are in compliance with these debt covenants 
we have million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding on our line of credit leaving million available as of december  in december of we expanded our accounts receivable securitization by million to allow us to receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible trade accounts receivable 
under the amended agreement  the committed term was extended to december  as of december   we had received sales proceeds of million 
under the terms of our agreement  of our trade receivables collateralized the securitization arrangement as of december  capital commitments and expenditures as of december   we had million of commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment through we have the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
we anticipate spending approximately million for tractors in both and and approximately million and million on trailers and containers in and  respectively 
we believe we will be able to support these purchases with cash flows from operating activities  lease financings and debt 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities and equipment 
we anticipate 
table of contents that we will expend approximately million in for various facilities and information technology upgrades and the development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
we will incur capital investments for revenue equipment  as well as our terminal network facilities and equipment  when we estimate such investments will generate an appropriate return on capital 
we believe we will be able to finance needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet replacements and growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases for the next months 
over the long term  we will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require us to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and other factors over which we have little or no control 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the commitments note to our consolidated financial statements  we guarantee certain residual values under operating lease agreements for revenue equipment 
upon termination of these operating leases  we would be responsible for the excess of the guarantee amount above the fair market value  if any 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we would be required to make under these guarantees is million 
we utilize operating leases as an additional financing source 
contractual obligations the tables below summarize our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations fair value of interest rate swaps total contractual obligations operating leases include an interest element within the commitment amount as opposed to the long term debt and capital lease obligations amounts  which do not include an interest element

inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years with the exception of fuel 
our average fuel cost per gallon has increased from 
table of contents to and between and in  the majority of this increase in costs was passed on to our customers through a corresponding increase in fuel surcharge revenue  therefore the impact of the increased fuel costs on our operating results was not significant 
if fuel costs continue to escalate and we are unable to recover these costs with applicable fuel surcharges  it would have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern 
as customers ramp up for the holiday season at year end  the late third and fourth quarters have historically been our strongest volume quarters 
as customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season  the first quarter has historically been a lower volume quarter 
our operating expenses also tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time
