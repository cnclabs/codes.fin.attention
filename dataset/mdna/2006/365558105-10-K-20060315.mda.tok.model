gardner denver has an active environmental management program aimed at compliance with existing environmental regulations and developing methods to eliminate or significantly reduce the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  gardner denver was only a small contributor to the substantial majority of these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense

item a 
risk factors the company may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and fully realize the related anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements 
including the purchase of the todo group  completed in january  the company has completed acquisitions since becoming an independent company in  with the three largest transactions occurring since january the continued success of the company depends in part on its ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into its operations 
the company faces significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process can be complex and time consuming  may be disruptive to the company s existing and acquired businesses  and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  those businesses 
even if the company can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into its operations  there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame  or at all 
the company s ability to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors  including the following the company s ability to effectively eliminate redundant administrative overhead and rationalize manufacturing capacity is difficult to predict 
accordingly  the actual amount and timing of the resulting cost savings are inherently difficult to predict 
the company may incur significant cash integration costs in achieving cost savings  and any cost savings or other synergies from acquisitions may be offset by such integration costs 
the cost savings and other synergies realized from acquisitions may be offset by increases in other expenses  by operating losses  or by problems unrelated to any specific acquisition 
the company has exposure to economic downturns and operates in cyclical markets 
as a supplier of capital equipment to a variety of industries  the company is adversely affected by general economic downturns 
demand for compressor and vacuum products is dependent upon capital spending by manufacturing and process industries 
many of the company s customers  particularly industrial customers  will delay capital projects  including non critical maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
demand for certain of the company s fluid transfer products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices 
the energy market  in particular  is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed  the demand for the company s products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced 
accordingly  the company s operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
the markets for the company s products have historically experienced downturns in demand 
future downturns could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and the company s dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s primary raw materials are cast iron  aluminum and steel 
while the company is seeking to enter into long term contracts with the its suppliers  most of its suppliers are not currently parties to long term contracts 
consequently  the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials 
the company uses single sources of supply for certain iron castings and other select engineered components 
from time to time in recent years  the company has experienced a disruption to its supply deliveries and it may experience further supply disruptions 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its commitments to customers and  therefore  its operating results 
the company faces robust competition in the markets it serves  which could materially and adversely affect its operating results 
the company actively competes with companies producing the same or similar products 
depending on the particular product  the company experiences competition based on a number of factors  including quality  performance  price and availability 
the company competes against many companies  including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than the company 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which the company competes and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter the company s markets 
in particular  it is possible that the company s european and asian based competitors could seek to establish a greater presence in the united states market 
if the company cannot compete successfully  its sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the company s business 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states 
the company has manufacturing facilities in germany  the united kingdom  china  finland  brazil and canada 
the company anticipates that it may continue to expand its international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
non us operations and non us export sales could be adversely affected as a result of nationalization of private enterprises  political or economic instability in certain countries  differences in foreign laws  including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights  changes in the legal and regulatory policies of foreign jurisdictions  credit risks  currency fluctuations  exchange controls  changes in tariff restrictions  royalty and tax increases  export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials  shipping products during times of crisis or war  and other factors inherent in foreign operations 
the company s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its financial health 
the company substantially increased its indebtedness in order to finance the acquisitions consummated in and  and the high level of indebtedness could have an adverse future effect on its business 
for example the company may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of its growth strategy  or other purposes  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on its debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  the company may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  the various covenants contained in the company s senior credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  and the documents governing its other existing indebtedness may place it at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to some of its competitors  and borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
if the company is in compliance with the covenants set forth in the documents governing its indebtedness  the company and or its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness 
if the company or any of its subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that they now face may intensify 
the company is a defendant in certain asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits  which could adversely affect its financial condition 
the company has been named as a defendant in an increasing number of asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources  and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not been physically impaired with a disease for which the company has responsibility 
the company believes that the pending lawsuits will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies  could cause a different outcome 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits  whether by judgment  settlement  or dismissal  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the nature of the company s products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims  which could harm its business 
customers use some of the company s products in potentially hazardous drilling  completion and production applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property  equipment or the environment 
in addition  the company s products are integral to the production process for some end users and any failure of the company s products could result in a suspension of their operations 
although the company maintains strict quality controls and procedures  it cannot be certain that the company s products will be completely free from defects 
the company maintains amounts and types of insurance coverage that it believes are adequate and consistent with normal industry practice 
however  the company cannot guarantee that insurance will be adequate to cover all liabilities incurred 
the company also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels it believes are necessary and at rates it considers reasonable 
the company may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where its equipment and services have been used 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the company s operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
under such laws and regulations  the company can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
the company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and regulations 
the company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its manufacturing operations 
in addition  many of its current and former properties are  or have been  used for industrial purposes 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws 
an accrued liability on its balance sheet reflects costs which are probable and estimable for its projected financial obligations relating to these matters 
if the company has underestimated its remaining financial obligations  it may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters  and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require the company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s success depends on its executive officers and other key personnel 
the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of its executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers  particularly its chairman  president and chief executive officer  ross j 
centanni  could have an adverse impact 
none of the company s executive officers has an employment agreement 
however  the company has a common stock ownership requirement and provides certain benefits for its executive officers  including change in control agreements  which provide incentives for them to make a long term commitment to the company 
the company s future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on its operations 
the company s business could suffer if it experiences employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties 
as of january  the company has approximately  full time employees 
a significant number of the company s employees  including a large portion of the employees outside of the united states  are represented by labor unions 
although the company does not anticipate future work stoppages by its union employees  there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur 
although the company believes that its relations with employees are good and has not experienced any recent strikes or work stoppages  it cannot be assured that it will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of the company s operations 
the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair the company s ability to manufacture its products and result in increased costs and or decreased operating results 
the company may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for it to realize its growth strategy 
one of the company s growth strategies is to increase its sales and expand its markets through acquisitions 
it expects to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  the company s acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of the company s existing operations 
third parties may infringe upon the company s intellectual property and the company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury 
the company s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
the company may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights 
if the company fails to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights  the company s competitive position could suffer  which could harm its operating results 
the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity 
these assumptions include discount rate  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or future changes in assumptions may affect the company s obligations  future expense and funding requirements 
a significant portion of the company s assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of which may be reduced if the company determines that those assets are impaired 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or of the company s total assets 
goodwill is generated in an acquisition when the cost of such acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is no longer amortized under generally accepted accounting principles as a result of sfas no 
instead  goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment analyses at least annually 
the company could be required to recognize reductions in its net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  which  if significant  could materially and adversely affect its results of operations

management s discussion and analysis the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview and description of business the company believes it is one of the leading designers  manufacturers and marketers of engineered stationary air compressors  liquid ring pumps and blowers for various industrial and transportation applications and of pumps used in the petroleum and industrial markets and other fluid transfer equipment serving chemical  petroleum and food industries 
since its spin off from cooper industries  inc in  the company has completed acquisitions  including the purchase of the todo group  completed in january  growing its revenues from approximately million in to  million in of the acquisitions  the three largest  including the purchases of thomas industries inc thomas  nash elmo holdings  llc nash elmo and syltone plc syltone  were completed since january  on january   the company acquired syltone  previously a publicly traded company listed on the london stock exchange 
syltone  previously headquartered in bradford  england  is one of the world s largest manufacturers of equipment used for loading and unloading liquid and dry bulk products on commercial transportation vehicles 
this equipment includes compressors  blowers and other ancillary products that are complementary to the company s existing product lines 
syltone is also one of the world s largest manufacturers of fluid transfer equipment including loading arms  swivel joints  couplers and valves used to load and unload ships  tank trucks and rail cars 
syltone s largest markets are europe and north america 
on september   the company acquired nash elmo  a leading global manufacturer of industrial vacuum pumps 
nash elmo is primarily split between two businesses  liquid ring pumps and side channel blowers 
both businesses products are complementary to the compressor and vacuum products segment s product portfolio 
nash elmo  previously headquartered in trumbull  connecticut  has primary manufacturing facilities located in bad neustadt and nuremberg  germany  zibo  china  and campinas  brazil 
nash elmo s largest markets are in europe  asia  north america and south america 
on july   the company acquired thomas  previously a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange 
thomas  previously headquartered in louisville  kentucky  is a leading supplier of pumps  compressors and blowers to original equipment manufacturer oem applications such as medical equipment  gasoline vapor and refrigerant recovery  automotive and transportation applications  printing  packaging  tape drives and laboratory equipment 
thomas designs  manufactures  markets  sells and services these products through worldwide operations 
this acquisition is complementary to the company s compressor and vacuum products segment 
for the year ended december   thomas revenues and operating income were million and million  respectively 
operating income for this period included million from thomas interest in the genlyte thomas group llc  a joint venture formed with the genlyte group incorporated in  and a million one time gain on the sale of this joint venture in july as a result of the acquisition of thomas  certain changes were made to gardner denver s organizational structure 
the company s new organizational structure is still fundamentally based on the products and services the company offers 
in  thomas acquired werner rietschle holding gmbh rietschle  a privately held company based in germany 
prior to this acquisition  thomas was considered a leader in the production of oil free compressors  vacuum pumps and liquid pumps for oems 
rietschle products primarily include dry and oil lubricated vacuum pumps  compressors and blowers  which utilize similar technologies and serve similar markets as the company s blower division 
due to these distinct similarities  rietschle was combined with the company s blower division 
the original thomas business is now operated and managed as the company s thomas products division 
subsequent to the acquisition of thomas  gardner denver now has five operating divisions compressor  blower  liquid ring pump  fluid transfer and thomas products 
these divisions comprise two reportable segments compressor and vacuum products and fluid transfer products 
the compressor  blower  liquid ring pump and thomas products divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment compressor and vacuum products since the long term financial performance of these businesses is affected by similar economic conditions  coupled with the similar nature of their products  manufacturing processes and other business characteristics 
during the third quarter of  the company s former pump and fluid transfer divisions which consisted of the syltone fluid transfer related activities were combined into one division  fluid transfer 
these two divisions were previously aggregated into one reportable segment fluid transfer products primarily due to the same factors noted above  and thus  there has been no change to the fluid transfer products segment 
in the compressor and vacuum products segment  the company designs  manufactures  markets and services the following products and related aftermarket parts for industrial and commercial applications rotary screw  reciprocating  sliding vane and centrifugal compressors  positive displacement  centrifugal and side channel blowers  and liquid ring pumps and engineered systems 
with the acquisition of thomas  the product range now also includes single piece piston reciprocating  diaphragm  and linear compressor and vacuum pumps primarily serving oem applications 
stationary air compressors are used in manufacturing  process applications and materials handling  and to power air tools and equipment 
blowers are used primarily in pneumatic conveying  wastewater aeration  numerous applications in industrial manufacturing and engineered vacuum systems 
liquid ring pumps are used in many different vacuum applications and engineered systems  such as water removal  distilling  reacting  efficiency improvement  lifting and handling  and filtering  principally in the pulp and paper  industrial manufacturing  chemical and power industries 
revenues of the compressor and vacuum products segment constituted of total revenues in in the fluid transfer products segment  the company designs  manufactures  markets and services a diverse group of pumps  water jetting systems and related aftermarket parts used in oil and natural gas well drilling  servicing and production and in industrial cleaning and maintenance 
this segment also designs  manufactures  markets and services other fluid transfer components and equipment for the chemical  petroleum and food industries 
revenues of the fluid transfer products segment constituted of total revenues in the company sells its products through independent distributors and sales representatives  and directly to oems  engineering firms  packagers and end users 
the following table sets forth percentage relationships to revenues of certain income statement items for the years presented 
revenues costs and expenses cost of sales depreciation and amortization selling and administrative expenses interest expense other income  net total costs and expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income recent developments on january   the company completed the acquisition of the todo group todo  for a purchase price of million swedish kronor approximately million  net of debt and cash acquired 
todo  with assembly operations in sweden and the united kingdom  and a central european sales and distribution operation in the netherlands  has one of the most extensive offerings of dry break couplers in the industry 
todo matic self sealing couplings are used by many of the world s largest oil  chemical and gas companies to safely and efficiently transfer their products 
the todo acquisition extends the company s product line of emco wheaton couplers  added as part of the syltone acquisition in  and strengthens the distribution of each company s products throughout the world 
on february   the company s board of directors approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation  subject to stockholder approval  which would increase the number of shares of common stock that the company has authority to issue from  shares to  shares 
the board directed that the amendment be submitted for consideration and approval by the company s stockholders at the company s annual meeting of stockholders on may  on february   the board also approved a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend  subject to the approval of the amendment of the certificate of incorporation by the stockholders of the company 
in the event that stockholder approval of the proposed amendment is obtained  the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend is expected to become effective on or about june   with each stockholder of record at the close of business on the record date for the stock dividend  may   being entitled to receive one additional share of common stock for every share of common stock so held 
information concerning the stock split is available under proposal ii amendment of the company s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of the gardner denver proxy statement  dated march  year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to  million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of thomas  nash elmo and bottarini  which contributed approximately million of additional revenues 
increased volume of shipments  especially from petroleum related fluid transfer products such as drilling and well stimulation pumps  and price increases also contributed to the growth in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  mainly due to the strengthening of the u 
s dollar during against the british pound and the euro 
revenues outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to acquisitions and volume increases in europe  china and south africa 
revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in and  increased volume of compressor and blower shipments in the us  europe and china  and price increases  partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased to million in  compared to million in this improvement in revenues was driven by increased shipments in all product lines  but in particular drilling and well stimulation pumps and water jetting systems  which contributed of the growth in revenues  with the remaining due to price increases 
costs and expenses gross margin increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in incremental volume in both segments and the related benefit of increased fixed and semi fixed cost leverage over a higher revenue base  and favorable sales mix resulted in improved gross margin percentage of in  compared to in acquisitions net of cost reductions realized also positively impacted the gross margin percentage  as their gross margin percentage for the year was higher than the company s previously existing businesses 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material costs due to surcharges stemming from increases in scrap iron and other metal prices  and some supply chain inefficiencies that affected material availability 
the gross margin for and was also negatively affected by the inclusion of million and million  respectively  of inventory step up adjustments relating to recording the inventory of acquired businesses at fair value on the acquisition date 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  compared to million in  primarily due to the thomas and nash elmo acquisitions 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the majority of the increase was due to the acquisitions of thomas  nash elmo and bottarini  which contributed approximately million of additional selling and administrative expenses compared to higher compensation and fringe benefit costs also contributed to this increase 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to for the twelve month period of from in  due to the leverage of incremental revenue volume and the completion of various integration activities and cost reductions 
the compressor and vacuum products segment generated operating margin of in  compared to in contributions from acquisitions net of cost reductions realized with operating margins higher than the company s previously existing businesses  cost reductions and favorable sales mix accounted for the majority of the increase 
these positive factors were partially offset by increased material costs and compensation related expenses 
for reconciliation  refer to note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fluid transfer products segment generated operating margin of in  compared to in this improvement was primarily attributable to the positive effect of increased cost leverage over a higher revenue base and price increases 
capital investments to improve productivity and production efficiency combined with favorable product mix associated with a higher proportion of drilling pump shipments in as compared to  also contributed to the improvement in operating margin 
for reconciliation  refer to note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased million to million in  compared to this increase was primarily due to additional funds borrowed to finance the acquisition of thomas and higher average interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  was during  compared to during the higher weighted average interest rate in was primarily attributable to increases in market rates on floating rate debt and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in the second quarter of see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income  net increased million in to million  compared to the previous year 
this change was primarily due to litigation related settlements  a gain from the sale of a distribution facility and interest income earned on the investment of financing proceeds prior to their use to complete the acquisition of thomas 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in  as a result of incremental income before taxes and a slightly higher effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in the higher tax rate is principally due to a nonrecurring favorable tax audit settlement in of million 
the tax rate in also was slightly higher as a result of accruing an additional million of tax related to the repatriation of certain non us earnings in at a reduced income tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act of this slight increase was largely offset by deriving a higher proportion of earnings in from lower taxed non us jurisdictions 
consolidated net income for totaled million  which represents an increase of million  or  compared to net income of million in diluted earnings per share were in  which represents a increase compared to diluted earnings per share of earned in the results for include incremental net income of approximately million from the acquisition of nash elmo  compared to the previous year  and million from the acquisition of thomas 
the increase in net income was partially offset by higher average shares outstanding for the twelve month period of  as compared to  as a result of the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in may year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions in  which contributed million in revenues 
increased shipments of well stimulation pumps  pump parts  compressors and blowers  combined with changes in currency exchange rates and price increases  also contributed to this increase 
revenues outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to acquisitions and volume increases in europe  china and south africa 
revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to acquisitions in  increased volume of compressor and blower shipments in the us  europe  china and south africa  changes in currency exchange rates and price increases 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions  increased shipments of well stimulation pumps  water jetting systems and related aftermarket and price increases 
these positive factors were partially offset by a decreased volume of drilling pump shipments 
costs and expenses gross margin increased million to million in  compared to million in gross margin percentage increased to in  compared to in this increase in gross margin percentage was principally attributable to the increased volume in both segments and the related positive impact of increased leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
acquisitions completed in also positively impacted gross margin percentage  as their gross margin percentage was higher than the company s previously existing businesses despite a non recurring negative impact of approximately million stemming from recording their inventory at fair value on the respective acquisition dates 
finally  favorable sales mix also contributed to the increased gross margin as included a higher percentage of aftermarket sales compared to the prior year 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material costs due to surcharges on castings and other components stemming from increases in scrap iron and other metal prices 
higher warranty costs and some supply chain inefficiencies that affected material availability also negatively impacted gross margin 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the syltone and nash elmo acquisitions 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to acquisitions in million 
higher compensation and fringe benefit costs  professional fees and changes in currency exchange rates also contributed to this increase 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses increased to for from in the prior year  primarily due to the acquisitions 
other income  net decreased million in to million  compared to million in this change was primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction gains recorded in prior year results included a million gain in the fourth quarter related to the appreciation of us dollar borrowings  which were converted to british pounds prior to being used to consummate the syltone acquisition 
an additional million gain was recorded related to these borrowings in the first quarter of prior year results also included a million gain on the sale of an idle manufacturing facility in syracuse  new york 
the compressor and vacuum products segment generated operating margin of in  compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base  favorable sales mix and restructuring programs initiated in the fourth quarter of these positive factors were partially offset by higher material  compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs 
for reconciliation  refer to note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fluid transfer products segment generated operating margin of in  compared to in this improvement was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base  operational improvements and price increases 
these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of the syltone business included in this segment which had lower operating earnings as a percentage of revenues than the segment s previously existing businesses 
operating earnings as a percentage of revenues from fluid transfer products segment businesses that existed prior to the syltone acquisition were in for reconciliation  refer to note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased million to million in  compared to million in  due to higher average borrowings stemming from the syltone and nash elmo acquisitions and higher average interest rates 
the average interest rate was in  compared to in refer to note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s borrowing arrangements 
income before income taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in acquisitions in contributed million to this increase 
the balance of the increase was primarily due to the increased volume in both segments and the related positive impact of increased leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material  compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in  as a result of the incremental income before taxes  partially offset by a lower overall effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was lowered to in compared to in the lower rate is principally due to favorable tax audit settlements in finland and the u 
s of million and million  respectively 
a higher proportion of earnings derived from lower taxed non us jurisdictions also contributed to the lower effective tax rate 
these positive factors were partially offset by incremental taxes accrued in the amount of million for the planned repatriation of certain non us earnings in at a reduced income tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act of net income increased million to million diluted earnings per share in  compared to million diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income is primarily attributable to the same factors that resulted in increased income before taxes and the lower effective tax rate as noted above 
changes in currency exchange rates also contributed favorably by increasing net income by approximately million 
net income included million diluted earnings per share and million diluted earnings per share in after tax lifo income in and  respectively 
the estimated incremental impact on diluted earnings per share from acquisitions was in  which was partially offset by a dilutive impact from a stock offering completed in the first quarter of outlook in  orders for compressor and vacuum products were  million  compared to million in order backlog for the compressor and vacuum products segment was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the incremental impact from acquisitions completed during and for this segment was approximately million and million for orders and backlog  respectively  for the year ended and as of december  excluding the impact of acquisitions  the increase in orders and backlog compared to the prior year was primarily due to modest improvement in industrial demand in the us and eastern europe  pricing and incremental market share gains in europe and china  partially offset by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates 
the company also experienced an increase in demand for positive displacement blowers used in transportation applications in the us in general  demand for compressor and vacuum products correlates to the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial equipment production because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process 
over longer time periods  demand also follows the economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product around the world 
these indicators  while being relatively weak in recent years  began to gradually improve in the us toward the end of and during total industry capacity utilization in the us exceeded the key threshold level of for two consecutive months in the fourth quarter of as a result  the company anticipates continued gradual expansion in industrial demand in  particularly in the asian and north american markets  and corresponding positive improvement in demand for compressor and vacuum products 
demand for petroleum related fluid transfer products has historically corresponded to market conditions and expectations for oil and natural gas prices 
orders for fluid transfer products increased million  or  to million in compared to order backlog for the fluid transfer products segment was million at december   compared to million at december   representing a increase 
the significant increases in orders and backlog were primarily due to strong demand for drilling pumps  well stimulation pumps and petroleum pump parts  as a result of continued high prices for oil and natural gas  and price increases 
future increases in demand for these products will likely be dependent upon rig counts and oil and natural gas prices  which the company cannot predict 
based on growth expectations for the oil and gas industry  the company expects demand for petroleum related fluid transfer products to remain strong during and into in response to current and expected future demand for fluid transfer products  the company has made capital investments to improve production efficiency and outsourced certain machining operations to reduce the potential for manufacturing bottlenecks 
liquidity and capital resources operating working capital during  operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories  less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the acquisitions of thomas and bottarini during the year 
inventory turnover was at both december  and days sales outstanding improved to days at december   compared to days at december   due to improved collections 
cash flows during  the company generated cash flows from operations totaling million  an increase of million compared to this increase was primarily the result of acquisitions and higher net income from previously existing businesses  coupled with a continued focus on working capital management as evidenced by the improvement in days sales outstanding and inventory turnover ratios 
net of cash acquired  million was used to fund the thomas and bottarini acquisitions including direct acquisition costs in this use of cash was funded by long term borrowings see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and million in net proceeds from the company s issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in may fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in  compared to an increase of million in the decrease was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar during against the british pound and the euro 
during the fourth quarter of  the company repatriated approximately million of net cash from its foreign subsidiaries and used the proceeds to repay debt 
capital expenditures and commitments capital projects designed to increase operating efficiency and flexibility  expand production capacity and increase product quality resulted in expenditures of million in  compared to million in the higher spending in reflects a full year of investments in nash elmo and six months of capital spending on thomas operations 
commitments for capital expenditures at december  were approximately million 
the company currently expects capital spending to be approximately million to million in  and will be used primarily to integrate businesses  introduce new products and improve operations 
capital expenditures related to environmental projects have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
in october  gardner denver s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock to be used for general corporate purposes  of which  shares remain available for repurchase under this program as of december  in october  the company established a stock repurchase program for its executive officers to provide a means for them to sell gardner denver common stock and obtain sufficient funds to meet income tax obligations which arise from the exercise or vesting of incentive stock options  restricted stock or performance shares 
the gardner denver board has authorized up to  shares for repurchase under this program  and of this amount   shares remain available for repurchase as of december  between october and december   a total of  shares have been repurchased at a cost of million under both repurchase programs 
liquidity on july   the company s million amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement became effective in connection with the thomas acquisition 
the credit agreement provided the company with access to senior secured credit facilities  including a million term loan  and restated its million revolving line of credit  superceding the company s previously existing credit agreement 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to fund the thomas acquisition and retire million of debt outstanding under the previously existing term loan 
the new term loan has a final maturity of july  the company made a principal payment of million on the term loan in december  which was funded in part by the million in net cash repatriated from foreign subsidiaries 
the remaining million was funded by borrowings on the revolving line of credit by foreign subsidiaries and by cash flows from operations 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments aggregating million  million  million  million and million in through  respectively 
the revolving line of credit matures on september  loans under this facility may be denominated in us dollars or several foreign currencies and may be borrowed by the company or two of its foreign subsidiaries as outlined in the credit agreement 
on december   the revolving line of credit had an outstanding principal balance of million  leaving million available for letters of credit or for future use  subject to the terms of the revolving line of credit 
the interest rates applicable to loans under the credit agreement are variable and will be  at the company s option  either the prime rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin percentages are adjustable quarterly  based upon financial ratio guidelines defined in the credit agreement 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future libor based interest payments on its variable rate debt see note off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries  and are secured by a pledge of certain subsidiaries capital stock 
the company is subject to customary covenants regarding certain earnings  liquidity and capital ratios 
pursuant to its previously filed shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  the company completed an offering of  shares of its common stock including shares purchased by underwriters to cover over allotments for proceeds of approximately million net of direct costs associated with the offering during may in may  the company also completed an offering of million of its senior subordinated notes in a private placement the private notes 
the company used the proceeds from the private notes  proceeds from the issuance of common stock and funds available under the credit agreement to finance its acquisition of thomas in july and to repay certain indebtedness 
in an exchange offer completed in november  all of the private notes were exchanged for notes with identical terms that are registered under the securities act of the notes 
the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and are guaranteed by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
at any time prior to may   the company may redeem all or part of the notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus an applicable premium in the range of to of the principal amount  and accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
in addition  at any time prior to may   the company may  on one or more occasions  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings  subject to certain conditions 
on or after may   the company may redeem all or a part of the notes at varying redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture  the company is required to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding for cash at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
the indenture contains events of default and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for such financings  including  among other things  limits on incurring additional debt and restricted payments 
management currently expects the company s future cash flows to be sufficient to fund its scheduled debt service and provide required resources for working capital and capital investments for at least the next twelve months 
the company was in compliance  in all material respects  with all covenants related to its credit facilities during contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in thousand less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated as of december  for this reason  these numbers will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows 
the above table excludes million of other non current liabilities recorded in the balance sheet  which primarily consist of pension and other postretirement liabilities and deferred income taxes  because the timing of payments related to such liabilities is uncertain 
the table also excludes interest payments on existing debt arrangements 
for further information regarding the company s debt arrangements and related interest rates  refer to note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the company or its subsidiaries may sometimes be required to provide surety bonds  standby letters of credit or similar instruments to guarantee its performance of contractual or legal obligations 
as of december   the company had million in such instruments outstanding and had pledged million of cash to the issuing financial institutions as collateral for such instruments 
contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  among other things  the company has been named as a defendant in an increasing number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in an increasing number of silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience  the vast majority of the plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease for which the company bears any responsibility 
predecessors to the company sometimes manufactured  distributed and or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits the products 
however  neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand  the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits 
moreover  the asbestos containing components of the products were enclosed within the subject products 
the company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis lawsuits 
the company also believes some of the potential liabilities regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other parties 
the company s uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have been immaterial 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis lawsuits will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the components described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which the company otherwise bears responsibility  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies  could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits  whether by judgment  settlement or dismissal  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has also been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for environmental cleanup under various state and federal laws 
the company does not believe that the future potential costs related to these sites will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment to arb no 
 chapter this statement amends previous guidance and requires expensing for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after june  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the initial implementation had no effect on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be expensed based on their fair values 
on april   the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a rule that delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r  which required adoption no later than july  the sec rule allows companies to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june  the new sec rule does not change the accounting required by sfas no 
r 
gardner denver adopted the provisions of fas no 
r effective january   using the modified prospective method  which requires the recognition of compensation costs beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
through the year ended december   gardner denver accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method in sfas no 
r will have an impact on gardner denver s results of operations  although it will have no impact on gardner denver s overall financial position 
management expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r will decrease net income for by approximately million to million 
a disproportionate amount of this expense will be recognized in the first quarter of  due to the number of options held by employees eligible for retirement 
the company s estimate is based on the assumption that the value of the stock option grant recurs in gardner denver s stock option grants contain a provision that accelerates vesting of options for holders that retire and have met retirement eligibility requirements 
currently  as part of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
 gardner denver records a pro forma expense for the unrecognized compensation cost in the period that the accelerated vesting occurs 
however  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  gardner denver will recognize compensation expense based on retirement eligibility dates for all options which contain an accelerated vesting provision 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in march  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to assist preparers with the implementation of sfas no 
r 
sab recognizes that considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement sfas no 
r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and that reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
gardner denver will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with its adoption of sfas no 
r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas no 
 which requires retrospective application for reporting a voluntary change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and also addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the initial implementation had no effect on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
inventories inventories  which consist of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis with the remaining million accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
management regularly reviews inventory for obsolescence to determine whether a write down is necessary 
various factors are considered in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
goodwill and other intangibles intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values  and when appropriate  the carrying value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value 
the company estimates fair value using available information regarding expected future cash flows and a discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital specific to the company 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test and determined that no impairment existed 
while management believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as product volumes  selling price changes  labor and material cost changes  productivity  interest rates and foreign exchange rates could affect such valuations 
pension and other postretirement benefits gardner denver offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees 
the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
these assumptions include the discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation  future rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
the discount rate used to determine pension obligations was selected by examining the rates of high quality  fixed income securities whose cash flows or duration match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments under a plan 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost 
the fair value of the plan assets of certain of the company s defined benefit pension plans was less than their accumulated benefit obligation at december  as a result  the company has recorded a cumulative reduction to stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of million after tax as of december  this non cash reduction in stockholders equity did not impact the company s compliance with its existing debt covenants and could be adjusted in future periods as a result a combination of factors  including interest rate changes  differences between actual and expected investment results  and contributions 
please refer to note pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to gardner denver s benefit plans  including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations 
income taxes the calculation of gardner denver s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgements 
as part of the company s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors us and international tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgements utilized in determining the income tax provision  and records adjustments as necessary 
contingencies contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgement both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the potential loss 
the most significant contingencies impacting the company s financial statements are those related to product warranty  personal injury lawsuits  environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for additional information on these matters  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements all of the statements in this annual report on form k  other than historical facts  are forward looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor of the private securities litigation reform act of  including  without limitation  the statements made in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  particularly under the caption outlook 
as a general matter  forward looking statements are those focused upon anticipated events or trends  expectations  and beliefs relating to matters that are not historical in nature 
such forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and business environment  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
these uncertainties and factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by such forward looking statements 
see also item a 
risk factors 
the following uncertainties and factors  among others  could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by forward looking statements the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions and realize anticipated cost savings  synergies and revenue enhancements  the risk that the company may incur significant cash integration costs to achieve any such cost savings  the company s exposure to economic downturns and market cycles  particularly the level of oil and natural gas prices and oil and gas drilling and production  which affect demand for the company s petroleum products  and industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization rates  which affect demand for the company s compressor and vacuum products  the risks of large or rapid increases in raw material costs or substantial decreases in their availability  and the company s dependence on particular suppliers  particularly iron casting and other metal suppliers  the risks associated with intense competition in the company s markets  particularly the pricing of the company s products  the company s ability to continue to identify and complete other strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate such acquisitions to achieve desired financial benefits  the risks associated with the reduced liquidity generated by the substantial additional indebtedness incurred to complete the thomas acquisition  including reduced liquidity for working capital and other purposes  increased vulnerability to general economic conditions and floating interest rates  and reduced financial and operating flexibility due to increased covenant and other restrictions in the company s credit facilities and indentures  economic  political and other risks associated with the company s international sales and operations  including changes in currency exchange rates primarily between the us dollar  the euro  the british pound and the chinese yuan  the risks associated with pending asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits  as well as other potential product liability and warranty claims due to the nature of the company s products  the risks associated with environmental compliance costs and liabilities  the ability to attract and retain quality management personnel  the ability to avoid employee work stoppages and other labor difficulties  the risks associated with defending against potential intellectual property claims and enforcing intellectual property rights  market performance of pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used for actuarial assumptions in pension and other postretirement obligation and expense calculations  the risk of possible future charges if the company determines that the value of goodwill or other intangible assets has been impaired  and changes in laws and regulations  including accounting standards  tax requirements and related interpretations or guidance 
the company does not undertake  and hereby disclaims  any duty to update these forward looking statements  although its situation and circumstances may change in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  as well as european and other foreign currency exchange rates  and selectively uses derivative financial instruments  including forwards and swaps  to manage these risks 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the value of market risk sensitive derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate these impacts 
as a result of recent acquisitions  a significant amount of the company s net income is earned in foreign currencies 
therefore  a strengthening in the us dollar across relevant foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound and chinese yuan  would have a corresponding negative impact on the company s future earnings 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for each derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item 
for each derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in earnings 
currency fluctuations on non us dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges on the company s investment in a foreign subsidiary are included in other comprehensive income 
to effectively manage interest costs  the company uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt 
including the impact of interest rate swaps outstanding  the interest rates on approximately of the company s total borrowings were effectively fixed as of december  also as part of its hedging strategy  the company periodically uses purchased option and forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions  future cash flows and firm commitments 
these contracts for the sale or purchase of currencies generally mature within one year 
notional transaction amounts and fair values for the company s outstanding derivatives  by risk category and instrument type  as of december  and  are summarized in note  off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements
