item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a branded food company specializing in processing  marketing and distributing culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts and snack products 
our company was founded in and has a strong heritage in the walnut market under the diamond of california brand 
on july  we converted from an agricultural cooperative association to a delaware corporation and completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
as a public company  our focus will be on building stockholder value 
we intend to expand our existing business  and to continue to introduce higher value branded products in our culinary and snack businesses  including snack products marketed under our emerald and harmony brand names 
our products are sold in over  retail locations in the united states and in over countries 
we sell products to approximately customers  including over international customers 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly large  national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors who serve independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we also sell our products to mass merchandisers  club stores  convenience stores  and through other retail channels 
our business is seasonal 
demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent  culinary nuts  is highest during the months of october  november and december 
we receive our principal raw material  walnuts  during the period from september to november and process it throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last quarter of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at our facilities  which routinely operate at capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
a disproportionate amount of our net sales and related net income net proceeds prior to the fiscal year ended july  are recognized in the first half of our fiscal year 
for example  net sales in the first half of and were and of net sales for each full fiscal year 
in the near term  we expect a higher percentage of our net income to be earned in the first half of our fiscal year because many of our operating costs are fixed and cannot be reduced when net sales are lower quarter to quarter 
however  as we continue to introduce new products  such as snack products  we expect net sales  and related net income  to be less seasonal 
the historical financial information contained herein for fiscal years prior to have been derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap for agricultural cooperative associations 
effective august   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap for companies that are not cooperative associations 
the principal difference relates to accounting for walnut inventories 
as an agricultural cooperative association  crop year pools were established for members walnuts 
in addition  net patronage proceeds or losses from the sale of walnuts were allocated to members by crop year pool 
payments to members were specifically identified as to crop year pool 

table of contents furthermore  as an agricultural cooperative association we used the net realizable value  or nrv  method to value walnut inventories delivered by members 
nrv is the estimated sales price of inventories less estimated completion  distribution and selling costs 
as a result of crop pool accounting and the nrv method of valuing inventories  our financial statements prior to august  do not include a cost of goods sold for walnuts received from members 
effective august   we were not eligible to use crop year pool accounting and nrv  therefore  we now account for purchases of walnuts from growers on a lower of cost or market basis 
consequently  the results of operations reported subsequent to fiscal year will be significantly different than net proceeds reported in fiscal year and prior 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when a persuasive arrangement exists  title has transferred based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
customers have the right to return certain products 
these product returns are estimated based upon historical results and reflected as a reduction in net sales 
inventories 
effective august   all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or market basis 
prior to that date  as a cooperative association  we recorded walnut inventories acquired from members at estimated net realizable value estimated sales price less estimated completion  distribution and selling costs 
we estimated sales prices and costs based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believed were reasonable 
actual results could have differed materially from these estimates 
all other inventories were stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in connection with our july initial public offering  we entered into long term walnut purchase agreements with substantially all of our former member growers 
under these agreements  growers will deliver their entire walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season and we will announce a purchase price for this inventory by march of the following year 
this purchase price will be a market based price determined by diamond in good faith  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality  and varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate price to be paid will be determined each march subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  management must make an estimate of this price for the first and second quarter interim financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change and such changes  if any  could be material 
we determined the purchase price for the crop in march this determination had no material impact on previously reported quarterly results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
prior to the acquisition of certain net assets of harmony foods corporation on may   we had no recorded goodwill 
since goodwill associated with harmony was not recognized until the fourth quarter of  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill since the acquisition 
in the future  we will perform the 
table of contents annual impairment test required by sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of each year 
we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
we utilize a third party actuarial firm to assist us in determining appropriate assumptions and plan valuations 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
accounting for stock based compensation 
beginning in fiscal year  we began accounting for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is established by determining the fair value of the option on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
we also account for restricted stock grants under sfas no 
r 
supplemental and non gaap financial information the following supplemental and non gaap financial information excludes a one time charge to cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the conversion from a cooperative to a public company in july this charge relates to the use of net realizable value nrv accounting for certain inventories acquired prior to august  starting august  we began using the lower of cost or market method of valuing walnut inventories acquired subsequent to that date 
as a result of using nrv accounting for certain inventories through july   these inventories were valued higher than they would have been under the lower of cost or market method 
therefore  as those inventories were sold  the amount charged to cost of goods sold was higher 
beginning august   our cost basis for walnuts is the price we pay for them 
for the years ended july  and  estimated walnut acquisition costs  is presented on a supplemental basis for purposes of comparability of our financial results to the year ended july  estimated walnut acquisition costs are based on the field price reported by the california statistical office of the usda national agricultural statistics service  or cass  for each related crop year 
we believe this information is the only available measure of industry wide walnut acquisition costs 
we cannot determine an actual cost basis for walnuts acquired and sold in historical periods 
in addition  we are unable to determine retroactively what we would have paid for walnuts in prior years had we not been a cooperative  are unable to determine whether what we would have paid for walnuts would approximate amounts paid to other growers by other processors as reflected in the cass statistics  are limited by the level of detail provided by the cass statistics  and cannot ensure that the cost of sales amounts implied by the cass statistics are representative of future cost of sales amounts 
we have not undertaken any effort to validate the accuracy of the cass statistics 

table of contents the non gaap financial information for also excludes the effects of stock based compensation and other operating expenses 
year ended july  unaudited in thousands net sales and other revenue cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative advertising total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net other expenses income loss before income tax expense benefit 
table of contents a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap and supplemental information in thousands is as follows gaap cost of sales adjustment to remove one time impact of accounting for certain inventories on nrv basis adjustment to convert walnut inventories from crop year pool and nrv accounting to cost basis accounting and to record estimated walnut cost of goods sold non gaap supplemental cost of sales gaap selling  general and administrative expense adjustment for stock based compensation non gaap selling  general and administrative expense gaap other operating expenses adjustment to remove restructuring  contract termination costs and expenses related to income tax credit non gaap other operating expenses gaap income loss before income tax expense benefit adjustment for stock based compensation adjustment to remove one time impact of accounting for certain inventories on nrv basis adjustment to remove restructuring  contract termination costs and expenses related to income tax credit and other adjustments non gaap income before income tax expense benefit gaap income tax expense benefit adjustment to reflect tax effect of non gaap adjustments adjustment to remove benefit of one time income tax credits and other adjustments non gaap income tax expense non gaap net income about our supplemental and non gaap financial measures this form k contains supplemental and non gaap financial measures of our performance non gaap measures for different periods 
non gaap measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
our non gaap measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting  and differ both from gaap financial measures and from non gaap measures used by other companies 
we urge investors to review our reconciliation of non gaap measures to gaap financial measures  and our financial statements to evaluate our business 
we believe that our non gaap measures provide meaningful information regarding operating results because they exclude amounts that we exclude when monitoring operating results and assessing performance of the business 
we believe that our non gaap measures also facilitate comparison of results for current periods and business outlook for future periods 
our non gaap measures include the following adjustments we exclude share based compensation expense  including expense for stock options under sfas no 
r primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the business  and excluding these expenses facilitates comparison of results for 
table of contents fiscal to prior periods 
we believe that because share based compensation is non cash in nature  excluding these amounts from non gaap measures provides a more focused view of the business operations and improves comparability across periods 
share based compensation is difficult to forecast  because the magnitude of the charge depends upon the volume and timing of equity grants which are unpredictable and can vary dramatically from period to period and other factors such as interest rates  the trading price and volatility of our common stock and employee terminations 
we exclude a one time charge that we incurred in connection with our conversion 
as an agricultural cooperative association  we were required to use net realizable value nrv accounting for certain inventories  as a for profit corporation  we are required to use the lower of cost or market method to value all inventories 
as a result of using nrv accounting  certain inventories were valued higher than they would have been under the lower of cost or market method 
therefore  as these inventories were sold  the amount charged to cost of goods sold was higher 
we excluded this charge because it is non recurring and is not indicative of ongoing operations 
we exclude the following other operating expenses restructuring expenses which are principally related to the closure of our lemont facility and the costs incurred to consolidate operations in our fishers facility  the estimated costs of terminating two contracts  one with pg e associated with our cogeneration plant and one associated with a former distributor for germany  and the professional service fees associated with the california enterprise zone tax credits for years prior to discussed below 
our management believes it is useful to investors to exclude these amounts since they are non recurring in nature and are not reflective of the operating results of diamond on an on going basis 
we exclude the income tax benefit associated with california enterprise zone tax credits for years prior to amounting to approximately million million net of federal income tax impact since these credits have a one time impact 
our management believes its on going effective tax rate will be approximately and reflects such tax rate in its non gaap financial information 
we include the estimated cost of walnuts received from members in and our management believes that information is useful to investors because our financial statements for periods prior to july  did not include walnut acquisition costs which are now included in our financial statements 
accordingly  gross margins after this date are materially different than those reported in the historical cooperative financial statements 
our management uses non gaap measures in internal reports used to monitor and make decisions about our business  such as monthly financial reports prepared for management 
the principal limitation of the non gaap measures is that they exclude significant expenses required under gaap 
they also reflect the exercise of management s judgments about which adjustments are appropriately made to be non gaap measures 
to mitigate this limitation  we present the non gaap measures in connection with gaap results  and recommend that investors do not give undue weight to them 
we believe that non gaap measures provide useful information to investors by allowing them to view the business through the eyes of management  facilitating comparison of results across historical and future periods  and providing a focus on the underlying operating performance of the business 
results of operations compared to net sales were million and million for the years ended july  and the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher prices and to sales from the acquired harmony business  partially offset by lower volume 
volume decreased from million pounds sold in to million pounds sold in excluding harmony products 
the increase in prices reflected higher commodity costs for raw materials  which we were able to pass on  in part  to consumers 
this higher pricing was principally for walnuts  pecans and almonds

net sales by channel in thousands change from to north american retail international north american ingredient food service other total north american retail represents sales of our culinary  snack and in shell nuts in north america 
the increase in north american retail sales reflects the expansion of our emerald brand snack products  sales of which were million in compared to million in  sales of approximately million of harmony products  price increases on various products  and increased volume for culinary products  particularly in the mass merchandisers and club channels 
international and ingredient food service sales decreased as a result of less product available to sell due to lower ending inventory at july  the decline in volume was partially offset by higher pricing 
sales of walnuts and other nuts as a percentage of gross sales were as follows walnuts other nuts total gross margin 
gross margin was for the year ended july  this percentage included a one time charge to cost of sales as described above

there was no such charge in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were and for the years ended july  and advertising 
advertising expense was and million for the years ended july  and the change related principally to the timing of certain advertising programs and to initial emerald advertising associated with its national launch in other operating expenses 
other operating expenses totaled million in and consist of restructuring expenses of million principally related to the closure of our lemont facility and the consolidation of operations in our fishers facility  costs related to terminating two contracts of million  one with pg e associated with our cogeneration plant and one associated with a former distributor for germany  and professional service fees of million related to the identification of california enterprise zone tax credits as described in the income tax benefit section below 
interest 
net interest expense was million and million for the years ended july  and this decrease reflected lower borrowings due to repayment of indebtedness and utilization of cash from the july initial public offering to fund working capital requirements

as an agricultural cooperative association in  income taxes were not provided on patronage net proceeds 
income taxes were provided based on the pre tax income of our non patronage business 
the benefit in the year ended july  arose from the loss before income taxes of the non patronage business and from establishing certain net deferred tax assets related to the former patronage business as a result of the conversion 
effective august   all of our business activities are taxable under provisions of the internal revenue code and certain state tax laws 
income tax expense for is expected to be approximately of pre tax income

net sales by channel in thousands change from to north american retail international north american ingredient food service other total north american retail represents sales of our culinary  snack and in shell nuts in north america 
the increase in north american retail sales resulted from the national launch of our emerald brand snack nut products  sales of which were million in compared to million in  price increases on various products  reflecting increased commodity costs  and increased volume for culinary products  particularly in the mass merchandisers channel 
this increase in net sales was partially offset by an increase in introductory payments of million for our snack nut products compared to the prior year 
international sales increased as a result of expanded distribution of walnuts into the german retail markets and increased demand from existing customers in korea in the bakery and confectionary markets 
north american ingredient sales increased due to increased shipments to the usda school lunch program  volume increases in the baking and food service channels as the rising prices of other nuts made walnuts more attractive to these customers and initial shipments to a major restaurant chain for its new product launch 
sales of walnuts and other nuts as a percentage of total gross sales were walnuts other nuts total proceeds before operating expenses 
proceeds before operating expenses were million and million for the years ended july  and the principal reason for the increase was the growth in net sales offset by higher costs of nuts other than walnuts

advertising expense was million and million for the years ended july  and the change related principally from a net increase of approximately million in costs associated with the launch of our emerald brand snack nut products 
interest 
net interest expense was million and million for the years ended july  and the increase was due to additional borrowings required to fund working capital in support of sales growth and increased average interest rates 
income taxes 
income tax benefit was million and nil for the years ended july  and as an agricultural cooperative association  income taxes were not provided on patronage net proceeds 
income taxes have been provided at the statutory rate based on the pre tax income of our non patronage business 
the benefit in the year ended july  arises from the loss before income taxes of the non patronage business generated by start up costs  promotional activities  introductory payments and increased advertising costs to support the national launch of our emerald brand snack nut products and from establishing certain net deferred tax assets related to the former patronage business as a result of the conversion 
net proceeds 
net proceeds were million and million for years ended july  and as a percentage of net sales  net proceeds declined from in to in  principally due to the additional costs incurred to support the national launch of our emerald brand snack nut products and higher commodity costs 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent upon funds generated from operations and external sources of financing 
as of july   we had a total of million of senior notes outstanding with two institutional investors

on a combined basis  we have million of available borrowing capacity 
as of july   we were in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under our credit facilities our investment in cobank represents our cost basis in its stock 
we are required to maintain this investment to comply with our borrowing agreements with cobank 
this investment cannot be readily converted to cash because we cannot dispose of it without the prior approval of cobank and only in the event of termination of our borrowing agreements with cobank 
working capital and stockholders equity were million and million at july  compared million and million at july

off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation may  however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices and interest rates on borrowings 
although we have international sales and related trade receivables from foreign customers  there is no significant foreign currency exchange risk as substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds and other nuts  are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash and cash equivalents  which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of less than days when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be an increase of pretax income of approximately million or a decrease of pretax income of million  respectively
