item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we deliver simple  secure and manageable enterprise mobility services  maximizing the productivity of workers as they move between office  home and remote locations 
our policy management services close the gaps in protecting computers  network assets  user identities and data whenever users connect over the internet 
our connectivity services utilize the ipass global virtual network  a unified network of hundreds of dial up  wireless  and broadband providers in over countries 
overview of in  we continued to experience a decline in revenues derived from our traditional dial up business as dial up revenue decreased to million in as compared to this decrease was offset in part by revenues generated from fees and from usage of our broadband service 
we also continued to add new customers during  including from the forbes global  bringing our total customers to as of december  as we continued to increase the number of broadband access points during the year  increasing our global broadband footprint was a priority for us in we ended with approximately  wi fi and wired hotspots worldwide  approximately  of which were wi fi hotspots and approximately  of which were wired hotspots 
this enabled our customers to remotely access their corporate networks from more locations  at higher speeds and contributed to a million increase in broadband usage revenue in over 
table of contents going forward  we will continue to focus on delivering innovative services and solutions for our customers  increasing the number of end users of our services for both dial up and broadband access  as well as continue to increase fee revenues from endpoint policy management and other fee based services 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our business 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section below entitled factors affecting operating results 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues primarily from providing enterprise connectivity services through our virtual network 
we sell these services directly  as well as indirectly through our channel partners 
we bill substantially all customers on a time basis for usage based on negotiated rates 
we bill the remaining customers based on a fixed charge per active user per month with additional charges for excess time 
substantially all enterprise customers commit to a one to three year contract term 
most of our contracts with enterprise customers contain minimum usage levels 
we bill customers for minimum commitments when actual usage is less than their monthly minimum commitment amount 
we recognize the difference between the minimum commitment and actual usage as fee revenue once the cash for such fee has been collected 
our usage based revenues represented  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have incurred expenses to expand our broadband coverage and are seeking to generate additional revenues from our broadband wired and wireless coverage 
revenues from usage of our broadband services were and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also provide customers with deployment services and technical support throughout the term of the contract 
we typically charge fees for these services on a one time or annual basis  depending on the service provided and the nature of the relationship 
in addition  we also offer customers additional services for which we generally bill on a monthly basis 
with the acquisition of mobile automation  inc in october of  we also began generating license and maintenance revenue through software licensing agreements 
revenues generated from license and maintenance fees  together with revenues generated from fees  represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition services and fees we derive substantially all of our revenues from usage fees 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been provided to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized during the period the services are rendered to end users based on usage at negotiated rates 
we typically require our customers to commit to minimum usage levels 
minimum usage 
table of contents levels can be based on an annual term  monthly term or over the term of the arrangement 
if actual usage in a given period is less than the minimum commitment  we recognize the difference between the actual usage and the minimum commitment as revenue when cash is collected because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference that will be collected 
we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference to be collected because we have from time to time renegotiated minimum commitments in cases where customers have sought renegotiation of their contract for reasons such as a significant downturn in their business or where we have determined that it would be in our best interest to do so 
customers are not contractually entitled to use or otherwise receive benefit for unused service in subsequent periods 
we typically provide our customers with deployment services  technical support and additional optional services 
depending on the service provided and the nature of the arrangement  we may charge a one time  annual or monthly fee 
revenues relating to one time fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the initial contract  generally one to three years as we can not reasonably estimate the period of performance 
revenues relating to annual fees are recognized on a straight line basis 
revenues for monthly services are recognized during the month that these services are provided 
license and maintenance license revenue consists of revenue earned under software license agreements 
license revenue is generally recognized when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable as prescribed by aicpa statement of portion sop we enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software  upgrades and maintenance and support multiple element arrangements 
when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
vsoe of fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by aicpa statement of position sop revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products on a when and if available basis and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  which is generally subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing software updates on a when and if available basis and technical support for software products post contract support or pcs 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
payments received in advance of services performed are deferred 
allowances for estimated future returns and discounts are provided for upon recognition of revenue 
the company generally performs credit reviews to evaluate the customers ability to pay 
if the company determines that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our consolidated statements of income as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
when we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in 
table of contents assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we would increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at december  included three years of historical operating profits and a projection of future income limited to three years which coincides with the period over which we recorded historical operating profits 
we continue to closely monitor available evidence and may adjust our valuation allowance in future periods 
although we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee this will be the case as our ability to use the net operating losses is contingent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period 
at each period end  we reassess our ability to realize our net operating losses 
if we conclude it is more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of our net operating losses  we may have to re establish all or a portion of the valuation allowance and therefore record a significant charge to our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a detailed assessment of accounts receivable for specific  as well as anticipated  uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an increased general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue total revenue increased slightly in as compared to due to offsetting factors 
revenues generated from dial up usage decreased from million in to million in this represents a decrease of million or 
this was offset in part by increases in revenues generated from broadband usage and fees 
revenues generated from usage of our broadband services were million and million dollars for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fee revenue increased from million in to million in we expect revenue from dial up usage to continue to decrease in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of total revenue  but we can not reasonably estimate if the decline will be consistent with that seen from to no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenues for the years ended december   or revenues from fees represented approximately  and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
the growth in total revenue in over was due primarily to an increase in the usage of our services resulting from an increased number of end users of our services at new and existing customers

no individual foreign country accounted for or more of total revenues in to date  substantially all of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars  although in the future some portion of revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies 
operating expenses network access network access expenses consist of charges for access  principally by the minute  that we pay to our network service providers 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages network access expenses as a percent of revenue the growth in network access expenses in over was due primarily to increased usage of our virtual network with respect to our broadband services 
for our dial up access costs  we continued to purchase network access from additional service providers at a lower cost and to renegotiate a number of our existing network service provider contracts in while network access costs for broadband access are higher than those for dial up  we believe that going forward  we will have the ability to negotiate lower rates for access to broadband networks 
we expect network access expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of revenues as usage of our virtual network increases 
the growth in network access expenses in over was due primarily to increased usage of our virtual network

we anticipate that our operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
commitments at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have signed contracts with some network service providers under which we have minimum purchase commitments that expire on various dates through december other than in the approximately countries in which our sole dial up network service provider is equant  we have contracted with multiple network service providers to provide alternative access points in a given geographic area 
in those geographic areas where we provide access through multiple providers  we are able to direct users to the network of particular service providers 
consequently  we believe we have the ability to fulfill our minimum purchase commitments in these geographic areas

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency although we currently bill our services in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our network service providers in us dollars 
in the future  some portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies

our investment portfolio consists of auction rate and money market securities  asset backed securities  corporate securities  and government securities  generally due within one to two years 
all of our instruments are classified as available for sale 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  a hypothetical increase or decrease in current interest rates would not materially affect our interest income  although there can be no assurance of this 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase  which we held solely for non trading purposes

we consider all investments to be short term investments  which are classified in the balance sheet as current assets  because the investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity and the investments are selected for yield management purposes only and we are not committed to holding the investments until maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date
