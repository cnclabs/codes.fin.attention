table of contents overview retail ventures is a holding company operating retail stores in three segments  value city department stores  filene s basement and dsw 
value city is a full line  value price retailer carrying men s  women s and children s apparel  accessories  jewelry  shoes  home fashions  electronics and seasonal items 
located in the midwestern  eastern and southern united states and operating for over years  value city s strategy has been to provide exceptional value by offering a broad selection of brand name merchandise at prices substantially below conventional retail prices 
as of january   there were value city stores in operation 
dsw is a leading us specialty branded footwear retailer operating shoe stores in states as of january  dsw offers a wide selection of brand name and designer dress  casual and athletic footwear for women and men 
dsw s typical customers are brand  quality and style conscious shoppers who have a passion for footwear and accessories 
filene s basement stores are located primarily in major metropolitan areas of the united states such as boston  new york  atlanta  chicago and washington  dc filene s basement s mission is to provide the best selection of stylish  high end designer and famous brand name merchandise at surprisingly affordable prices in men s and women s apparel  jewelry  shoes  accessories and home goods 
as of january   there were filene s basement stores in operation 
we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
the discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes as of january   and the year then ended 
on july   dsw completed an ipo of  class a common shares sold at a price to the public of per share and raising net proceeds of million  net of the underwriters commission and before expenses of approximately million 
as of january   retail ventures owned class b common shares of dsw representing approximately of dsw s outstanding common shares and approximately of the combined voting power of such shares 
dsw is a controlled subsidiary of retail ventures and its class a common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol dsw 
the retail industry is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of conventional and discount retail stores  including national  regional and local independent department and specialty stores  as well as with catalog operations  on line providers  factory outlet stores and other off price stores 
our operating entities  value city  dsw and filene s basement  have different target customers and different strategies  but each focus on this basic principle the value to the customer is the result of the quality of the merchandise in relationship to the price paid 
key financial measures in evaluating the results of operations  our management refers to a number of key financial and non financial measures relating to the performance of our business segments 
among our key financial results are net sales  operating profit  and net income 
non financial measures that we use in evaluating our performance include number of stores  leased operations  net sales per average gross square foot for our stores  and change in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year 
for fiscal and prior years  we considered comparable store sales to be sales at stores that were open months as of the prior fiscal year end 
comparable store sales are also referred to as comp store sales by others within the retail industry 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the company s revenues are generated through sales from existing stores and through sales from new stores 
in no new value city stores were opened  dsw opened new stores and filene s basement opened one new store 
for fiscal we plan to open approximately four new filene s basement and additional dsw stores 
no new value city stores are presently planned to be opened in fiscal as we continue the implementation and refinement of our new merchandising strategy in the existing store base 
fiscal year  seasonality we follow a week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to january in each year 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks 
our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses 
historically  the majority of our sales and operating profit have been generated during the early spring  back to school and christmas selling seasons for our value city segment and  more recently  our filene s basement segment 
dsw net sales have typically been higher in spring and early fall  when dsw s customers interest in new seasonal styles increases 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies  litigation and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from merchandise sales are recognized at the point of sale and are net of returns and exclude sales tax 
revenue from gift cards is deferred and is recognized upon redemption of the gift cards 
layaway sales are recognized when the merchandise has been paid for in full 
the layaway program was discontinued in fiscal cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
accordingly earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
reserves to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  reduction of pricing due to customers value perception or perceived value known as markdowns  and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging 
table of contents process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  and the resulting gross margins 
asset impairment and long lived assets 
we must periodically evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and finite life intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review to ascertain if any assets have been impaired 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows from the asset 
our reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level  which includes a store 
the impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying value  based on discounted future cash flows  of the asset over its fair value 
should an impairment loss be realized  it will be included in operating expenses 
assets acquired for stores that have been previously impaired are not capitalized when acquired if the store s expected future cash flow remains negative 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million  million including the impairment of a capital lease of million related to a store closing and million in charges  respectively  related to long lived assets at store operating units 
during fiscal we recorded a non cash charge of million  million net of taxes  for the impairment of goodwill related to filene s basement 
the balance of goodwill subject to goodwill annual testing at the end of the current fiscal year was million on the dsw segment 
we believe at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of long lived assets continue to be appropriate 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
these estimates are based on actuarial assumptions and are subject to change based on actual results 
should the total cost of claims for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance exceed or fall short of those anticipated  reserves recorded may not be appropriate  and  to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements starting on page f of this annual report 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plans were discount rate  assumed salary increases and long term rate of return on plan assets 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
dsw maintains a customer loyalty program for our dsw stores in which customers receive a future discount on qualifying purchases 
the reward your style program is designed to promote customer awareness and loyalty plus provide dsw with the ability to communicate with our customers and enhance our understanding of their spending trends 
while the program develops customer loyalty  it also provides dsw with valuable market intelligence and purchasing information regarding its 
table of contents most frequent customers 
upon reaching the target level  customers may redeem these discounts on a future purchase 
generally  these future discounts must be redeemed within six months 
we accrue the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase and charge such costs to selling  general and administrative expense based on historical experience 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty program require us to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates 
the accrued liability as of january  and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent assumptions of purchases and redemption rates vary from actual results  earnings would be impacted 
during the third quarter of  filene s basement implemented a limited time customer rewards program that ended in december the rewards program provided qualifying customers with filene s basement gift cards in various denominations based on their cumulative spending during the program period 
filene s basement had an accrued liability related to the rewards program of million at january  these rewards were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal  and no liability remains at january  change in fair value of warrants 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 changes in the fair values are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
prior to fiscal the company did not have any derivatives designated as hedges 
during fiscal the company recorded a charge related to the change in the fair value of the warrants of million  including a million charge relating to the initial recording of the conversion warrants 
the initial recording and change in fair value of the warrants were non cash in nature 
income taxes 
we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction we do business in 
in making these estimates  we adjust income based on a determination of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if our management had made these determinations on a different basis  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve of million for state net operating loss carry forwards and wrote off million of deferred tax assets no longer deductible as a result of changes in state income tax laws in ohio 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve for deferred income tax assets of million for carry forwards related to state net operating losses 
during fiscal  we established a valuation reserve for deferred income tax assets of million for charitable contribution carry forwards 
following the completion of the dsw initial public offering ipo in june  dsw is no longer included in retail ventures consolidated federal tax return 
results of operations we operate three business operating segments 
value city and filene s basement segments operate full line  off price department stores 
our dsw segment is a leading specialty branded footwear retailer

table of contents fiscal year ended january  fiscal compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal sales 
sales for fiscal increased by to billion from billion for fiscal by operating segment  comparable store sales were value city department stores dsw filene s basement total value city net sales decreased by million to billion  or decrease over the comparable period for fiscal during fiscal  value city transitioned to a new merchandise strategy which includes more name brand merchandise  better assortments and more upfront purchasing 
the transition occurred throughout fiscal and was substantially in place for the women s and shoe categories by the third quarter 
the sales for comparable stores decreased due to declines in transactions  an incomplete conversion of other departments in the store to the new merchandising strategy and the short term effect of eliminating certain merchandise categories 
all stores in the value city segment are in the comparative stores base 
in addition  during fiscal  value city operated two fewer stores than in the previous year another value city store closed on january   not affecting fiscal 
these two stores had net sales of million in the fiscal the decrease in comparable sales is comprised of decreases in men s  children s  shoes and hardlines of   and  respectively 
jewelry and women s sales increased over the comparable period by and  respectively 
for fiscal  the number of transactions in the value city segment increased by and the average unit retail increased while the number of units in the basket decreased 
additionally  value city began the elimination of the health and beauty aids and non gourmet food categories in july these categories represent and of total segment sales in the fiscal years and  respectively 
dsw net sales were billion  a million  or  increase over fiscal comparable store sales improved 
the increase in dsw sales includes a net increase of dsw stores  non affiliated leased shoe departments and one filene s basement leased shoe department  and does not include the re categorization in fiscal of two dsw filene s basement combination stores as leased shoe departments which are included in the dsw segment 
the dsw store locations and the leased shoe departments that opened subsequent to january  added sales of million and million  respectively 
leased shoe department sales comprised of total net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal dsw comparable sales in the merchandise categories of women s  athletics and men s had increases of  and  respectively  and decreased in the accessories category by 
sales increases in women s were across all categories  dress  casual and seasonal 
the seasonal performance of boots drove the women s increase with a increase for the year 
the increase in athletic was driven by women s  and specifically women s fashion athletic 
the increase in men s was driven by expanded assortment offering in casual and fashion 
the decrease in accessories was due to a narrowing of the offering in gift products 
filene s basement net sales increased million  or  in the year to million 
filene s basement had a net increase of one store over the prior year s period and a comparable store sales increase of 
net sales for the new stores opened in fiscal added million to sales 
the merchandise categories of men s  women s

gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or from billion to billion 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales  decreased to compared to for the prior year s period 
the decrease in the overall margin rate is attributable to the decrease in gross profit from the value city and dsw segments  offset in part by increases at the filene s basement segment 
gross profit  as a percent of sales by segment  was value city dsw filene s basement total value city s gross profit decreased million from fiscal the decrease is attributable to several factors  including lower initial markups as a result of the shift toward a new merchandising strategy focused on more name brand merchandise and better assortments at compelling prices 
these new merchandise items have higher initial costs  thus lower initial markups imu which we believe along with the shift in strategy will improve our sell through 
value city also incurred additional markdowns related to increased point of sales discounts on clearance merchandise  on merchandise that would not be carried into the new strategy  and categories that did not execute to the new merchandising strategy in children s and hardlines areas 
the dsw gross profit increased million to million in fiscal from million in  and decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease  as a percentage of sales  is primarily attributable to increased markdowns in all categories 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in initial markup 
the initial markup increase is the result of increased average unit retail prices and the ability to buy at lower costs  due to the fact that dsw placed larger orders 
the imu increases are not expected to continue at the same pace as in prior years 
filene s basement gross profit increased by million in fiscal attributable to the addition of one new store  the full year results of five stores opened in fiscal and the reduction of markdowns necessary to address aged inventory from the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal total sg a expense associated with new dsw and filene s basement stores and new leased shoe departments not opened in the prior year  excluding pre opening costs  were million 
pre opening costs decreased approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal

adoption of accounting standards the fasb periodically issues statement of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of the company s fiscal year 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and requires a fair value measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and recognition of those expenses in the statements of operations 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services and focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
in addition  sfas no 
r will require the recognition of compensation expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award 
the effective date of this statement was originally established to apply to interim and annual periods beginning after june  in april  however  the sec delayed the compliance date for sfas no 
r until the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the company will utilize the modified prospective method of adoption 
the company expects the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r to the company s results of operations will be similar to the pro forma disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f in november   the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
while the timing and or method of settlement is unknown  the obligation to perform the asset retirement obligation is unconditional 
fin requires that the fair value of the asset retirement activity be recorded when it can be reasonably estimated 
the adoption of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flow or results of operations 

table of contents inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor  however  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store inventory purchases  capital expenditures in connection with expansion and remodeling and infrastructure growth  primarily information technology development 
the primary sources of funds for these liquidity needs are cash flow from operations and credit facilities 
our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall  peaking during the winter holiday selling season for our value city and filene s basement segments 
net working capital was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
current ratios at those dates were and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease of million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the i million decrease in working capital provided from the change in working capital assets and liabilities  ii million increase in the fiscal net loss and iii million non cash change in fair value of warrants 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the net cash increase is reflective of several items  primarily the increase in accounts payable of million and the increase of accrued expenses of million and an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the increases in inventories due to new stores were million for dsw  million for leased departments and million for filene s basement 
cash used for capital expenditures was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and excludes the impact of capital expenditures in accounts payable
