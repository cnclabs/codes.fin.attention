item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech nv fuel tech is a technology company that provides advanced engineering solutions for the optimization of combustion systems in utility and industrial applications 
fuel tech currently generates revenues from the following product lines nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies fuel tech markets a suite of nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies 
these include the noxout  noxout cascade  and noxout scr processes  which use the injection of chemicals to reduce nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources to meet statutory nox reduction requirements worldwide 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
the current driver for growth in this business is the ozone transport sip state implementation plan call  which required states to decrease their nox emissions by may  this regulation impacts utility boilers and large industrial boilers see below for more detail on the sip call 
fuel tech believes that the implementation of the sip call will extend well beyond the may  implementation date 
fuel treatment chemicals fuel tech s proprietary tifi targeted in furnace injection technology centers on the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the performance of combustion units 
specifically  this technology is used to address slagging  fouling  corrosion and plume abatement in furnaces and boilers through the injection of chemicals into the fuel or via tifi 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
although coal sourced from a variety of geographic areas have proven to provide utility units with operational difficulty  fuel tech believes the largest market opportunity for this product line to be those units burning western coals  many of which have significant operational issues related to the formation of slag 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
fuel tech discusses its critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the nitrogen oxide reduction business segment 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
different results are possible when using different assumptions 
fuel tech s construction contracts are typically six to twelve months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical milestones that serve as the basis for fuel tech to invoice the customer 
at a minimum  the milestones will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold to the customer 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by fuel tech are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
fuel tech has installed over units with the technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  fuel tech will perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
fuel tech believes that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts fuel tech  in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with its customer base  reviews the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of fuel tech s management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
fuel tech s historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   fuel tech adopted fasb financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the guidance of this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather  are required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
fuel tech reviews other intangible assets  which include a customer list  a covenant not to compete and patent assets  for impairment on a recurring basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates of future cash flows are made  however  the actual cash values that could be realized may differ from those that are estimated 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
upon review of its potential sources of taxable income  fuel tech has concluded that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fuel tech considers if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carryback the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies which can be readily implemented 
fuel tech is a company whose revenues are generated from a customer base that is heavily regulated 
this fact lends some uncertainty to the ability of the company to project forward looking income with precision 
versus net sales for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year on year increase of  or  reflects gains from both the nitrogen oxide reduction nox and fuel treatment chemical business segments 
revenues for the nox product line were  in  an increase of over this business segment  which began to show increased strength in the second half of  continues to experience a surge in order activity 
utilities and industrial facilities that are impacted by the environmental protection agency s epa state implementation plan sip call regulation  which became effective on may   continue to prove that fuel tech s technology is a viable tool in their ongoing regulatory compliance planning 
fuel tech s strategy in addressing this market has involved the development of alliance agreements with critical customers looking to finalize their compliance plans 
the sip call  introduced in  is the federal mandate that required states to reduce nox emissions by may on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back thirteen months to may   states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by october of these plans  which the epa had until october to approve  will potentially impact to utility boilers and to industrial units 
although the sip call was the subject of litigation  an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of this regulation 
this court s ruling was later affirmed by the us supreme court 
in february  the us supreme court  in a unanimous decision  upheld epa s authority to revise the national ambient air quality standard for ozone to parts per million averaged through an eight hour period from the current parts per million for a one hour period 
this more stringent standard provides clarity and impetus for air pollution control efforts well beyond the current ozone attainment requirement of in keeping with this trend  the supreme court  only days later  denied industry s attempt to stay the sip call  effectively exhausting all means of appeal 
on december   the epa proposed a new regulation that affects the sip call states by calling for more nox reductions in and also  deep nox reductions are called for in additional states outside the current sip call region 
the proposed rule allows a cap and trade format similar to the sip call 
this rule  under the name clean air interstate rule  became final on march  revenues for the fuel treatment chemical business segment were  in  an increase of over this segment s growth  although indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  would have been enhanced had revenues not been hampered by the following circumstances during demonstration programs there were several demonstration programs during  five of which have not yielded commercial revenues at december  one was a no cost demonstration at a critical coal fired utility and one was a demonstration at a large coal fired utility offered at of commercial value 
these two successful demonstrations had the impact of reducing revenue by approximately  and this revenue is non recoverable 
the other three demonstrations were structured on a cost share basis and all were on coal fired units 
under cost share arrangements  during the demonstration period  fuel tech will invoice the customer at a specified percentage of the commercial price 
at the end of the demonstration  if fuel tech meets the criteria for success that were established for the program  fuel tech will invoice the customer for the remaining percentage of the commercial price 
these latter three demonstrations are expected to reach their evaluation date in the first quarter of if revenue was recognized at commercial pricing for these latter demonstrations  an incremental  in revenue would have been realized in coal supply chain issues rail disruptions in the powder river basin during impacted several utilities ability to receive and burn powder river basin coal 
the required repair and maintenance work on several rail lines is expected to impact coal shipments in several parts of the country well into this market dynamic negatively impacted fuel tech s revenue generating capability in as more than one critical western coal fired utility unit was forced to reduce capacity for an extended period of time due to transportation related shortages of western coal deliveries 
new sales initiatives were also negatively influenced by these issues as potential new customers were forced to delay their evaluation and implementation of the fuel chem technology 
oil pricing the high price of oil has resulted in reduced oil fired electricity generation in the united states 
fuel tech s oil fired business was negatively impacted by this market dynamic in fuel tech s tifi technology alleviates the slagging and fouling issues associated with burning coals that are high in low melting point ash constituents  such as sodium 
more than half of the coal burned in the united states today to generate electricity is western coal and it is western coal that has higher levels of low melting point ash constituents 
due to its lower cost and lower pollutant content relative to eastern coals  and despite the rail issues noted above  it is anticipated that western coals will be burned in larger quantities and in an increasing number of facilities 
the penetration of the western coal fired utility market remains the top priority for this business segment 
during  demonstrations were performed on utility units that burn illinois basin coal 
the utilization of this coal  whose high iron content also can create slagging and fouling issues  is likely to provide the fuel chem product line with an additional market niche 
in addition to the above  new technical markets being explored and pursued by fuel chem include the so plume abatement market  which is a key concern in many utility and industrial operations today  as well as the corrosion reduction market for the municipal solid waste incineration industry 
both areas represent market opportunities for fuel tech 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  declined to from in the prior year 
this improvement is primarily attributable to the nitrogen oxide business  where the percentage decreased to in from in the decrease is attributable to the mix of project business 
the cost of sales percentage for the fuel treatment chemical business increased to in from in the increase is due to the impact of the demonstration programs discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of the  variance with  almost  was due to employee related costs including the wages and benefits resulting from the addition of new personnel  recruiting costs  and incentive compensation 
revenue related internal and external commission accounted for  of the increase 
the remainder of the variance is attributable to audit and audit related fees for sarbanes oxley compliance and legal and consulting fees derived from fuel tech s strategic desire to engage in business in new geographies 
research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for technologies related to its core businesses  with a particular focus on its fuel chem technologies 
other expense was  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  the year on year reduction in expense is comprised of an  increase in interest income resulting from a higher average cash balance in versus and an increase in market interest rates 
this increase was offset by transaction losses related to balances denominated in foreign currencies 
fuel tech s income tax benefit of  for predominantly represents the recording of the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance representing the anticipated utilization of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income  fuel tech concluded that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses and the research and development tax credits would be utiized in subsequent periods and the valuation allowance was no longer required 
at december   fuel tech recorded a  reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which represented the anticipated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in subsequent periods 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income  fuel tech had concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion of the net operating losses would be utilized in subsequent periods and that a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance was required 
versus net sales for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year on year decline reflects a reduction in revenues derived from the nox reduction project product line 
revenues for this product line were million in versus million in as referred to in previous filings  although the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation became effective as of may   there were several factors that led to a slowing of equipment orders in the air pollution control business late in and during the first half of nox allowance prices for were depressed as a result of weak demand for power  the existence of a shortened ozone season and due to the allocation of supplemental nox allowances 
consequently  some utilities were able to delay capital spending related to nox control and they met their emissions reduction requirements on a short term basis through the purchase of allowances and other temporary means 
in addition  many utilities continued to experience significant capital constraints 
based on these market factors  the air pollution control business weakened during the latter portion of and the first half of as expected  the second half of began to show improvement with the receipt of several air pollution control project orders 
the decline in nox reduction project revenues was partially offset by record fuel treatment chemical revenues 
revenues for the fuel chem product line increased to million from million in  an increase of almost 
revenues derived from western coal fired utility boilers had the largest year on year impact  and contributions from the customer contracts acquired from martin marietta magnesia specialties  llc on september   also contributed to the increase 
fuel tech believes that attaining success on additional western coal fired utility boilers will lead to more expedient penetration of the western coal fired utility market 
sales and marketing efforts are intensely focused on penetrating this market as it represents the largest opportunity for the fuel treatment chemical business 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  declined to from in the prior year due to two primary reasons 
first  a significantly larger percentage of the revenues for the month period ended december  were generated by the fuel treatment chemical product line 
the gross margins realized by the fuel treatment chemical product line are typically higher than the nox reduction project business 
secondarily  a larger percentage of the nox reduction project revenues generated for the year ended december  were generated by nox reduction turnkey projects than in when fuel tech receives a nox reduction project order from a customer  the scope of the project can include two components 
first  there is the fuel tech equipment scope for a project and second  there is an installation scope for a project 
due to its patented technology  fuel tech s equipment scope for a project generates a higher gross margin than does the installation scope for a project 
historically  most nox reduction projects undertaken by fuel tech have not included the installation scope of a project and this portion of the work has been the responsibility of the end customer 
when fuel tech is responsible for both components of the project scope  the overall project margin is reduced 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of the  increase   was due to employment related costs for sales and marketing personnel related to the fuel treatment chemical business 
market penetration of fuel tech s tifi technology in the coal fired utility market remains a strategic priority 
the remainder of the variance was due primarily to an increase in engineering expenses which was driven by the reduction in nox reduction project activity 
when engineering employees are specifically working on nox reduction projects their costs are classified as cost of sales 
research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for technologies related to its core businesses  with a particular focus on its fuel chem technologies 
there was no interest expense recorded for the year ended december   while  was recorded during fuel tech paid off the entirety of its outstanding debt balance in the second quarter of other expense was  for the year ended december  versus other income of  for the year ended december  the decline is principally due to recording an impairment loss for certain patent assets in the amount of  in additionally  fuel tech had lower interest income in resulting from a lower average outstanding cash balance in versus fuel tech s income tax benefit of  for predominantly represents the recording of a  reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance representing the anticipated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in subsequent years 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income fuel tech concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion of the net operating losses would be utilized in subsequent years and that a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance was required 
the  in tax expense that offsets this amount primarily represents state income tax expense 
fuel tech did not record a financial impact from income taxes in liquidity and sources of capital at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of  respectively 
operating activities provided  of cash in primarily due to fuel tech s operating profit plus depreciation and amortization 
investing activities used cash of  during the year 
of this amount   was an increase in short term investments 
the remaining  was used in the purchase of equipment and patents  primarily related to the fuel treatment chemical business 
lastly  fuel tech generated cash from the exercise of stock options in the amount of fuel tech  inc fti has a million revolving credit facility expiring july   which is collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
fti can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
cash advances under this facility bear interest based on the following the bank prime rate reduced by a range of zero to basis points  or the bank interbank offering rate increased by a range of to basis points the company can choose which rate to apply to borrowings 
at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fti is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately  was available 
there were no interest payments for the years ended december  or interest payments of  were made during the year ended december  in the opinion of management  fuel tech s expected near term revenue growth will be driven by the timing of penetration of the coal fired utility marketplace via utilization of its tifi technology  by various entities implementation of the nox reduction requirements of the caaa domestically  and by the expansion of both business segments in non us geographies 
fuel tech expects its liquidity requirements to be met by the operating results generated from these activities 
contractual obligations and commitments in its normal course of business  fuel tech enters into agreements that obligate fuel tech to make future payments 
the operating lease obligations noted below are primarily related to supporting the normal operations of the business and are not recognized as liabilities in fuel tech s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash total less than years years thereafter obligations year operating leases  fuel tech has a sublease agreement that obligates the lessee to make future payments to fti 
the sublease obligations noted below are related to a sublease agreement between fti and american bailey corporation abc 
abc will reimburse fti for its share of lease and lease related expenses under fti s january  lease of its executive offices in stamford  connecticut

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fuel tech s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fuel tech does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
fuel tech is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
