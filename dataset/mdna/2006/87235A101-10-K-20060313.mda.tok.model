item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share data and as noted the discussion and analysis that follows focuses on our results of operations during   and and financial condition at december  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with this review 
certain amounts in years prior to have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
general we  td banknorth inc  are a delaware corporation and a registered bank financial holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
we are a majority owned subsidiary of the toronto dominion bank and successor to banknorth group  inc at december   we had consolidated assets of billion and consolidated shareholders equity of billion 
based on total assets at that date  we were the th largest commercial banking organization in the united states 
our principal asset is all of the capital stock of td banknorth  na  a national bank which was initially formed as a maine chartered savings bank in the mid th century 
at december   td banknorth  na had banking offices in maine  new hampshire  vermont  massachusetts  connecticut and eastern new york and served approximately million households and commercial customers 
through td banknorth  na and its subsidiaries  we offer a full range of banking services and products to individuals  businesses and governments throughout our market areas  including commercial banking  consumer banking  investment management  investment planning and insurance agency services 

table of contents business strategy our goal is to sustain profitable  controlled growth by focusing on increasing our loan and deposit market share in our market areas  developing new financial products  services and delivery channels  closely managing yields on earning assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities  increasing noninterest income through  among other things  expanded wealth management  investment planning and insurance agency services  controlling the growth of noninterest expenses and maintaining strong asset quality 
as discussed below under acquisitions  it is also part of our business strategy to supplement internal growth with targeted acquisitions of other financial institutions and insurance agencies in our current or contiguous market areas 
we strive to maintain a diversified loan and deposit mix and strong asset quality 
we are focused on improving efficiencies as we integrate all of our acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate our operations and organizational structure to ensure they are closely aligned with our goal of increasing earnings per share 
executive overview was a transformational year as the toronto dominion bank acquired a majority interest in us on march  as discussed below under acquisition by the toronto dominion bank  we were required to use the purchase method of accounting to account for this transaction and  as a result  goodwill increased by billion  identifiable intangible assets increased by million and shareholders equity increased by billion 
in addition to this landmark event  we acquired bostonfed bancorp in january  purchased the naming rights to the td banknorth garden the premier sports and entertainment arena in new england  reached agreement in july to acquire hudson united bancorp  the largest acquisition in our history  which was completed on january  and expanded our operations into southern connecticut  the new york metropolitan area  new jersey and philadelphia  pennsylvania  and continued to restructure our balance sheet by reducing the level of fixed rate securities in our investment portfolio that have extension prepayment risk 
each of these items had substantial costs associated with their execution and as a result  net income and earnings per share declined from the prior year 
however  we believe that each of these items has positioned us well for the future 
diluted earnings per share were in compared to in  a decline of 
net income was million in as compared to million in  a decline of million  or 
amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets increased by million million after tax due to our use of the purchase method of accounting to account for the transaction with the toronto dominion bank on march   while losses related to balance sheet restructuring increased by million million after tax 
balance sheet restructuring losses include losses on securities  lower of cost or market adjustments on certain residential loans moved to loans held for sale and prepayment penalties on borrowings 
the following summarizes our results for the year ended as compared to the year ended net interest income increased by million 
although total average earning assets increased only slightly over the prior year  average investment securities declined by billion primarily the result of balance sheet deleveraging programs while average loans increased by billion related to acquisitions and organic growth 
this shift in mix of earning assets from investment securities to higher yielding loans enhanced net interest income during a period of sustained increases in short term interest rates 
net interest income and the net interest margin declined during the last two quarters of  however  as a result of the flattening yield curve 
the provision for loan losses declined by million  reflecting continued strong asset quality and lower net charge offs 
noninterest income decreased by million or due to the effects of losses on securities and lower of cost or market adjustments on certain residential loans incurred primarily in connection with our balance sheet deleveraging and restructuring programs  which reduced noninterest income by million in the aggregate 
the other components of noninterest income increased by million or in the aggregate  largely due to increases in deposit services income and merchant and electronic banking income as a result of increased transaction volumes 

table of contents noninterest expense increased by million or due primarily to a million increase in the amortization of identifiable intangible assets as a result of our use of the purchase method of accounting to account for the transaction with the toronto dominion bank on march   which more than offset a million or decrease in merger and consolidation costs and a million or decrease in prepayment penalties on borrowings 
the other components of noninterest expense increased by million or in the aggregate as a result of expense associated with acquisitions completed in and  management retention agreements entered into in connection with the toronto dominion bank transaction and employee benefit programs  including restricted stock unit awards granted in that will be settled in cash 
our financial condition and liquidity rating remain strong 
the following are important factors in understanding our financial conditions and liquidity using the definition of federal banking regulators  we continue to be well capitalized  moody s rating of our senior notes was a at december   we increased our quarterly dividend by to per share in may  and our liquidity measures at december  and throughout the year met our policy guidelines 
acquisition by the toronto dominion bank the toronto dominion bank acquired its majority interest in us effective march  in a two step transaction in which banknorth group  inc first reincorporated from maine to delaware by means of a migratory merger into a newly formed  wholly owned delaware subsidiary of banknorth group  inc  and then the toronto dominion bank acquired its majority interest in us by means of the merger of a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the toronto dominion bank with and into this reincorporated entity  which changed its name to td banknorth inc upon completion of the transaction 
in accordance with the guidelines for accounting for business combinations  the transaction met the technical definition of a business combination  and therefore  was accounted for as a purchase business combination with the purchase price being comprised of all the consideration received by the shareholders of banknorth group  inc  namely cash paid by the toronto dominion bank  the value of the toronto dominion bank common shares issued and the value of td banknorth inc shares issued 
the purchase price and related purchase accounting adjustments resulted in a new basis of accounting reflecting the fair value of our assets and liabilities at march  the most significant adjustments were to increase goodwill by billion  identifiable intangible assets by million and shareholders equity by billion as of march  as a result of the increase in identifiable intangible assets  amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets for was million higher than in for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
financial information presented herein for all dates and periods prior to completion of the toronto dominion bank transaction on march  reflects our historical basis of accounting  and financial information presented herein for all dates and periods from and after march  reflect the adjusted values of our assets and liabilities resulting from the application of purchase accounting on that date 
to assist in the comparability of our financial results and to make it easier to discuss and understand our results of operations  the financial information presented herein for combines the predecessor period january  to february  with the successor period march  to december  to present combined results for year ended december  because of the effects of accounting for the toronto dominion bank transaction under the purchase method effective march   information on a combined basis for the year ended december  may not be comparable to information for the years ended december  and december   which are presented on a historical basis

we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and frequently conduct due diligence in connection with possible acquisitions 
as a result  acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations frequently take place and future acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities can be expected 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and therefore  some pro forma dilution of our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transactions 
moreover  acquisitions commonly result in significant one time charges against earnings  although cost savings  especially incident to in market acquisitions  frequently are anticipated  as are revenue enhancements

table of contents fully taxable equivalent net interest income for increased million  or  compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the following items a change in the mix of average earning assets resulting from deleveraging programs loans comprised of average earning assets during compared to during  changes in the composition of interest bearing liabilities resulting from deleveraging programs deposits comprised of interest bearing liabilities during compared to during  a slight increase in net earning assets as a result of the acquisition of bostonfed bancorp inc in january and ccbt financial companies  inc 
and foxborough savings bank in april and internal growth  a basis point increase in net interest rate spread  the benefit of interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion which hedged the cash flows on certain variable rate loans  which increased net interest income by million  and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits 
fully taxable equivalent interest income increased by million in as compared to as the result of an increase in the weighted average yield on earning assets from in to in  an increase of basis points 
the increase was due in part to rising short term interest rates and the effects of balance sheet deleveraging programs under which certain fixed rate securities and residential loans with extension prepayment risk were sold at a loss and the proceeds used to repay borrowings 
interest expense increased by million in compared to as a result of rising short term interest rates 
the federal reserve board raised its overnight federal funds rate five times during and eight times during  each time the rate increased by basis points or of 
the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in up from in  an increase of basis points 
year over year  the weighted average cost of deposits increased by basis points and the weighted average cost of borrowings increased by basis points 
the effect of higher funding costs was mitigated in part by the prepayment of billion of borrowings in the fourth quarter of at a pre tax loss of million due to prepayment penalties 
average interest bearing deposits increased by million or  due to acquisitions 
average demand deposits increased by million or  excluding acquisitions average demand deposits increased by million or 
average borrowings declined by billion in compared to due to balance sheet deleveraging programs  which were offset in part by borrowings assumed from acquired banks 
interest rate spread  which represents the difference between the yield earned on our interest earning assets and the rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  increased to in from in because the basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets rate was greater than the basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities primarily as a result of balance sheet deleveraging programs 
our net interest income and net interest margin also benefited from non customer interest rate swap agreements that synthetically converted variable rate assets to fixed rate assets and fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the combined effect of these interest rate swap agreements was to increase net interest income by million in and by million in during  all non customer related interest rate swaps were terminated 
at december   the deferred loss related to these terminations amounted to million  which is being amortized as a reduction of interest income over the remaining life of the hedged items

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is recorded to bring the allowance for loan and lease losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on factors discussed in the analysis and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the risk management section 

table of contents table provision for loan and lease losses the following table sets forth information regarding our provision for loan and lease losses during the periods indicated 
change combined predecessor predecessor amount percent amount percent provision for loan and lease losses we provided million and million for loan and lease losses in and  respectively 
in addition to the provisions made for on balance sheet loans and leases  we provided million for loss reserves related to off balance sheet loan commitments in this million provision is included in other noninterest expense 
the reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses in reflected our consistently strong asset quality  loss experience and migration analysis 
specifically  nonperforming assets were lower and our recent favorable loss factors replaced higher historical factors  resulting in a lower required allowance level and related provision for loan and lease losses 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was in and in the coverage ratio ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was at december   as compared to at december  see risk management below for further information on the provision for loan and lease losses  net charge offs  nonperforming assets and other factors we consider in assessing the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
although we use our best judgment in providing for losses  for the reasons discussed under the risk management section  there can be no assurance that we will not have to increase the amount of our provision for loan and lease losses in future periods

this increase in overdraft fees was partially offset by a decline in service charge income on business accounts resulting from the introduction of free business checking in acquisitions accounted for a portion of the increased number of deposit accounts  increased overdraft fees and increased retail service charges 
insurance agency commissions were flat in compared to increased renewal commissions and fee income were offset by lower new business volume 
merchant and electronic banking income represents fees and interchange income generated by the use of our atms and debit cards issued by us  along with charges to merchants for credit card transactions processed  net of third party costs directly attributable to handling these transactions 
merchant and electronic banking income increased by million or in due to increases in the volume of transactions processed and increased market share from acquisitions

table of contents income from bank owned life insurance boli increased thousand or during the cash surrender value of boli was million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was primarily comprised of amounts from acquisitions and increases in the cash surrender value of policies

standard and poors rated all such general account carriers aa or better at december  the average carrying value of boli in was million  compared to million in investment planning services income consists primarily of commissions earned from sales of third party fixed annuities  variable annuities and mutual funds 
investment planning services income was flat when compared to last year 
the pipeline of new business slowed in due to lower referral volume from the retail branch network and reduced demand for variable annuities 
net securities losses amounted to million during this included a million loss recorded in connection with the sale of billion of securities pursuant to the deleveraging program implemented by us in the first quarter of in addition  a securities loss of million was recorded in december in connection with the identification of other than temporary impairment on billion of securities to be sold in early gains and losses from the sale of securities are subject to market and economic conditions 
loans held for sale lower of cost or market adjustment amounted to a million charge during the year ended december  this amount was recorded in connection with the reclassification of million of residential real estate loans in portfolio to loans held for sale as part of the deleveraging program implemented by us in the first quarter of we retained the servicing on these loans which were sold in the change in unrealized losses on certain derivatives of million in the year ended december  resulted primarily from required changes in accounting for certain interest rate swap agreements in connection with the accounting for the toronto dominion bank transaction under the purchase method 
through february   interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million were accounted for as fair value hedges of certain fixed rate fhlb borrowings  subordinated debt and senior notes 
in addition  interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion were entered into in february and were accounted for as cash flow hedges of certain variable rate commercial loans through february  under hedge accounting rules  the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was recorded on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as an adjustment of borrowings in the case of the fair value hedges or shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of cash flow hedges 
on march   the date of completion of the toronto dominion bank transaction and resultant purchase accounting adjustments  these interest rate swap agreements were not redesignated as hedges because it was not determined that the toronto dominion bank transaction should be accounted for under the purchase method until several weeks later 
as a result  hedge accounting for these interest rate swap agreements was no longer permitted 
in march  a loss of million was recorded to reflect the change in the fair value of these swap agreements from march  to march  on april   the interest rate swap agreements related to variable rate commercial loans were redesignated as cash flow hedges  and a gain of million was recorded to reflect the change in fair value of these agreements from march  to april   these interest rate swaps were able to be redesignated as cash flow hedges because all applicable requirements of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
paragraphs and were met at the new inception date 
although no longer eligible for short cut accounting  the interest rate swap agreements related to fixed rate borrowings could not be redesignated as hedges because they did not meet the requirements to be considered highly effective 
these interest rate swap agreements were terminated on may  from march  to may  these interest rate swap agreements increased in value and a gain of million was recorded 
in addition  in september we recorded a loss of million on termination of a million  year us treasury rate lock agreement that was originated in june to hedge the forecasted issuance of million of subordinated debt 
in september  we made a decision to issue the subordinated debt in canada rather than proceed with the originally forecasted us transaction 
we decided that a canadian subordinated debt issuance was preferable to a us subordinated debt issuance for several reasons including lower funding costs  lower issuance costs via a 
table of contents private placement and a longer fixed term 
we estimate the annual cost savings to be approximately million per year 
other noninterest income increased million  or  in  primarily as a result of the following changes in the components of other noninterest income 
loan fee income increased by million in  largely due to higher volumes of interest rate swap agreements sold by us to commercial loan customers to synthetically fix the interest rate on their variable rate loans 
in connection with these transactions  we simultaneously entered into offsetting interest rate swap agreements with third party dealers 
covered call option premiums decreased by million in  this decline was related to lower volatility in interest rates and lower purchases of investment securities 
the covered call option program is managed in conjunction with the fixed income securities portfolio to provide revenue opportunities in addition to the interest income earned on the securities 
covered call option activity varies as interest rates  levels of market volatility and our strategic objectives for the fixed income securities portfolio change 
mortgage banking services income increased million in  this increase was largely due to gains on sale of portfolio loans in venture capital write downs were lower than prior year amounts  reflecting the improved performance of our investments in venture capital funds 
income on restricted stock  which represents dividends earned on required investments in the equity securities of the federal home loan bank fhlb and the federal reserve bank frb  increased by million in our investment levels in these securities are determined by regulation based on outstanding borrowings in the case of the fhlb and our equity in the case of the frb 
miscellaneous other noninterest income increased by million in this income includes fees and commissions on our official check program  cash receipts in excess of estimated cash flows on certain impaired loans which were written down to estimated fair value in connection with the toronto dominion bank transaction and fees earned from business referrals to the toronto dominion bank since march  each of these items increased over the respective amount recorded in the prior year

risk management the primary goal of our risk management program is to determine how certain existing or emerging issues in the financial services industry affect the nature and extent of the risks faced by us 
based on a periodic self evaluation  we determine key issues and develop plans and or objectives to address risk 
our board of directors and management believe that there are seven applicable risk categories  consisting of credit  interest rate  liquidity  transaction  compliance  strategic and reputation risk 
each risk category is viewed from a quantity of risk perspective high  medium or low coupled with a quality of risk management perspective 
in addition  an aggregate level of risk is assigned as a whole  as well as the direction of risk stable  increasing or decreasing 
each risk category and the overall risk level is compared to regulatory views on a regular basis and then reported to the board with an accompanying explanation as to the existence of any differences 
the risk program includes risk identification  measurement  control and monitoring 
our board of directors establishes the overall strategic direction for td banknorth 
it approves our overall risk policies and oversees our overall risk management process 
the board has established the audit committee and  through td banknorth  na  the board risk committee  to oversee key risks 
in addition  there is a management operational risk committee  which is comprised of senior officers in key business lines  which identifies and monitors key operational risks 
the operational risk committee reports on a regular basis to the board risk committee 

table of contents credit risk management general the board risk committee monitors our credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management includes centralized policies and uniform underwriting criteria for all loans 
the strategy also includes diversification on a geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit examinations and quarterly management review of large loans and loans with a deterioration of credit quality 
we maintain an internal rating system that provides a mechanism to regularly monitor the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
the rating system is intended to identify and measure the credit quality of lending relationships 
for consumer loans  we utilize standard credit scoring systems to access consumer credit risks and to price consumer products accordingly 
we strive to identify potential problem loans early  take any necessary charge offs promptly and maintain adequate reserve levels

table of contents we continue to focus on asset quality issues and to allocate significant resources to the key asset quality control functions of credit policy and administration and loan review 
the collection  workout and asset management functions focus on the reduction of nonperforming assets 
despite the ongoing focus on asset quality and relatively low levels of nonperforming assets  there can be no assurance that adverse changes in the real estate markets and economic conditions in our primary market areas will not result in higher nonperforming asset levels in the future and negatively impact our operations through higher provisions for loan losses  net charge offs  decreased accrual of interest income and increased noninterest expenses as a result of the allocation of resources to the collection and workout of nonperforming assets 
residential real estate loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when they become days past due or are in the process of foreclosure 
all closed end consumer loans days or more past due and any equity lines of credit in the process of foreclosure are placed on nonaccrual status 
consumer loans are charged off upon reaching or days past due depending on the type of loan 
we generally place all commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans and leases which are days or more past due  unless secured by sufficient cash or other assets immediately convertible to cash  on nonaccrual status 
at december   we had million of accruing loans which were days or more delinquent  as compared to million of such loans at december  we also may place loans on nonaccrual and  therefore  nonperforming status which are currently less than days past due or performing in accordance with their terms but which in our judgment are likely to present future principal and or interest repayment problems and which thus ultimately would be classified as nonperforming

table of contents during  we reclassified the portion of our allowance for credit losses related to unfunded credit commitments from the allowance for loan and lease losses to a separate liability account 
in connection with the toronto dominion bank transaction  million of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to impaired commercial loans was applied to reduce the carrying values of impaired commercial loans in accordance with the implementation of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer

these loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
these loans and delinquency trends  along with accruing loans which are days or more past due and performing loans which are less than day past due or performing in accordance on their terms which we have placed on nonaccrual status  are considered in the evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the related determination of the provision for loans and lease losses 
analysis and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level determined to be adequate by us to absorb future charge offs of loans and leases deemed uncollectable 
this allowance is increased by provisions charged to income and by recoveries on loans previously charged off 
for purposes of determining our allowance for loan and lease losses  we specifically evaluate each commercial business and commercial real estate loan which is rated substandard and has a balance in excess of thousand 
we evaluate all other loans by loan type on a pooled basis 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment and is determined based on our ongoing evaluation 
as discussed under critical accounting policies  we believe that the methods used by us in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses constitute a critical accounting policy 
although we utilize judgment in providing for losses  for the reasons discussed under critical accounting policies and credit risk management nonperforming assets  there can be no assurance that we will not have to increase the amount of our provision for loan and lease losses in future periods

asset liability management is governed by policies  goals and objectives that are adopted and reviewed by our board of directors and monitored periodically by the board risk management committee 
the board delegates responsibility for asset liability management strategies to achieve these goals and objectives to the asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of members of senior management 
senior management determines the strategic directives that guide the day to day management of our activities and interest rate risk exposure

interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings or long term value resulting from changes in interest rates and is by far the most significant non credit risk to which we are exposed 
this risk arises directly from our core lending and deposit gathering activities and is predominantly concentrated in our mortgage related assets  as well as in our non maturity deposits 
mortgage related assets typically give borrowers the option to prepay at any time without penalty 
principal cash flows that come from these assets are highly interest rate sensitive 
as interest rates fall  borrowers are more likely to pay off their existing mortgages  which results in higher cash flows that we must in turn reinvest 
replacing these higher rate mortgage assets with lower rate mortgage assets has the potential to reduce our net interest income unless we can also reduce either our wholesale or retail funding costs 
in the low interest rate environment  bank deposits can increase  especially if the market risk premium is not sufficient to adequately compensate investors 
consequently  under such circumstances  we can have even more cash to reinvest in low yielding assets 
conversely  rising rates tend to have the opposite effect on both mortgage assets and non maturity deposits 
higher rates make borrowers less likely to refinance existing debt  resulting in lower cash flows for us to reinvest 
and if the market risk premium is sufficiently high  depositors could be enticed to take additional investment risk and move deposits from banks into riskier assets  such as equity securities 
this in turn could result in less cash to invest or even require us to use wholesale funding market sources more actively 
in the case of higher interest rates  our funding sources could reprice faster than our assets and at higher rates  thereby reducing our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the degree to which future earnings or long term value is subject to interest rate risk depends on how closely the characteristics of our interest earning assets match those of our interest bearing liabilities 
in addition to directly impacting mortgage asset and deposit cash flows  interest rate changes could affect i the amount of loans originated and sold by us  ii the level and composition of deposits  iii the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans  iv the average maturity of loans and investments  v the rate of amortization of premiums paid on securities  capitalized mortgage servicing rights  deferred fees and purchase accounting adjustments  vi the fair value of our saleable assets  the amount of unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale per sfas no 
 and the resultant ability to realize gains on the sale of such securities and vii per sfas nos 
and  the fair value of derivatives carried on our balance sheet  derivative hedge effectiveness testing and the amount of ineffectiveness recognized in earnings 
assessment and measurement the overall objective of interest rate risk management is to deliver consistent net interest income growth and returns on equity over a wide range of possible interest rate environments 
to that end  management focuses on i key interest rate risk metrics and assessment of td banknorth s exposure to this risk  ii a careful review and consideration of modeling assumptions and iii asset and liability management strategies that help attain the corporate goals and objectives adopted by our board of directors 
the primary objective of interest rate risk management is to control our estimated exposure to interest rate risk within limits and guidelines established by the alco and approved by our board 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over a wide range of both short term and long term measurements 
in addition  we evaluate interest rate risk based on ongoing business risk measures  liquidation or run off measures of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and stress test measures 
ongoing measurements and runoff analysis provide management with information concerning day to day operations 
stress testing shows the impact of very extreme but lower probability events 
the combination of these measures gives management a comprehensive view of possible risks to future earnings and long term equity value 
we attempt to control interest rate risk by identifying  quantifying and  where appropriate  hedging our exposure to these risks 

table of contents net interest income sensitivity net interest income is our largest source of revenue 
net interest income sensitivity is our primary short term measurement used to assess the interest rate risk of our ongoing business 
management believes that net interest income sensitivity gives us the best perspective on how day to day decisions affect our interest rate risk profile 
to evaluate net interest income sensitivity  we subject estimated net interest income over a month period to various rate movements using a simulation model for various specified interest rate scenarios 
simulations are run monthly and include scenarios where market rates are shocked up and down  scenarios where market rates gradually change or ramp up and down and scenarios where the slope of the market yield curve changes 
our base simulation assumes that rates do not change for the next months 
the sensitivity measurement is calculated as the percentage variance of the net interest income simulations to the base simulation results 
results for the gradual ramps are compared to policy guidelines and are disclosed in the interest rate risk results below 
as indicated in table  assuming a gradual and basis point increase in interest rates starting on december   we estimate that our net interest income in the following months would decrease by and  respectively 
this is because in the event of an upward shift in rates  the simulated increase in interest income would be less than the simulated increase in interest expense because total adjustable rate interest earning assets generally will reprice less quickly than total interest bearing liabilities 
also as indicated in table  assuming a gradual and basis point decrease in interest rates starting on the same date  we estimate that our net interest income in the following months would increase by and  respectively 
these results are dependent on material assumptions such as interest rate movements  product pricing  customer behavior and forecasted transactions 
this table reflects the impact of all asset liability management actions listed below  as well as the sale of billion of mortgage backed securities as part of the balance sheet restructuring program implemented by us in connection with the acquisition of hudson in january  and the reinvestment of the proceeds in shorter duration investment securities 
table sensitivity of net interest income the following table sets forth the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income for the months following the dates indicated 
basis point basis point basis point basis point rate increase rate increase rate decrease rate decrease december  successor december  predecessor our asset liability management policy on interest rate risk simulation specifies that if market interest rates were to shift gradually up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the subsequent months should decline by less than 
all interest rate risk measures were within compliance guidelines at december  and asset liability management actions the most significant factors affecting market risk exposure of net interest income during the year ended december  were as follows changes in the shape of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curves  changes in the prepayment speeds of mortgage assets  the addition of billion of interest rate swap agreements fixing the cash flows of certain variable rate loans tied to libor or a designated prime rate  which was later terminated  as noted below  
table of contents the approximately billion deleveraging program implemented in the first quarter of  which included the sale of million of single family residential loans  billion of mortgage backed securities and million of securities of us federal agencies  the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the first quarter of  the issuance in september of can million subordinated debt us million which has a fixed rate for the first years 
simultaneous with this issuance  we synthetically converted the underlying subordinated debt into us dollars with a cross currency swap described under derivative instruments below to achieve a fixed rate of on us million for years  the sale of million of primarily fixed rate one to four family residential loans  and the termination of billion of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges on december   at a loss of million 
this loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on an after tax basis and will be amortized as a reduction of interest income over the remaining life of the hedged items 
by removing the effective caps on the rates of certain variable rate loans  this transaction significantly reduces our net interest income risk to further rate increases 
the federal reserve board continued to raise short term interest rates by increasing the federal funds target from on january  to by the end of the year 
the year us treasury yield was up approximately basis points for the year ended december   from december  mortgage rates rose with the year us treasury yield  with our year conforming single family residential mortgage rate up basis points from december  as a result  the yield curve has flattened considerably  with the spread between the day us treasury bill and five year us treasury note at only basis points at december  compared to basis points at december  table incorporates the estimated net impact of these changes  as well as planned activity  assuming various changes in interest rates 
derivative instruments purpose and benefits derivative financial instruments are important tools that we use to manage interest rate risk  and to a lesser degree  currency risk related to the canadian denominated subordinated debt issuance by td banknorth  na in september  and price risk related to restricted stock unit awards based on the price of the toronto dominion bank common stock granted by us in march the following table shows our derivative positions at december  scheduled by maturity 
table derivative positions asset liability management positions notional amount maturing fair december  successor thereafter total value cross currency swap agreement total return swap forward commitments to sell loans 
table of contents customer related positions notional amount maturing fair december  successor thereafter total value interest rate contracts receive fixed  pay variable pay fixed  receive variable foreign currency rate contracts forward contracts with customers forward contracts with dealers foreign exchange options to purchase foreign exchange options to sell rate locked loan commitments no value has been assigned to potential mortgage servicing rights related to rate locked loan commitments 
designated hedges through february   certain interest rate swap contracts were designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate borrowings  consisting of million of subordinated debt due  million of senior notes due and million of fhlb advances weighted average rate of maturing through september 
effective march   and as a result of the toronto dominion bank transaction and related purchase accounting adjustments  these swaps no longer qualified for fair value hedge accounting 
all of these interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges prior to march  were terminated on may  in june  we entered into a million year us treasury rate lock agreement expiring in july to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of subordinated debt 
the rate lock was eventually terminated in september  when a decision was made to issue the subordinated debt in canada backed by a guarantee of the toronto dominion bank rather than in the us because such an issuance would result in lower funding costs  lower issuance costs via a private placement and a longer fixed term 
we estimate the annual cost savings of this decision to be approximately million per year 
a loss of million was recognized in connection with this termination 
subsequently  td banknorth  na issued can million subordinated debt in september this debt is guaranteed by the toronto dominion bank and is described above under asset liability management actions 
simultaneously  we synthetically converted the underlying subordinated debt into us dollars with a fixed rate of for the initial year period with a cross currency swap agreement executed with td securities 
as noted above  on december   we terminated billion of interest rate swap agreements previously designated as cash flow hedges of certain variable rate loans 
in december  we entered into an equity total return swap that matures on march  this swap will return to us the change in price on  common shares of the toronto dominion bank on the new york stock exchange less the cost to carry these shares  which is equal to month libor less the toronto dominion bank quarterly dividend 
this swap hedges restricted share units tied to the price of the toronto dominion bank common shares granted under retention agreements which were entered into with eight of our executive officers in connection with the toronto dominion bank transaction and a performance based restricted share unit plan adopted pursuant thereto 

table of contents we manage the interest rate risk inherent in our mortgage banking operations by entering into forward sales contracts 
an increase in market interest rates between the time we commit to terms on a loan and the time we ultimately sell the loan in the secondary market generally will have the effect of reducing the gain or increasing the loss we record on the sale 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by entering into forward sales commitments in amounts sufficient to cover to of loans held for sale which are currently closed or are anticipated to close 
table mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges the following table summarizes the average balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale and related hedge positions during the periods indicated 
combined predecessor average residential mortgage loans held for sale average rate locked loan commitments average forward sales contracts customer related positions interest rate derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  offered to commercial borrowers through our hedging program are designated as speculative under sfas no 
however  we believe that our exposure to commercial customer derivatives is limited because these contracts are simultaneously matched at inception with an identical dealer transaction 
the commercial customer hedging program allows us to retain variable rate commercial loans while allowing the customer to synthetically fix the loan rate by entering into a variable to fixed interest rate swap 
for the year ended december   we recorded a total notional amount of million of interest rate swap agreements with commercial borrowers and an equal notional amount of dealer transactions 
it is anticipated that over time customer interest rate derivatives will reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our longer term  fixed rate commercial business and real estate loans 
the customer related positions summarized in table include both the customer and offsetting dealer transactions 
foreign exchange or market risk our earnings are not directly and materially impacted by movements in foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
virtually all transactions are denominated in the us dollar 
movements in equity prices may have an indirect but modest impact on earnings by affecting the volume of activity or the amount of fees from investment related businesses 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are contracts that we enter into as an accommodation for customers involved in international trade for the future delivery or purchase of foreign currency at a specified price 
for these creditworthy customers  we set aside a percentage of the customer s available line of credit until the foreign currency contract is settled 
foreign exchange and trade services are provided under a private label arrangement with a correspondent bank 
risks arise from the possible inability of the seller and or our customer to perform and from any resultant exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rates  limiting our exposure to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional principal or contract amounts 
liquidity our board risk management committee establishes policies and analyzes and manages liquidity to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in addition to unexpected customer demands for funds  such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand  in a timely and cost effective manner 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds 
ultimately  public confidence is generated through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
liquidity management is viewed from a long term and a short term perspective  as well as 
table of contents from an asset and liability perspective 
we monitor liquidity through a regular review of loan and deposit maturities  yield and rate scenarios and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
other factors affecting our ability to meet liquidity needs include variations in the markets served and general economic conditions 
we have various funding sources available to us on a parent only basis as well as through our banking subsidiary  as outlined below 
on a parent company only basis  our commitments and debt service requirements at december  consisted primarily of million of junior subordinated debentures and million of senior notes due may  see capital and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the principal sources of funds for us to meet parent only obligations are dividends from td banknorth  na  which are subject to regulatory limitations  income from investment securities and borrowings from public and private sources  including draws on our million unsecured line of credit which is renewable every days and  if used  carries interest at libor plus 
at december   td banknorth  na had million available for dividends that could be paid without prior regulatory approval 
in addition  the parent company had million in cash or cash equivalents at december  see also financial condition other funding sources above 
for information on restrictions on the payment of dividends by td banknorth  na  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item banking subsidiary for td banknorth  na  liquidity represents the ability to fund asset growth  accommodate deposit withdrawals and meet other contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
see table contractual obligations and commitments above 
liquidity is measured by the ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost 
many factors affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served  its asset liability mix  its reputation and credit standing in the market and general economic conditions 
in addition to traditional retail deposits  td banknorth  na has various other liquidity sources  including proceeds from maturing securities and loans  the sale of securities  asset securitizations and borrowed funds such as fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and brokered deposits 
we continually monitor and forecast our liquidity position 
there are several interdependent methods used by us for this purpose  including daily review of fed funds positions  monthly review of balance sheet changes  monthly review of liquidity ratios  periodic liquidity forecasts and periodic review of contingent funding plans 
at december   td banknorth  na had in the aggregate billion of currently accessible liquidity through collateralized borrowings or security sales 
this represented of retail deposits  as compared to a policy minimum of of deposits 
also at december   td banknorth  na had in the aggregate potentially volatile funds of billion 
these are funds that might flow out of td banknorth  na over a day period in an adverse environment 
management estimates this figure by applying adverse probabilities to its various credit sensitive and economically sensitive funding sources 
at december   the ratio of currently accessible liquidity to potentially volatile funds was  compared to a policy minimum of 
in addition to the liquidity sources discussed above  we believe that our residential and consumer loan portfolios provide a significant amount of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales or securitizations 
we believe we also have significant untapped access to the national brokered deposit market 
these sources are contemplated as secondary liquidity in our contingent funding plan 
we believe that the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements 
for additional information regarding off balance sheet risks and commitments  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to sell up to billion of debt securities  preferred stock  depository shares  common stock and warrants 
table of contents and which allows affiliated trusts to sell capital securities 
we had million of remaining authority under this shelf registration statement at december  capital we are committed to managing capital for shareholder benefit and maintaining protection for depositors and creditors 
at december  and  our shareholders equity totaled billion and billion  respectively  or and of total assets  respectively 
the billion increase in shareholders equity in was primarily attributable to the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the toronto dominion bank transaction that resulted in a billion increase to shareholders equity 
other factors attributable to the increase were our million net income in and the issuance of shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million in connection with acquisitions by us in these increases were partially offset by million in dividends to shareholders and a million net change in unrealized loss on securities available for sale 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at an average price of 
we did not repurchase any shares in in december and january  the board of directors authorized a total repurchase of up to million shares of common stock of td banknorth in the open market after the completion of the acquisition of hudson united bancorp 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require us to maintain certain ratios 
we maintain capital ratios to exceed well capitalized capital levels in accordance with capital guidelines approved by our board of directors 
our tier capital  as defined by the federal reserve board  was billion or of average assets at december   compared to billion or of average assets at december  we also are required to maintain capital ratios based on the level or our assets  as adjusted to reflect their perceived level of risk 
our regulatory capital ratios currently exceed all applicable requirements 
see note to consolidated financial statements included in item td banknorth  na is also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements 
at december   td banknorth  na was deemed to be well capitalized under the regulations of the office of the comptroller of currency of the united states and in compliance with applicable capital requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item when evaluating the issuance of long term debt at the holding company level versus receiving dividends from td banknorth  na  we first consider the regulatory capital ratios of td banknorth  na and the proforma impact of potential acquisitions on these capital ratios 
our policy is to maintain capital ratios at the bank and holding company at levels in excess of well capitalized levels specifically a tier leverage capital ratio between and compared to needed to be considered well capitalized and total risk based capital ratio of compared to needed to be considered well capitalized 
we maintain this policy so that we and td banknorth  na will be able to support changes in the composition of our assets and growth  including by acquisition 
at december   we had seven affiliated trusts which were formed for the purpose of issuing to unaffiliated parties capital securities and investing the proceeds from the sale thereof in junior subordinated debentures issued by us or companies acquired by us 
all of the proceeds from the issuance of the capital securities and the common securities issued by the trusts are invested in our junior subordinated debentures  which represent the sole assets of the trusts 
the capital securities pay cumulative cash distributions quarterly at the same rate as the junior subordinated debentures held by the trusts 
we own all of the outstanding common securities of the trusts and effectively are the guarantor of the obligations of the trusts 

table of contents table capital securities the following table provides information on each of our affiliated trusts and the outstanding capital securities of such trusts and the related junior subordinated debentures issued by us at december  junior issuance capital common subordinated stated maturity name date securities securities debentures rate date peoples heritage capital trust i banknorth capital trust i ipswich statutory trust i ccbt statutory trust i banknorth capital trust ii bfd preferred capital trust i bfd preferred capital trust ii unamortized fair value adjustment amounts include junior subordinated debentures acquired by affiliated trusts from us with the capital contributed by us in exchange for the common securities of such trusts 
junior subordinated debentures are equal to capital securities plus common securities 
at december   trust preferred securities amounted to of td banknorth inc s tier capital 
effective april   the federal reserve board adopted a final regulation which permits bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in tier capital  subject to stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
although this final regulation becomes effective on march   td banknorth inc is currently in compliance with the stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
at december  and december   our consolidated borrowings included million of subordinated notes due in and million of subordinated notes due in issued by td banknorth  na  both of which qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
banking regulators have also established guidelines as to the level of investments in boli 
these guidelines are expressed in terms of a percentage of tier capital plus loan loss reserves 
our internal guideline which is consistent with regulatory guidelines is that boli should not exceed of our tier capital plus loan loss reserves  which we monitor monthly 
the ratio of boli to tier capital plus loan loss reserves increased to at december  as compared to at december  due to boli acquired from the bostonfed acquisition 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies allowance for loan and lease losses  accounting for acquisitions and review of related goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for pension plans  accrued income taxes and accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
we consider these policies as our critical accounting policies due to the potential impact on our results of operations and the carrying 
table of contents value of certain of our assets based on any changes in judgments and assumptions required to be made by us in the application of these policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level which we believe is sufficient to cover potential charge offs on loans and leases deemed to be uncollectible based on continuous review of a variety of factors 
these factors consist of the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions  loan growth  charge off experience  delinquency trends  nonperforming loan trends  portfolio migration data and other asset quality factors 
the primary means of adjusting the level of this allowance is through provisions for loan and lease losses  which are established and charged to income on a quarterly basis 
although we use available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary because our estimates of the potential losses in our loan and lease portfolio are susceptible to change as a result of changes in the factors noted above 
any such increases would adversely affect our results of operations 
at december   our allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  and during   and our provisions for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
see also credit risk management above 
for the commercial business loans and leases and the commercial real estate loans portfolios  we formally evaluate specific commercial and commercial real estate loans rated substandard or worse in excess of thousand 
on an ongoing basis  an independent loan review department reviews classified loans to ensure the accuracy of the loan classifications 
estimated reserves for each of these credits are determined by reviewing current collateral value  financial information  cash flow  payment history and trends and other relevant facts surrounding the particular credit 
in addition  the appraisal function reviews the reasonableness of the third party appraisals related to these loans 
provisions for losses on the remaining commercial loans are based on pools of similar loans using a combination of historical loss experience and migration analysis  which considers the probability of a loan moving from one risk rating category to another over the passage of time and qualitative adjustments 
for the residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios  the range of reserves is calculated by applying historical charge off and recovery experience to the current outstanding balance in each loan category  with consideration given to loan growth over the preceding twelve months 
using the determined mid point of the range  management uses various quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the appropriate point above or below the range mid point 
this process is supported by objective factors including historical loss experience  trends in delinquency and nonperforming loans  changes in product offerings or loan terms  changes in underwriting and or collections policies  changes in management of underwriting and collection departments  and regional and national economic conditions and trends 
accounting for acquisitions and review of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of other companies  we generally record as assets on our financial statements both goodwill and identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits intangibles  non compete agreements and customer lists 
due to a change in an accounting standard  since january  we no longer amortize the amount of our goodwill through a charge to expense over the period of its expected life 
instead  we regularly evaluate whether the carrying value of our goodwill has become impaired  in which case we reduce its carrying value through a charge to our earnings 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the 
table of contents reporting unit level  and there is goodwill recorded in all reporting units 
core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the valuation techniques used by us to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
any change in the estimates which we use to determine the carrying value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of the transaction with the toronto dominion bank on march  and in accordance with the guidelines for accounting for business combinations  an additional billion of goodwill and million of additional identifiable intangible assets were created 
at december   our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets amounted to billion and million  respectively  and during  and our amortization expense amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
there was no impairment recorded in  or accounting for pension plans we use a december measurement date to determine our pension expense and related financial disclosure information 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we set the discount rate for our retirement plans by reference to investment grade bond yields 
in december  we modified our discount rate section to adopt a more detailed cash flow modeling approach consistent with the intent of sfas previously we referred to moodys aa yield for long term corporate bonds to select a discount rate 
we now look to the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index for guidance 
in developing the discount rate or rates used for our plans  we apply each plan s expected cash flow to the interest rates provided in the discount curve as of december to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
similarly  we evaluate the expected long term rate of return on the assets held in our defined benefit pension plan based on market and economic conditions  the plan s asset allocation and other factors 
as a consequence of our most recent annual review  we reduced the discount rate for all of our employee benefit plans from as of december  to as of december  our expected rate of return on our pension plan assets was for and is the same for pension expense is sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  adjusting the discount rate by basis points while holding other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the forecasted expense for our defined benefit plan by approximately million 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  adjusting the expected rate of return by basis points while holding other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the forecasted expense for our defined benefit plan by approximately thousand 
as with the computations on pension expense  cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of return on plan assets 
we have traditionally contributed the maximum tax deductible amount to our pension plan each year 
accrued income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based on the amount we expect to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued income taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
we also rely on tax opinions  recent state audits and historical experience 
although we use available information to record accrued income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws influencing our overall tax position 

table of contents accounting for derivatives and hedging activities we use various derivative financial instruments to assist in managing our interest rate  foreign currency  and equity market risks and help our customers manage their interest rate risk 
these derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
we formally document relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions 
we also assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of hedged items 
for both fair value and cash flow hedges  certain assumptions and forecasts related to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged must be documented at the inception of the hedging relationship to demonstrate that the derivative instrument will be effective in hedging the designated risk 
if these assumptions or forecasts do not accurately reflect subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument or the designated item being hedged  we might be required to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for that derivative instrument 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument must flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  which would result in greater volatility in our earnings
