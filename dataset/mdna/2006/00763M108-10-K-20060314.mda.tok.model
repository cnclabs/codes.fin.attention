item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on amo s results of operations and cash flows during each of the three years in the period ended december   and the company s financial position at that date 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of amo and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices for the eye 
we have two major product lines ophthalmic surgical and eye care 
our ophthalmic surgical product line provides medical devices for use in the cataract implant and laser vision correction markets 
in the cataract and implant market  we focus on the four key products required for cataract surgery foldable intraocular lenses  or iols  implantation systems  phacoemulsification systems and viscoelastics 
in the laser vision correction market  we market laser systems  diagnostic devices  treatment cards and microkeratomes for use in laser eye surgery 
our eye care product line provides a full range of contact lens care products for use with most types of contact lenses 
these products include single bottle  multi purpose cleaning and disinfecting solutions  hydrogen peroxide based disinfecting solutions  daily cleaners  enzymatic cleaners and contact lens rewetting drops 
in addition  we sell contact lenses in europe and asia 
we have operations in approximately countries and sell our products in approximately countries and have organized our operations into four regions americas north and south america  europe  africa and middle east  japan  and asia pacific excluding japan  but including australia and new zealand 
product rationalization and repositioning plan on october   our board of directors approved a product rationalization and repositioning plan covering the discontinuation of non strategic cataract surgical and eye care products and the elimination or redeployment of resources that support these product lines 
the plan also includes organizational changes and potential reductions in force in manufacturing  sales and marketing associated with these product lines  as well as organizational changes in research and development and other corporate functions designed to align the organization with our strategy and strategic business unit organization 
a substantial portion of expected operating cost benefits will result from reductions in force and associated annualized employee compensation of approximately million 
the plan further calls for increasing our investment in key growth opportunities  specifically our refractive implant product line and international laser vision correction business  and accelerating the implementation of productivity initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred million of pre tax charges  which included million for inventory related charges included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses for severance  relocation and other one time termination benefits of million  asset write downs of million  contractual obligations of million and accelerated productivity and brand repositioning costs of million 
we expect to incur an additional million to million of charges in the first half of  which will be recognized as the services are performed and actions occur 
the total charges that are expected to be incurred are within the range previously announced 
certain foreign jurisdictions have laws and regulations which require consultations and negotiations with works councils  labor organizations and local authorities 
the outcome of these discussions will determine  in part  the restructuring steps to be implemented and the associated cost 
therefore  the final costs of the business repositioning plan may be significantly different from our initial estimates 
acquisition of visx  incorporated on may   pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger merger agreement  dated as of november   as amended  by and among advanced medical optics  inc amo  vault merger corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of amo  and visx  incorporated visx  we completed our acquisition of visx  for total consideration of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million shares of amo common stock  the fair value of visx stock options converted to amo stock options and approximately million in cash visx acquisition 
visx products include the visx star excimer laser system  the visx wavescan system and visx treatment cards 
the visx acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our reported financial position and results of operations after may  include visx and the impact of purchase accounting 
purchase accounting applied to the visx acquisition resulted in a non cash in process research and development charge of million in the year ended december  acquisition of pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business on june   we completed the acquisition of the pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business for million in cash pfizer acquisition 
we acquired ophthalmic surgical products and certain manufacturing and research and development facilities located in uppsala  sweden  groningen  netherlands and bangalore  india 
the products acquired include the healon line of viscoelastic products used in ocular surgery  the ceeon and tecnis intraocular lenses and the baerveldt glaucoma shunt 
the pfizer acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
our reported financial position and results of operations after june  include pfizer and the impact of purchase accounting 
purchase accounting applied to the pfizer acquisition resulted in charges in the year ended december   including an in process research and development charge of million and incremental cost of sales of million from the sale of acquired inventory adjusted to fair value 
during  we also incurred other acquisition related charges totaling approximately million as we integrated the pfizer surgical ophthalmic business and eliminated duplicative functions 
separation from allergan allergan spun off its existing optical medical device business by contributing all of the assets related to the two business lines that comprise the optical medical device business to us and distributing all of our outstanding shares of common stock to its stockholders 
we had no material assets  liabilities or activities as a separate corporate entity until allergan s contribution to us of the optical medical device business 
the contribution of assets and distribution to allergan stockholders was completed on june  as a result of the spin off  we are an independent public company and allergan no longer maintains any stock ownership in us 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with allergan in connection with  among other things  transitional services  employee matters  manufacturing and tax sharing 
under the manufacturing agreement  which ended on june   allergan manufactured certain of our eye care products and vitrax viscoelastics from the date of the spin off 
we purchased these products from allergan at a price equal to allergan s fully allocated costs plus 
during  and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of product from allergan 
on an annual basis  a pricing true up calculation was performed during the first calendar quarter after the end of each year 
this true up calculation was based on the actual volume of products shipped by allergan to us during the preceding year versus the forecasted volume submitted by us that was used to calculate the invoiced prices 
during the year  we periodically reviewed the volume of purchases and accrued for estimated shortfalls  if any 
in october  we received million from allergan for the final true up calculation for the last six months of the agreement 
in march  we made a payment of million to allergan based upon the true up calculation for the year ended december  in march  we made a payment of million to allergan based upon the true up calculation for the year ended december  these payments have been recorded as an increase decrease to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the tax sharing agreement governs allergan s and our respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes for any tax period ending before  on or after the spin off 
generally  allergan is liable for all pre spin off taxes except for pre spin off taxes attributable to our business for in addition  the tax sharing agreement provides that allergan is liable for taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the spin off 
during  we realized final adjustments to accrued  pre spin off taxes attributable to our business and payable to allergan pursuant to this agreement 
these adjustments included a million benefit from the resolution of a discrete item in the third quarter of  which was recorded in the income tax provision 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer  with the exception of intraocular lenses distributed on a consignment basis  which is upon notification of implantation in a patient 
we recognize license fees and revenues from the sale of treatment cards to direct customers when we ship the treatment cards as we have no continuing obligations or involvement subsequent to shipment 
some customers finance the purchase or rental of their visx equipment directly from us over periods ranging from one to three years 
these financing agreements are classified as either rental or operating leases or sales type leases as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
under sales type leases  system revenues are recognized based on the net present value of the expected cash flow after installation to direct customers in the united states and japan or after shipment to international distributors 
under rental or operating lease arrangements  rental revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
we generally permit returns of product if such product is returned in a timely matter  in good condition  and through the normal channels of distribution 
however  we do not accept returns of treatment cards and we do not provide rights of return or exchange  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our visx product distributors 
return policies in certain international markets can be more stringent and are based on the terms of contractual agreements with the customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
to date  historical product returns have been within our estimates 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  certain allowances known and estimable at time of sale are recorded as a reduction to sales 
these items include cash discounts  allowances and rebates 
these items are reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable to the extent the customer will or is expected to reduce its payment on the related invoice amounts 
in addition  certain items such as rebates provided to customers that meet certain buying targets are paid to the customer subsequent to customer payment 
thus  such amounts are recorded as accrued liabilities 
these provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues and estimated customer inventory levels 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
to date  historical sales allowances have been within our estimates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
on a regular basis  we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence by analyzing estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
based on these evaluations  inventory balances are reduced  if necessary 
goodwill and long lived assets on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review performed during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
in a business combination  goodwill is allocated to our various reporting units  which are the same as our reportable operating segments based on relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as our operations comprise four reporting units americas  europe africa middle east  japan and asia pacific  we review the recoverability of goodwill by comparing each unit s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the reporting unit s assets exceeds its fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  we review the carrying amount of goodwill whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined such indicators are present and the review indicates goodwill will not be fully recoverable  based upon discounted estimated cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to implied fair value 
in the second quarters of  and  we performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill  and no impairment was indicated based on these tests 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairment to our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if required  an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
our income tax returns in several locations are being examined by the local taxation authorities 
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest  if any  have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation for option grants to employees and members of the board of directors using the intrinsic value method 
the fair value of each option grant for determining the pro forma disclosure impact of stock based compensation expense is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions 
these assumptions consist of expected dividend yield  expected volatility  expected life  and risk free interest rate 
if the assumptions used to calculate the value of each option grant do not properly reflect future activity  the weighted average fair value of our grants could be impacted 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will measure stock based compensation using the fair value method under revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  issued by the financial accounting standards board in december see new accounting standards section for further discussion 
under the incentive compensation plan as approved in the special meeting of stockholders on may   we granted restricted stock to employees and members of the board of directors during the year ended december  restricted stock awards are valued based on the market price of a share of non restricted stock on the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the restricted stock 
acquired in process research and development costs to acquire in process research and development ipr d projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred 
the fair value of ipr d projects and technologies is estimated based upon management s assumptions such as projected regulatory approval dates  estimated future revenues and cost of goods sold of the products under development and expected sales and marketing costs 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the estimated results 
comparing fiscal years ended december   and net sales 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by geographic region and major product line 
year ended december  in thousands united states ophthalmic surgical eye care total united states americas  excluding united states ophthalmic surgical eye care total americas  excluding united states europe africa middle east ophthalmic surgical eye care total europe africa middle east japan ophthalmic surgical eye care total japan asia pacific ophthalmic surgical eye care total asia pacific total net sales ophthalmic surgical eye care total net sales us international excluding us we organize our operations into four regions the americas  which includes north and south america  europe africa middle east  japan and asia pacific 
net sales for increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in was primarily the result of sales of products acquired in the visx acquisition in and the full year impact of the purchase of the pfizer ophthalmic surgical business in june  as well as increased sales of technologically advanced products due to continued market acceptance of the products 
net sales of acquired visx products approximated million in net sales of acquired pfizer ophthalmic surgical products were million in  compared to net sales of million in these increases were partially offset by declines in our older non promoted and discontinued products and eye care sales in japan and europe 
the unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations on net sales was million in the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations during the first nine months of were offset by a negative impact in the fourth quarter of our net sales and earnings in future periods may be negatively impacted during times of a strengthening us dollar 
the us information is presented separately as it is our headquarters country  and us sales represented   and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
additionally  sales in japan represented   and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
no other country  or any single customer  generated over of total net sales in any of these years 
net sales in the americas  including the united states  increased million  or  in from and such increase comprised a million increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products and a million increase in sales of eye care products 
the increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products was primarily the result of sales of products acquired in the visx and pfizer acquisitions 
net sales of acquired visx products were million in net sales of acquired pfizer products  including the healon family of viscoelastics and tecnis intraocular lenses  were million in  compared to million in the increase in sales of eye care products was primarily due to an increase in sales of complete branded products 
net sales in the americas include the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of million in net sales in europe africa middle east increased million  or  in from and such increase comprised a million increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products and a million decrease in sales of eye care products 
net sales of acquired visx products were million in the increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products includes million in sales of acquired pfizer products  including the healon family of viscoelastics and tecnis intraocular lenses  compared to million in the increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products also reflected an increase in net sales of phacoemulsification products 
the decrease in sales of eye care products was primarily due to a decrease in sales of hydrogen peroxide based products due to the overall market decline as the migration of single bottle cleaning regimens continues 
net sales in europe africa middle east include the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of million primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro in net sales in japan decreased million  or  in from and such decrease comprised a million decrease in sales of eye care products  partially offset by a million increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products 
the decrease in sales of eye care products was primarily due to decreases in sales of multipurpose solutions and hydrogen peroxide based products resulting from the contracting market for these products in japan 
we are seeing continuing shrinkage of the market for hydrogen peroxide based products as contact lens wearers gravitate increasingly to frequent replacement lenses that use more convenient multipurpose solutions 
we also saw decreased sales of multipurpose products due to rapid growth of daily disposable lenses and our decision to discontinue our non core products 
the increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products includes million in sales of acquired pfizer products in  compared to million in net sales of acquired visx products were million in net sales in japan include the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of million resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen in net sales in asia pacific increased million  or  in from and such increase comprised a million increase in sales of ophthalmic surgical products and a million increase in sales of eye care products

net sales in asia pacific include the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of million in global sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased million  or  in from sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased primarily due to sales of products acquired in the visx acquisition and increased sales of our branded promoted products  including the healon family of viscoelastics  tecnis and rezoom intraocular lenses  and increased sales of sensar intraocular lenses and phacoemulsification products 
ophthalmic surgical product sales were negatively impacted by decreased sales of non promoted older technology intraocular lenses and non promoted viscoelastics 
we believe that global sales of ophthalmic surgical products will continue to grow due to sales of acquired products  including the healon family of viscoelastics  the tecnis intraocular lens  the baerveldt glaucoma shunt  the visx star systems and treatment cards  and increased sales of our sensar and rezoom intraocular lenses 
we expect the growth to be partially offset by decreased sales of our older intraocular lenses as we continue our strategy of promoting our higher technology intraocular lenses  tecnis  sensar and rezoom 
net sales of acquired visx products were million in net sales of acquired pfizer products were million in  compared to million in the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations during the first nine months of were offset by a negative impact in the fourth quarter of global sales of our eye care products decreased million  or  in from sales of our eye care products decreased primarily due to decreased sales of hydrogen peroxide based products  principally in europe and japan  where the migration to single bottle cleaning regimens continues  and decreased sales of multipurpose solutions in japan due to an increase in the market for daily disposable lenses 
the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations during the first nine months of were offset by a negative impact in the fourth quarter of as part of our product rationalization and repositioning plan to maximize our competitive advantage as the global refractive leader and improve the global penetration of our core cataract  refractive and eye care brands  we have discontinued a variety of non strategic cataract surgical and eye care products that lack critical revenue mass  have experienced steadily declining sales trends and or have generated relatively unattractive margins 
we expect the growth of our promoted products to offset the revenue decline related to these discontinued products

our gross margin percentage increased as a percentage of net sales by percentage points to in from in the increase in gross margin was largely driven by sales growth in the higher margin healon family of viscoelastics and sales of acquired visx products 
gross profit for included a fourth quarter charge of million  or a percentage point impact on gross margin percentage  for inventory provisions associated with our product rationalization and business repositioning plan 
gross profit for was also negatively impacted by a million charge  or a percentage point impact  associated with manufacturing productivity improvements and integration related costs 
our gross margin percentage decreased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in gross profit for included a charge of million  or percentage point impact on gross margin percentage  for manufacturing profit capitalized in inventory and expensed related to the pfizer acquisition 
in addition  pre production costs incurred at our manufacturing facility in madrid  spain  costs incurred for expansion of our manufacturing facility in hangzhou  china  and higher costs of product supplied by allergan contributed to the gross margin percentage decrease  which was partially offset by sales growth in the higher margin complete branded line of eye care products and sales of the healon family of viscoelastics

research and development 
research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales in increased slightly as compared to and as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant in as compared to our research and development strategy is to develop proprietary products for vision correction that are safe and effective and address unmet needs 
during  we obtained fda approval and launched the rezoom multifocal intraocular lens and the tecnis acrylic lens  a wavefront designed monofocal intraocular lens 
we are currently focusing on new advancements that build on our tecnis  healon and whitestar technology  corneal and lens based solutions to presbyopia and dry eye products 
in process research and development 
in  we incurred an in process research and development ipr d charge of million related to the visx acquisition 
this charge represented the estimated fair value of projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company recorded million of this amount in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of the additional charge in the third quarter of resulted primarily from the completion of the ipr d valuation 
the fair value assigned to ipr d comprised the following projects high myopia for customvue million  excimer laser improvements million and presbyopia million 
the fair value of these projects was determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach 
net cash flows attributable to these projects were discounted to their present values at a rate commensurate with the perceived risk  which for these projects ranged from to percent 
high myopia for customvue was forecasted to be approved for sale in the us in late fda approval was received in september a procedure to treat presbyopia is forecasted to be approved for sale in the us in late additional research and development expenses needed prior to expected fda approval for these procedures are expected to range from million to million 
this range represents management s best estimate as to the additional r d expenses required to bring these products to market in the us additional research and development expenses in the range of million to million represent management s best estimate as to the additional r d expenses to bring excimer laser system improvements to market 
forecasted discounted cash flows for each product once launched include estimates for normal sustaining engineering and maintenance r d 
these projects are currently on track for the expected approval dates 
however  the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining the necessary approvals 
we can provide no assurance that the approvals will be received on this schedule or at all 
in  we incurred an ipr d charge of million related to the pfizer acquisition

the estimated fair value assigned to ipr d comprised the following projects tecnis monofocal million and tecnis multifocal million 
the estimated fair value of these ipr d projects was estimated by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using a discount rate of 
regulatory approval for the tecnis monofocal in japan was expected and received in we also estimate that the tecnis multifocal will receive its pma in the us in  with approval in japan in additional research and development expenses in the range of million to million for the tecnis multifocal represents our best estimate as to the additional research and development expenses to bring these products to market 
these projects are currently on track for the expected approval dates

business repositioning costs 
on october   our board of directors approved a product rationalization and repositioning plan covering the discontinuation of non strategic cataract surgical and eye care products and the elimination or redeployment of resources that support these product lines 
the plan also includes organizational changes and potential reductions in force in manufacturing  sales and marketing associated with these product lines  as well as organizational changes in research and development and other corporate functions designed to align the organization with our strategy and strategic business unit organization 
the plan further calls for increasing our investment in key growth opportunities  specifically our refractive implant product line and international laser vision correction business  and accelerating the implementation of productivity initiatives 
we incurred million in pre tax charges during the fourth quarter of which included million for inventory related charges included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses for severance  relocation and other one time termination benefits of million  asset write downs of million  contractual obligations of million and accelerated productivity and brand repositioning costs of million 
we expect to incur an additional million to million in charges in the first half of these costs will be recognized as the services are performed and actions occur 
operating income 
operating income loss was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating loss was negatively impacted by an aggregate million in charges primarily related to the visx acquisition and our product rationalization and business repositioning initiatives as discussed above 
non operating expense 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense in includes a pro rata write off of debt issuance costs of million primarily associated with the termination of the term loan  partially offset by the recognition of a realized gain on interest rate swaps of million 
in  interest expense included a net charge of million comprised of a charge of million for the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount and one time commitment fees net of a net realized gain on interest rate swaps of million  all associated with the prepayment of the japan term loan in june  consummation of the june tender offer for million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  the exchange of million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes and partial prepayment of the million june term loan 
interest expense in included a net charge of million comprised of a charge of million for the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount net of a net realized gain on interest rate swaps of million associated with the prepayment of a term loan in june  the consummation of the modified dutch auction tender offer for million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinate notes in july and the repurchase of an additional million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinate notes in september we anticipate interest expense to decrease in relative to due to the anticipated overall reduction in average borrowings outstanding during as well as the higher percentage of our relatively low fixed rate convertible debt versus our variable rate debt 
the anticipated increase in interest rates throughout will slightly offset these benefits 
we recorded an unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments of million  million and million in  and respectively

we have provided a tax provision at on the remaining income  which was partially offset by tax benefits from the american jobs creation act of and final adjustments with allergan  which are discussed below 
income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates applicable to such income and we have provided for us federal income taxes and anticipated foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
the american jobs creation act of was signed into law in october  which allows companies to elect to repatriate cash into the united states in at a special  temporary effective tax rate of percent 
based on our evaluation of the amount of foreign earnings that we have elected to treat under this special provision  the income tax benefit of the repatriation was million in the lower tax rate in reflects continuing implementation of our long term tax strategies  as well as final adjustments of previously accrued pre spin off taxes attributable to our business in and payable to allergan pursuant to a pre spin tax sharing agreement 
these adjustments included a million benefit from the resolution of a discrete item in the third quarter  which was recorded in the income tax provision 
we believe our future effective income tax rate may vary depending on our mix of domestic and international taxable income or loss and the various tax and treasury methodologies that we implement  including our policy regarding repatriation of future accumulated foreign earnings 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million even though we had a pre tax loss of million

liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  adequate lines of credit  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements  and we expect to do so in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in operating cash flow decreased in compared to due to increases in cash paid for income taxes  timing of accounts payable payments and inventory buildup  partially offset by the favorable impact of the visx acquisition and timing of accounts receivable collections 
the inventory buildup was due in part to bridging stock related to the recent transfer of eye care manufacturing from allergan and the increases in the size and scope of our global manufacturing network 
operating cash flow decreased in compared to primarily as a result of early debt extinguishment costs paid in cash and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the additional sales of acquired pfizer products and the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the additional costs incurred in operating the acquired pfizer manufacturing facilities in uppsala  sweden  groningen  netherlands and bangalore  india and expansion of our eye care manufacturing facilities in madrid  spain and hangzhou  china in preparation for our transition of eye care manufacturing from allergan 
additionally  in february  we received approximately million from allergan 
this payment ended a dispute between us and allergan regarding the ownership of a certain value added tax receivable due from france 
as part of the settlement with allergan  we were responsible for paying penalties and expenses associated with the receivable  which aggregated less than million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures are primarily comprised of expenditures to upgrade our viscoelastics manufacturing facility in uppsala  sweden 
the amount includes million net cash paid primarily for the acquisition of visx 
the capital expenditures are primarily comprised of expansion of our manufacturing facilities in preparation for the transition away from the allergan manufacturing agreement  expenditures at the acquired manufacturing facilities and construction of research and development facilities at our leased headquarters 
the amount also includes the million pfizer acquisition purchase price  which was financed with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes and a million term loan 
in november  we completed the purchase of an existing manufacturing facility in madrid  spain 
we financed the approximately million purchase of this facility with available cash and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to the uppsala  sweden manufacturing facility during the next year in order to separate the facility from existing pfizer operations 
expenditures for demonstration demo and bundled equipment  primarily phacoemulsification and microkeratome surgical equipment  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we maintain demo and bundled equipment to facilitate future sales of similar equipment and related products to our customers 
expenditures for capitalized internal use software were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the software expenditures were due to acquisition related integrations and improvements to support common global technology platforms 
we capitalize internal use software costs after technical feasibility has been established 
in  we expect to invest approximately million to million in property  plant and equipment  demo and bundled equipment  and capitalized software as part of the overall expansion of our business 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which comprised million of proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes  million of borrowings primarily under the senior revolving credit facility  million of proceeds from the sale of stock to employees and million proceeds received after settling an interest rate swap agreement  reduced by million of debt repayments and million of financing related costs

net cash used in financing activities was million in  which primarily comprised million of long term debt borrowings and million from the sale of stock to employees reduced by long term debt repayments of million and financing related costs of million 
in january  we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to provide for an increase of million in the revolving loan commitments and an additional million in term loan commitments 
on may   we and certain of our subsidiaries  as guarantors thereunder  entered into an amendment to provide for an additional increase of million in the revolving loan commitments under the senior credit facility  which amounts were made available to us to finance  in part  our acquisition of visx  and are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes subject to satisfaction of certain conditions 
this amendment also provides for termination of million of existing term loan commitment 
the amendment increased the revolving loan commitments to million 
the maturity of the senior credit facility on june  remains unchanged 
on may   we borrowed approximately million under the senior revolving credit facility to fund the cash portion of the visx acquisition 
in june  we repaid approximately million of revolver borrowings with acquired visx cash 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
approximately million of the revolving credit facility was reserved to support letters of credit issued on our behalf for normal operating purposes and we had approximately million undrawn and available revolving loan commitments 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under a short term loan from bank of ireland to our subsidiary  amo ireland 
this loan was supported by a million letter of credit which was part of the million of letters of credit noted previously 
this loan was paid in its entirety on february  and is no longer available for borrowing 
our senior credit facility provides that we will maintain certain financial and operating covenants which include  among other provisions  maintaining specific leverage and coverage ratios 
certain covenants under the senior credit facility may limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the senior credit facility prohibits dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  our senior credit facility is secured by a first priority perfected lien on  and pledge of  all of the combined company s present and future property and assets subject to certain exclusions  of the stock of the domestic subsidiaries  of the stock of the foreign subsidiaries and all present and future intercompany debts 
in the second quarter of  we exchanged  shares of common stock for million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a privately negotiated transaction 
in the fourth quarter of  we exchanged  shares of common stock and approximately million in cash for million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in privately negotiated transactions 
on july   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes due july  interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable on january and july of each year  commencing on january  the senior subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount of the senior subordinated notes conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the senior subordinated notes may be converted  at the option of the holders  into cash or under certain circumstances  cash and shares of our common stock at any time on or prior to the trading day preceding june  we have elected to satisfy in cash the conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
on july   we paid off the balance of our term loan  including approximately million of principal and approximately million of accrued interest  using the net proceeds from the convertible senior subordinated notes and existing cash 
as a result of the repayment  the term loan is no longer available for borrowing 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from some of our non us subsidiaries may result in additional tax costs 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund ordinary business operations 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and existing cash and equivalents  will provide sufficient resources to fund the expected capital expenditures  and to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
we are partially dependent upon the reimbursement policies of government and private health insurance companies 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation and competitive pricing  are continuing in many countries where we do business 
as a result of these changes  the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
while we have been unaware of significant price resistance resulting from the trend toward cost containment  changes in reimbursement policies and other reimbursement methodologies and payment levels could have an adverse effect on our pricing flexibility 
additionally  the current trend among us hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power 
the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing  although we are unable to estimate the potential impact at this time 
inflation 
although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation may cause upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately   and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states  and a significant portion of our cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
therefore  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars as a result of changing currency exchange rates 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales was a million decrease in  million and million increase in and  respectively 
the sales increases in and were due primarily to a strengthening of the japanese yen and euro versus the us dollar 
contractual obligations 
the following represents a list of our material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years total long term debt  principal amount a cash commitments for interest expense operating lease obligations it services other purchase obligations  primarily purchases of inventory and capital equipment a excludes short term borrowings of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we routinely monitor the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not expect to enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  there can be no assurance that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor  from an accounting and economic perspective  our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions  when applicable  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk 
at december   our debt comprises primarily domestic borrowings of which million is fixed rate debt and million is variable rate debt 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
this interest rate swap qualified as a cash flow hedge and would have matured in july in april  we terminated the interest rate swap 
upon termination  we received approximately million and included the related gain of approximately million  which includes the accrued but unpaid net amount between us and the swap counterparty  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the second quarter of as a result of the repayment of the term loan in july  the gain on the interest rate swap of million was fully recognized as a reduction to the interest expense in the third quarter of at december   there are no outstanding interest rate swaps 
in  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted the interest rate on million of the senior subordinated notes from a fixed to a floating rate and converted the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps had maturity dates beginning in and qualified as either fair value or cash flow hedges 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement qualifying as a cash flow hedge were recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent such changes were effective and as long as the cash flow hedge requirements were met 
in may and october  we realized the value of the interest rate swaps qualifying as fair value hedges 
we received an aggregate of approximately million  of which approximately million represented the net settlement of the accrued but unpaid amount between us and the swap counterparties 
the remaining amount of approximately million was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior subordinated notes as a premium and was being amortized over the remaining life of the senior subordinated notes 
at december   after recognizing a pro rata portion of the gain upon repurchase of a portion of the senior subordinated notes  the unamortized gain on these interest rate swaps was million 
as a result of the june repurchase of the remaining senior subordinated notes  the remaining unamortized gain on the interest rate swaps was fully recognized 
in may  we terminated the interest rate swap qualifying as a cash flow hedge 
we paid approximately million and included the related loss of approximately million as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result of the prepayment of the term loan in june  the loss on the interest rate swap was fully recognized as interest expense

overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated net sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
we may enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we do not enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for trading purpose 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the japanese yen and the euro 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to protect the value of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were economically designed to offset the changes in the revaluation of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these forward contracts are denominated in currencies which represent material exposures 
the changes in the fair value of foreign currency option and forward contracts are recorded through earnings as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments while any realized gains or losses on expired contracts are recorded through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
any premium cost of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the options
