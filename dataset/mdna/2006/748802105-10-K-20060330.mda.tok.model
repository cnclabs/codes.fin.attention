item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview newspaper industry considerations our financial performance reflects  to a meaningful extent  conditions in the newspaper industry 
we believe that our customers spending for capital investment  and therefore  demand for our equipment  are affected by fluctuations in advertising revenue and newsprint cost 
specifically  we believe the growth in our business is somewhat reflective of the growth in newspaper advertising revenues  offset by any increases in newsprint costs 
similarly  we believe that a decline in advertising revenues generally will adversely affect capital equipment spending by newspapers and  as a result  will adversely affect our financial performance 
on a longer term basis  we believe that capital investment patterns have been  and will continue to be  affected by reduction in newspaper circulation and industry consolidation 
according to published reports  newspaper circulation in the united states has decreased by an average of approximately each year from to according to statistics from the audit bureau of circulation  daily newspaper circulation declined for the six months ending september  compared to the same period in the sharp decline in may have reflected a correction of circulation statistics that certain newspapers had reportedly misstated in recent years 
nevertheless  we expect the trend of decreasing circulation to continue as newspapers continue to compete for advertising revenue with other media including the internet  direct mail  television and radio 
while reduced circulation could negatively affect demand for our products  we believe the consolidation of newspaper ownership in recent years has had a positive impact on our business 
in many cases  when large newspaper and media groups have acquired small newspapers and newspaper chains  the acquiring groups centralize the production and distribution of multiple newspapers located in a geographic area to one or a few sites 
the operation of centralized production and distribution facilities typically require the purchase of additional automated equipment 
therefore  consolidation could enhance demand for our products 
based on published financial reports and discussions with our customers  we believe that major newspaper chains generally derive over of their revenues from advertising 
statistics obtained from the newspaper association of america naa indicate that newspaper advertising revenue increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  representing a growth rate than is significantly lower than historical rates 
although recently published reports by analysts indicate the expectation of a modest improvement in  management believes that the trend of lower than historical increases in advertising revenue will continue into  mostly due to competition for advertising dollars by other media 
nevertheless  statistics available from naa indicate that  in which we believe are the most recent statistics available  us newspaper advertising revenue amounted to billion  continuing to rank newspapers second behind direct mail billion and ahead of broadcast television billion in the allocation of advertising dollars 
despite published reports of significant advertising revenue gains achieved by the internet  such revenues remain well below traditional media  amounting to billion in based on public filings of financial reports of many newspaper chains  newsprint represents a significant operating expense for newspaper publishers 
according to published reports  newsprint prices increased steadily during while published reports indicated that newsprint prices are expected to rise again in  publishers are attempting to offset the newsprint price increase by reducing their consumption as they move to smaller web widths and lighter newsprint weight 
accordingly  management expects that the increase in newsprint prices will have only a moderate affect on capital spending demands of newspaper publishers in our booked orders totaled  compared to  in approximately  of the booked orders were generated by newstec following its acquisition by us in august the larger volume of orders received in are partly due to demand for our recently introduced quipp packman packaging system 
additionally we believe that our customers accelerated placing orders in december to avoid an announced price increase scheduled for january  we have previously disclosed our acquisition strategy to enhance our position in the post press newspaper industry and in markets that will provide reasonable diversification 
with the acquisition of newstec in august  we expect to benefit from a more complete product offering  expanded new product development capabilities  and increased depth of management talent 
we will continue to seek acquisitions in the post press newspaper market and other markets that will provide reasonable diversification 
effect of contract terms on cash generation  revenue recognition most of our sales are made on a contract basis 
a typical sales contract requires a customer to pay for its purchase in installments as follows due at the time of the order  due days prior to shipment  due days prior to shipment  due upon installation and due upon acceptance 
contract payment terms vary for some orders and may be based on our achievement of agreed upon milestones 
while cash is collected throughout the order process  revenue is recognized only when all significant contract obligations are satisfied and collection of outstanding receivables are reasonably assured in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the time required to complete installation and the receipt of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
we expect to ship all orders in our december  backlog within months 
results of operations vs 
net sales of the  in net sales  we generated  from our new inserter product line acquired with the purchase of newstec in august the balance of the net sales totaling  decreased  compared to net sales of  the decrease was due mostly to lower sales volume of manufactured products including stackers  bottomwrappers and conveyor equipment  offset in part by an increase in oem and installation revenue 
the higher volume of oem and installation revenue was due in part to the recognition of approximately  in revenue relating to a complex system order that was manufactured and shipped to our customer in and sales to foreign customers were  in compared to  in most of our foreign sales are made to customers located in countries where equipment specifications are similar to those in the u 
s  principally newspapers in canada  central america and south america 
because opportunities to sell our equipment overseas are not consistent  sales to foreign customers fluctuate from year to year 
gross profit of the  gross profit in   was generated by our newly acquired inserter product line 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales amounted to on the newly acquired product line following the acquisition in august the gross profit percentage was adversely affected by low manufacturing volumes at our walpole  massachusetts facility  resulting in unfavorable overhead absorption 
due to the low volume of inserter orders scheduled to ship from august to december  we accelerated the relocation of our newly acquired inserter operations from massachusetts to our miami  florida facility and closed the walpole facility 
the relocation was completed by march  the profit margin percentage for our newly acquired inserter product line was also adversely affected by the purchase accounting write up of inventory on the date of acquisition 
in other words  the inventory was written up to fair value on the date that we acquired newstec 
the purchase accounting adjustment resulted in increased cost of sales by approximately  upon recognition of the related revenue 
the balance of our gross profit was  a decrease of  compared to gross profit of  for the corresponding period in gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in from in  mostly due to an improved sales mix resulting from lower volume of complex system projects in compared to we generally expect margins on complex systems projects to be lower than margins on discrete product sales due to competitive pricing pressures  system complexity and additional customization requirements 
in addition  cost of sales in reflected the rework of a gripper conveyor system that was later returned by the customer 
the improved gross profit margin was partially offset by a nominal profit earned on revenue of approximately  for a complex system project recognized during the first quarter of the order for this system was negotiated in when our market was just beginning to show signs of recovery 
we expected lower margins on this order due not only to the factors described above  but also because it included a high content of equipment manufactured by others 
additionally  in  our manufacturing plant in miami was shut down for eleven days following hurricanes katrina and wilma  resulting in added facilities and property maintenance costs coupled with production start up inefficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses of the  in selling  general and administrative expenses for   was incurred by our acquired operations in walpole  massachusetts 
the balance of our selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to  a decrease of  as compared to  for during the third quarter  we settled a matter with the export import bank of the united states exim bank related to a dispute arising from the sale of equipment to a foreign customer in the settlement with the exim bank was less than the cost estimated and accrued  and  as a result  we recorded a  reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  due to lower sales volume  we incurred lower variable selling costs including commissions and warranty expense 
the reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses was offset in part by higher expenses related to compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
research and development research and development expenses for were  a decrease of  as compared to  in in  we continued to develop and test our in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities and commenced development of new controls for some of our equipment 
in  we focused much of our research and development efforts on our new in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities 
additionally  we expended research and development resources to redesign our gripper conveyor to enhance the performance of the product in certain applications  and completed the software for the quipp packman packaging system 
in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the development of the quipp packman packaging system 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in royalty income relating to our patented automatic cart loading system technology used by another supplier of post press material handling equipment decreased to  in compared to  during the same period in interest income decreased to  in from  in our interest income was lower in due to lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale after we expended approximately  for newstec  partially offset by increases in interest rates 
in addition  we recognized interest income in related to repayment of a note from an international customer who previously was delinquent in making payment 
interest expense was greater in primarily due to amortization of loan costs associated with our line of credit 
income tax benefit expense income taxes for were reduced by  in the third quarter 
the reduction was due to an adjustment in current and deferred state tax liabilities as a result of settlements of tax obligations with several states for amounts that were less than estimated and accrued 
results of operations vs 
net sales net sales for were  an increase of  from net sales of  most of the increase is due to higher sales volume of core products including stackers  bottomwrappers and conveyor equipment 
the greater net sales are due mostly to the higher volume of orders booked in the second half of and the resulting strong backlog entering into additionally  in we recognized net sales of approximately  from our recently introduced quipp packman packaging system 
sales to foreign customers were  in compared to  in most of our foreign sales presently are made to newspapers in canada where equipment specifications are similar to those in the us sales to foreign customers fluctuate from year to year as opportunities to sell our equipment outside the united states arise 
gross profit gross profit for was  an increase of  from gross profit of  for the corresponding period in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is mainly due to the production and installation of complex systems 
in general  we expected margins to be lower on these projects due to competitive pricing pressures  system complexity and additional customization requirements 
nevertheless  we incurred higher than expected costs on complex systems  including custom software development costs for systems integration  additional production and installation costs on newer products for which we had limited experience  including an in line inserter system and waste handling systems  and rework costs for a gripper conveyor system that was subsequently returned by the customer 
our gripper conveyor has been redesigned to enhance its performance in certain applications 
costs related to the redesign of the gripper conveyor were charged to research and development 
additionally  as a result of slow incoming orders during the third quarter in  our overhead absorption was negatively affected by a one week plant shutdown and shortened work weeks for production personnel  coupled with a shutdown for two days due to hurricane conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  for we incurred higher variable selling and administrative costs such as commission and warranty expense due to improved net sales 
additionally  we incurred higher test equipment expenses due to a greater number of prospective customers evaluating our equipment as we recently introduced the quipp packman packaging system 
also  we incurred an increase in selling  general and administrative costs from expenses associated with compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of selling  general and administrative costs in included costs related to professional fees associated with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan and a special meeting of shareholders held in response to the demand of a shareholder 
research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  in in  we devoted much of our research and development resources to our new in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities 
in addition  we expended research and development resources to redesign our gripper conveyor to enhance the performance of the product in certain applications  and we completed the software for the quipp packman packaging system 
for the same period in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the development of the quipp packman packaging system 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in interest income increased to  from  mostly due to the collection of the final installment of an outstanding note receivable from an international customer 
all principal and interest payments on the note receivable had previously been applied only to the principal balance due to uncertainties regarding collectability of the note 
interest relating to the note was recognized upon receipt of the final installment 
additionally  we received  of royalty income relating to our patented automatic cart loading system technology used by another supplier of post press material handling equipment 
we received  of royalty income during the same period in liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  our cash generation has been more than sufficient to support our operations 
while our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale decreased by  at december  compared to the same date in the previous year  the decrease relates to approximately  expended to purchase newstec offset in part by the collection of receivables in the first quarter of in connection with the sale of a large and complex order that required an extended period of time to design  manufacture and install 
on march   we entered into a line of credit agreement with merrill lynch business financial services  inc under the terms of the agreement  we can borrow up to  subject to a limit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings are secured by all accounts receivable  inventory  intangibles and contract rights as well as securities with value of no less than  interest is payable monthly at a rate equal to the one month libor rate plus 
the agreement expires on april  and is subject to renewal in accordance with terms specified in the agreement 
as of the date of this report  we have not drawn on the line of credit 
our long term debt consists primarily of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of the following table provides information relating to certain of our material contractual obligations at december  payments due by period more contractual obligations total year years years than years employment agreements    building lease     purchase commitments   auto loan    industrial revenue bonds    on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december  the reduction in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulted from approximately  expended to purchase newstec  offset in part by the reduction of inventory and receivables 
working capital at december  was  a decrease of  from  at december  the reduction in working capital is due mostly to the purchase of newstec 
as noted in the overview section above  we may effect strategic acquisitions to enhance our position in the newspaper post press market or provide reasonable market diversification 
if any acquisition is effected  it may require a significant cash investment and additional short term or long term financing arrangements 
nevertheless  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with our line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has discussed the application of these estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue from contracts that include multiple element arrangements  such as a sale of standard equipment and basic installation services  is recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue on standard equipment is recognized upon delivery in accordance with contractual terms  net of discounts 
the fair value of installation services is deferred until the installation is completed 
management reviews objective evidence such as prices charged when each element is sold separately and selling prices on similar elements sold by competitors in making judgment as to the fair value for each element of the contract 
revenue from long term complex system arrangements  such as a sale of complex equipment  controls and software  is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue recognition is measured by units delivered 
on such contracts  management makes judgments regarding costs and profitability estimates measuring progress toward completion 
these judgments are subject to some degree of uncertainty  and unanticipated efforts necessary to complete a complex system could adversely affect operating results in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
nevertheless  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed our expectations  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
warranty reserves we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have generally been within our expectations and the provisions established  future returns or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
additionally  we do not have extensive warranty claims experience with recently introduced products or newstec products 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we estimated the value of the acquired intangibles assets 
because the value of these assets is not certain  there is a degree of subjectivity in allocating fair value to the assets 
the determination of fair value of certain of the assets can have an impact on amortization expense  because the useful lives of such assets vary from years to years 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets periodically 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgments with respect to value  revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we determined that goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired in however  if acquired products fail to achieve estimated volume and price levels  market conditions unfavorably change  or other significant estimates are not realized  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
to ensure safety and liquidity  we only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations
