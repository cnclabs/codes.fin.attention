item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net long lived assets  including goodwill  amounted to million as of december  recent developments on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of creative designs international  ltd

as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million for which no allowance has been provided since  in the opinion of management  realization of the future benefit is probable 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act created a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain international earnings 
the deduction was available to corporations during the tax year that includes october  or in the immediately subsequent tax year 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate million in foreign earnings  which was completed in december the federal and state income tax expense related to this repatriation was approximately million

product recall costs there were no product recall costs in in the second quarter of  we accrued a million charge for the recall of one of our products  and in the third quarter of  we recorded a credit of million for the recovery of recall costs from one of our third party factories 
the remaining component of the product recall costs is as follows in thousands accrued balance accrued balance december  accrual actual december  product recall costs profit from video game joint venture 
profit from joint venture increased by million in due to the joint venture having lower unit sales at lower wholesale prices of its two vehicle combat games of the five games released in compared to releasing all new titles with higher unit sales at higher wholesale prices in addition to having higher sales of carryover titles in new releases typically generate higher unit sales resulting in higher overall sales as compared to carryover titles 
profit from the joint venture contributed significantly to our pre tax profit  representing of pre tax income in and in we expect to continue to receive a preferred return over the remaining term of the license agreement ending december   although we cannot predict with certainty what levels of return will be achieved and  in any case  we anticipate substantial fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed to us from year to year

in making this determination  management believes it considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence 

table of contents quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry 
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for the years indicated 
the seasonality of our business is reflected in this quarterly presentation

table of contents recent accounting standards we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees 
as required by our existing stock plans  stock options are granted at  or above  the fair value of our stock  and  accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations 
we record compensation expense related to other stock based awards  such as restricted stock grants  over the period the award vests 
issued in december  sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and sfas statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements  and requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective for us beginning as of january  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
while we cannot estimate the level of share based payments to be issued in the future  based on the stock options that are currently outstanding  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will result in a charge to operations in of approximately million

operating activities provided net cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in net cash was provided primarily by net income of million  non cash charges and changes in working capital 
our cash position was improved by accounts receivable turnover as measured by days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreasing from approximately days as of december  to approximately days as of december  primarily due to a shift in sales from domestic sales origin to fob china  which carry shorter payment terms  a shift in domestic sales to customers with shorter payment terms and overall improved collection efforts and results

cash interest is payable at an annual rate of of the principal amount at issuance  from the issue date to june   payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  after june   interest will accrue on the outstanding notes until maturity 
at maturity  we will redeem the notes at their accreted principal amount  which will be equal to  per  principal amount at issuance  unless redeemed or converted earlier 
we may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part beginning on june   at of their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  payable in cash

any repurchases at june  and june  may be paid in cash  in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 

table of contents we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we intend to finance our long term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations and cash and cash equivalents 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our operating results 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong and united kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk in june  we issued convertible senior notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum  which remain outstanding as of december  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 

table of contents foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and in the united kingdom 
sales are made by these operations on fob china or hong kong terms and are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and operating expenses made in the united kingdom are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the british pound or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the british pound gave rise to the other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet at december  the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or british pound
