item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary surface transportation highlights and challenges operating results csx follows a week fiscal reporting calendar 
this fiscal calendar allows every quarter to consistently end on a friday and to be of equal duration weeks 
however  in order to maintain this type of reporting calendar  every sixth or seventh year depending on the gregorian calendar and when leap year falls  an extra week will be included in one quarter a week quarter and  therefore  the full year will have weeks 
fiscal included weeks while fiscal year had weeks 
all comparisons below utilize these respective years reported results 
revenue surface transportation s revenue in increased by or million to a record billion while volume decreased by  or  units 
a portion of this volume decrease was due to the additional week included in fiscal year revenue per unit increased by  or  of which approximately was due to continued pricing efforts and was due to the company s fuel surcharge program and traffic mix 
revenue increased across all commodities 
a strong industrial economy  coupled with a shortage of rail  truck and barge capacity allowed for substantial price increases within all merchandise groups 
while north american automotive production was relatively flat compared to the prior year  automotive revenue and revenue per unit benefited from contractual price escalations and higher fuel surcharges recoveries 
coal volumes and revenue improved significantly due to both increased electrical generation by csxt served utilities and price increases 
the overall competitive position of intermodal improved compared to the trucking industry due to shortage of truck capacity and higher fuel prices creating a stronger pricing environment for intermodal services

nm not meaningful fuel costs and fuel surcharge program fuel expenses increased to million in  net of million of fuel hedging benefits  due principally to the rising price per gallon of diesel fuel 
fuel hedging activity had a million favorable impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended december  the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  including benefits from csx s fuel hedging program  was in versus in fuel cost recovery programs are commonly used within the transportation industry 
when the cost of fuel exceeds certain thresholds  csx shares a portion of the increase with its customers through its fuel surcharge program 
in  approximately and of csx s revenue was subject to fuel surcharges and cost escalation clauses which include a fuel element  respectively 
as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are executed  csx is increasing the number of contracts which include fuel surcharge mechanisms 
operations as illustrated in the table below  key service measures show mixed results in average train velocity  system dwell and recrew performance declined  while on time train originations improved compared to the prior year 
cars on line remained essentially flat  indicating that csxt s network remained relatively fluid through the company s surface transportation businesses remained focused on producing continuous improvement through several key initiatives 
in  csxt instituted a new network operating plan called the one plan  which defines csxt s scheduled train network and is designed to improve service reliability and efficiency 
although anticipated benefits have not been realized on a sustained 
table of contents basis  csxt believes the one plan benefits will be attained and remains committed to this initiative 
efforts are ongoing to improve plan execution and to refine the operating plan to reflect changing traffic volumes  operating capabilities  and service requirements 
csxt is investing to ensure that adequate resources are in place to achieve higher levels of plan execution 
csxt acquired additional locomotives and started implementing a new locomotive plan in late locomotive availability and reliability are critical to plan execution 
csxt also hired and trained approximately  train and engine employees to keep pace with high attrition rates  particularly conductors and engineers 
finally  a two year program to expand capacity in key corridors commenced in this expanded capacity will accommodate future growth  improve service reliability and improve efficiency on the targeted corridors 
hurricane katrina  which struck the gulf coast in late august  had a significant impact on operations in the latter part of approximately miles of csxt s infrastructure was destroyed by the storm  effectively severing csxt s route to and from the new orleans gateway 
csxt continued service to customers outside of the storm affected area by rerouting rail traffic through alternative western gateways  including east st 
louis  il  memphis  tn  birmingham  al  mobile  al  and montgomery  al 
rerouted traffic added volume to busy corridors and resulted in additional network congestion  which adversely affected overall train velocity and system dwell 
service to local businesses on the gulf coast has been restored and previously rerouted merchandise trains have returned to the new orleans gateway 
operations should be normalized to pre hurricane conditions by the end of the first quarter of a description of the corresponding financial statement implications is presented below under the caption hurricane katrina

debt repurchase in june  csx repurchased billion of its publicly traded notes 
the consideration paid for these notes totaled billion  including a pretax charge of million for costs to repurchase the debt which primarily reflected the market value above original issue value

during  csx improved its overall financial position by reducing debt balances from billion at december  to billion as of december  
table of contents corresponding interest expense benefits associated with lower outstanding debt helped offset rising variable interest rates 
see note debt and credit agreements 
free cash flow free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulation g 
management believes  however  that free cash flow is important in evaluating its financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings 
free cash flow is calculated by taking cash provided by operating activities less property additions  other investing activities  and dividends paid plus conrail free cash flow and proceeds from sale of businesses 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles free cash flow non gaap measure to cash provided by operating activities gaap measure fiscal years ended december  december  dollars in millions free cash flow a add deduct items from consolidated cash flow statements short term investments net b dividends paid net cash used in investing activities c add deduct items not included in consolidated free cash flow conrail free cash flow d other deposits e net cash provided by operating activities a free cash flow as of december  includes net cash proceeds net of taxes paid from the international terminals disposition of million and net debt repurchase costs of million 
b short term investments net represents the net source or use of cash resulting from sales and purchases of short term investments included in the investing section of the consolidated cash flow statements 
c net cash used in investing activities includes property additions offset by net cash proceeds before taxes paid from the international terminals disposition of million and other investing items 
d conrail free cash flow represents csx s economic interest which is not consolidated in the csx amounts 
e other deposits are not included in the company s free cash flow as these deposits represent assets that are set aside for certain future debt payments 
expectations revenue during  csx expects revenue growth  based in part on continuance of the robust pricing environment experienced in in addition  the company expects volume increases of 
longer term  csx expects average annual revenue growth of over the next five years due to 
table of contents continued strong transportation demand  the company s emphasis on price  and volume growth 
lower contributory traffic will continue to be re priced or replaced by longer haul  more profitable business 
the amount of any revenue and volume increase will depend on several factors economy favorable economic conditions are expected to continue based on the forecasts for key economic indicators such as the gross domestic product  industrial production and overall import levels 
generally  the company s revenue is fairly diversified and a large portion is relatively insensitive to significant fluctuations in the general economy 
changes  however  in the macroeconomic environment can impact overall revenue growth 
operational performance service is expected to improve with more consistent execution of the network operating plan  which should result in improved average velocity and more reliable service 
consequently  additional volume may be captured as freight car availability increases due to improved asset utilization and reduced transit times 
fuel prices because of the fuel surcharge program and cost escalation clauses in long term contracts  which include a fuel element  a portion of the company s revenue varies with the price of fuel 
in  csx suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program and fuel surcharges became the primary vehicle through which csx manages fuel price volatility 
consequently  csx anticipates increases in estimated fuel expenses to approach million in  depending on fluctuations in fuel prices 
operations csxt expects key operating measurements to improve in versus the prior year as the initiatives mentioned previously gain momentum  and the emphasis on plan execution continues 
management believes current resource plans are adequate to handle anticipated business levels and to keep the network fluid 
csxt plans to hire approximately  new train and engine employees  which include locomotive engineers and conductors  to offset anticipated attrition 
in addition  csxt will acquire new high horsepower locomotives in planned capacity and infrastructure investments will also support improved service reliability and volume growth as they are completed throughout the year 
capital investments the company continues to invest in its rail infrastructure  locomotives  freight cars and technology to accommodate safe  efficient and reliable train operations 
in anticipation of future volume growth in key corridors  the company plans to make strategic infrastructure investments as profitability targets are met 
investments include locomotives mentioned previously  track and terminal infrastructure expansion such as the southeastern corridor between chicago and florida and the river line from albany to new york city 
investments in the southeastern corridor are intended  among other things  to support western coal sourcing from the colorado  illinois and powder river basins  consumer goods shipments from west coast ports and merchandise and automobile shipments 
investments in the river line are designed to increase long term capacity for the i corridor between chicago and new york 
as a result of these investments and the ongoing needs of the business  the company expects capital spending of approximately billion in and between billion and billion in  excluding the impact of hurricane katrina 
free cash flow csx will continue to focus on free cash flow in  with a target of approximately million  including approximately million in anticipated insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina 

table of contents risk factors enterprise risk management in the provision of transportation services  the company must identify  manage and mitigate the inherent business risks that are an integral component of the company s business activities 
financial risk  legal  regulatory  and compliance issues  operational risk  and workforce planning are primary risks to the company s business 
in  the company began implementation of a formal enterprise risk management erm program in order to identify  quantify  monitor  and potentially mitigate these risks 
erm is a systematic and ongoing process used to help recognize and manage the critical risks that could impact the company 
erm assists management s allocation of financial resources and mitigation efforts and enhances risk oversight by the board of directors with oversight by the board or board committees  management is responsible for the development and implementation of risk mitigation policies and directing day to day risk management 
the following important risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company s forward looking statements 
competition the company experiences competition in the form of pricing  service  reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area  and to a less significant extent  barges  ships and pipelines 
transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources 
the company could be negatively impacted if the scope and quality of these alternative methods of transportation materially increase  or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunities for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions 
operations and workforce planning in an environment of continued high demand for rail services  csxt has experienced some network difficulties  including congestion and reduced velocity on its rail system 
in addition  changes in demographics  training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel  could each have a negative impact on csxt s ability to meet demand for rail service 
to meet these challenges  csxt started implementation of the new network operating plan referred to as the one plan  acquired additional locomotives  started implementing a new locomotive plan  and is hiring and training significant numbers of employees to keep pace with high attrition rates 
in  the company also commenced a two year program to expand capacity in key corridors 
though these steps have been taken  csxt cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address the operational issues 
the company also cannot be sure that it will not experience other difficulties related to network capacity  dramatic and unplanned increases in demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups  or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
employees and labor union relationships csxt considers relations with its unions and union employees generally to be good 
most of csxt s employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the bargaining agreements contain a moratorium clause that precludes serving new bargaining demands until a certain date 
generally speaking  these agreements are bargained nationally by the national railway labor conference  so all bargaining on agreement changes 
table of contents begins at the same time 
the round of bargaining that started in was recently concluded when agreements were reached with all of the unions 
most of the moratoriums negotiated in the round have expired and in november the parties were free under the collective bargaining agreements to serve new bargaining demands and start a new round of national bargaining 
the current status of negotiations is that csxt and the other railroads participating in national bargaining are in mediation with eight unions  are bargaining with four other unions and have not started bargaining with one union 
the railroads had asked the national mediation board for a release from mediation with respect to seven of the eight unions in mediation  but now have informed the national mediation board that they are voluntarily withdrawing that request pending a decision in the lawsuit brought by the united transportation union which challenges certain aspects of the railroads bargaining demands 
the outcome of the round of negotiations is uncertain at this time 
in the rail industry  negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages 
the agreements reached in the round of bargaining will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
the parties are not permitted to either strike or lockout until the railway labor act s lengthy procedures which include mediation  cooling off periods  and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted 
environmental laws and regulation the company s operations are subject to wide ranging federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to water  the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials  and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
the company generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials in its current operations  and it has done so in its former operations 
in certain circumstances  environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties  leased properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors  as well as to properties currently owned and used by the company 
environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation 
the company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated  or is strictly liable under  environmental laws or regulations  and such violations can result in the company s incurring fines  penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination 
although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long term liabilities for known future environmental costs  it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing  and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known  unknown or future environmental contamination 
fuel costs fuel costs represent a significant expense of the company s surface transportation operations 
fuel prices can vary significantly from period to period and significant increases may have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
furthermore  fuel prices and supply are influenced considerably by international political and economic circumstances 
a fuel surcharge recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers 
this program has historically permitted the company s surface transportation businesses to recover a significant portion of increased fuel costs 
despite the fuel surcharge program  the company could be negatively impacted if a fuel supply shortage were to arise  whether due to opec or other production restrictions  lower refinery outputs  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  and any subsequent price increases could further increase the potential impact 

table of contents future acts of terrorism or war terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred in the united states in september  in spain in march  or in england in july  and any government response thereto or war may adversely affect results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the company s rail lines and physical plant may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war  which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in addition  insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 
regulation and legislation the company is subject to various regulatory jurisdictions  including the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of dot and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic  health  safety  labor  environmental  tax  legal and other matters 
legislation passed by congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues  costs and profitability of the company s business 
moreover  the company could be negatively affected by failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  congressional efforts to reduce or eliminate funding for amtrak  if successful  could result in significant costs to csxt  including  but not limited to loss of revenue from trackage rights  uncertainty relating to operating agreements  loss of other contractual rights  such as indemnification  adverse network implications  such as potential coordination with numerous state commuter rail agencies  and increased payments into the railroad retirement system to supplement lost contributions from amtrak and its employees 
in response to the heightened threat of terrorism in the wake of the september  attacks  federal  state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry  including rules and regulations that affect the transportation of hazardous materials 
for instance  the district of columbia enacted legislation that prohibits rail carriers  including csxt  from transporting certain hazardous materials through the district 
csxt  supported by the united states  is currently challenging the validity of this legislation in the federal courts 
although csxt and the federal government have secured favorable rulings from the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the stb  legal proceedings continue  and the ultimate outcome is uncertain 
the extent to which other governmental bodies will ultimately take similar or related steps is also uncertain 
the company could be negatively impacted by any legislation  regulations  or rules enacted by federal  state or local governmental bodies relating to security issues that affect rail and intermodal transportation 
safety the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents  including derailments 
the company is also subject to exposure to occupational injury claims 
while the company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety  the company cannot ensure that it will not experience any material property damage or personal injury or occupational claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
additionally  the company cannot ensure that existing claims will not suffer adverse development not currently reflected in reserve estimates  as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company s control 
the company engages outside parties to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and personal injury claims  and believes that it is adequately reserved to cover all potential claims 
final amounts determined to be due  however  on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

table of contents severe weather the company may face severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences  including floods  fires  hurricanes and earthquakes which may cause significant disruptions to the company s operations  and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues

operating revenue csx categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business merchandise  automotive and coal  coke and iron ore 
overall revenue increased million  or  to billion in from billion in merchandise all merchandise markets experienced revenue growth primarily driven by yield improvement efforts and the company s fuel surcharge program 
overall merchandise revenue grew to a record billion while revenue per unit also achieved record levels increasing 
volume declined due to several factors including an additional week included in the fiscal year ended december   impacts of hurricane katrina and shedding of low margin traffic 
food and consumer experienced volume growth due to a continued shift of traffic previously handled by trucks to rail and the acquisition of newly finished railcars to other shippers 
despite strong soybean and corn harvests and increased export demand for grain  volume in agricultural products was flat due to declines in processed products such as flour  sweeteners  and vegetable oils 
emerging markets volumes and revenue were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in shipments of high revenue per unit military traffic 
while metals volumes decreased by  the pricing environment remained very favorable and resulted in the highest revenue per unit growth within merchandise at 
forest products also experienced high revenue per unit increases because of both a favorable pricing environment and a favorable mix shift from short haul low margin traffic towards longer haul more profitable traffic 
in addition to production disruption from both hurricanes katrina and rita  chemical volumes were negatively impacted by high natural gas prices and generally high raw materials inventories 
phosphate and fertilizer volumes were down due to high international inventories of phosphates during the first half of the year and several csx served plant curtailments 
table of contents or closures during both the chemicals and phosphate and fertilizer groups experienced high revenue per unit increases of and  respectively 
automotive overall volume was down as north american light vehicle production was flat compared to the prior year 
however  vehicle production for the big was unfavorable  including permanent closures of three general motors plants served by the company 
growth in new shipments from the newly opened hyundai plant in montgomery  al continued to partially offset these declines 
revenue per unit grew on strong yield management and increases in fuel surcharge rates and coverage resulting in record revenue per unit levels 
revenue per unit gains more than offset volume weakness and drove overall revenue growth of compared to the prior year 
coal  coke iron ore revenues increased by to a record billion due to both strong volume growth of  and revenue per unit improvements of driven by a favorable pricing environment and the company s fuel surcharge program

all markets showed year over year revenue improvement due to pricing  yield management strategies and the company s fuel surcharge program 
all markets  except agricultural products  experienced increased volumes 
metals realized the most improvement  with revenue growth on volume growth 
strong demand existed across all steel commodity lines as steel production and mill utilization rates were at high levels 
forest products revenue grew on volume growth as a result of strength in panel and lumber markets driven by strong residential construction 
food and consumer revenues grew on volume growth 
food and consumer and forest products volumes were favorable year over year primarily due to the week fiscal reporting calendar in chemicals revenue grew on volume growth driven by strong customer demand and a rebound in us chemical exports 
emerging markets revenues grew on volume growth  largely driven by strength in aggregates  cement  lime and fly ash 
new industrial development is helping serve off rail markets

additionally  due to the adoption of sfas as discussed below  depreciation expense has been decreased and materials  supplies and other expense increased to account for the discontinuance of the accrual of cross tie removal as a component of depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased million or compared to the prior year primarily attributable to assets received as a result of the conrail spin off transaction 
the rail segment had property additions of approximately billion  but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of sfas in conjunction with the group life method of accounting for asset costs  csxt historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation  which is not permitted under sfas the effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase materials  supplies and other expense

operating income increased to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a improvement 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease in cash is primarily due to the net effect of total consolidated debt repaid of billion see debt repurchase below offset by the net cash proceeds from the sale of csx s international terminals business of billion 
debt repurchase in june  csx repurchased billion of its publicly traded notes 
the total consideration paid for these notes totaled billion  which includes a pretax charge of million for costs to repurchase the debt which primarily reflects the market value above original issue value 
csx used cash proceeds from the disposition of csx s international terminals business to finance this repurchase 
during  csx improved its overall financial position by reducing debt balances from billion at december  to billion as of december  as a result of the debt repurchase  csx expects interest expense savings of approximately million per year

dividends csx paid million  million  and million in dividends in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in is a result of the company increasing dividends by  in the fourth quarter  from cents to cents per share 
working capital the company s working capital at december  was a deficit of million  compared to a deficit of million at december   primarily driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments combined with the absence of net assets from csx s former international terminals business 
a working capital deficit is not unusual for the company and other railroads and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations arising from legal  tax and other regulatory rulings 
credit facilities csx has a billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in may and a million day unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in may the facilities were entered into in may and may  respectively  on terms substantially similar to the facilities they replaced 
generally  these facilities may be used for general corporate purposes  to support csx s commercial paper  and for working capital 
neither of the credit facilities was drawn on as of december  commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers 
in  csx paid approximately million for total fees associated with the undrawn facility 
these credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating libor based rates  plus a spread  depending upon csx s senior unsecured debt ratings 
at december   csx was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facilities 
stock repurchases the board of directors has authorized csx to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time in an amount up to approximately million in any fiscal year 
pursuant to this authority  csx intends to purchase shares of csx common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
credit ratings as of december   csx s long term unsecured debt obligations were rated bbb and baa by standard and poor s and moody s investor service  respectively

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting 
table of contents period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
consistent with the prior year  significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas casualty  environmental and legal reserves pension and postretirement medical plan accounting depreciation policies for assets under the group life method income taxes these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis 
casualty  environmental and legal reserves casualty casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims 
currently  none of these claims are covered by insurance since no individual claim value is expected to exceed the company s self insured retention amount 
personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies sfas 
to the extent the value of an individual claim were to exceed the self insured retention amount  csx would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries 
most of the claims are related to csxt unless otherwise noted 
personal injury csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of csxt s claims and cases 
an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi annually and is reviewed by management 
the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of csxt s personal injury claims 
this methodology is based largely on csxt s historical claims and settlement activity 
actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury  costs of medical treatments  and uncertainties in litigation 
while the final outcome of casualty related matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things  the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded  it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
however  should a number of these items occur in the same period  they could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
occupational occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place  such as asbestos  solvents  and diesel fuel  or alleged physical injuries  such as repetitive stress injuries  carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss 
occupational asbestos the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace 
the heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were phased out in the s  according to rail industry statistics 
however  other types of exposures  including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials  continued until it was substantially eliminated by 
table of contents asbestos claim filings against the company have been inconsistent 
accordingly  while the company had concluded that a probable loss had occurred  prior to it did not believe it could estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the lack of experience with such claims and the lack of detailed employment records for the population of exposed employees 
claim filings increased and when they continued into  the company concluded that an estimate for incurred but not reported ibnr asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded 
currently  there is recurring pending legislation regarding the establishment of an asbestos liability trust fund 
the impact to the company of this pending legislation is unknown at this time 
provision for asbestos change in estimate in  the company changed its estimate of asbestos reserves to include an estimate of ibnr claims and retained a third party specialist who has extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist in this estimate 
the analysis is performed by the specialist semi annually and is reviewed by management 
the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated ibnr claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years 
seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 
the company  with the assistance of the third party specialist  first determined its potentially exposed population from which it was able to derive the estimated number of ibnr claims 
the estimated average cost per claim was then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data 
based on the assessment  in september the company recorded an undiscounted million pre tax charge for unasserted asbestos claims 
key elements of the assessment included the following an estimate was computed using a ratio of company employee data to national employment for select years during the period the company used railroad industry historical census data because it did not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees 
the projected incidence of disease was estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed 
an estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease non malignant  cancer and mesothelioma was computed using the company s average historical claim filing rates for a year calibration period ie the years management felt were representative of future filing rates 
an estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim was computed using the company s historical average dismissal rates observed for two years 
an estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease was computed using the company s historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incident observed during a year time period 
from these assumptions  the company projected the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim 
historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type 
historical dismissal rates  which represent claims that are closed without payment  were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company 
finally  the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 
asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include large batches of claims solicited by law firms 
to reflect these factors  csx used a year calibration period during its initial assessment 
table of contents because the company believed it would be most representative of its future claim experience 
in addition  for non malignant claims  the number of future claims to be filed against csx declines at a rate consistent with both mortality and age as there is a decreasing probability of filing claims as the population ages 
csx believes the average claim values by type of disease from the historical year period were most representative of future claim values 
provision for asbestos change in estimate in  management had no changes in estimate for asbestos liabilities 
in  management updated their assessment of the unasserted liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists  which resulted in recognition of a million favorable change in estimate associated with asbestos liabilities 
during and  asbestos related disease claims filed against csx dropped substantially  particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms 
in  the company received a significant number of filings 
the company believes the number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new  more restrictive venue law took effect in west virginia in mid as a result  management reassessed the calibration period to a year average  excluding the surge in claims originating in west virginia 
management believes this calibration period provides the best estimate of future filing rates 
the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve 
a increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 
the company  with the assistance of the third party specialist  obtains semi annual updates of the study 
the company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments 
more periodic updates to the study will occur if trends necessitate a change 
other occupational provision for other occupational change in estimate in  the company changed its estimate of occupational reserves to include an estimate of ibnr claims for other occupational injuries as well as asbestos as noted above 
the company engaged a third party specialist to assist in projecting the number of other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years 
based on this analysis  the company established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable other occupational injury liabilities 
in  the company recorded an undiscounted million pre tax charge for ibnr other occupational claims for similar reasons as asbestos discussed above 
similar to the asbestos liability estimation process  the key elements of the assessment included the following an estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases was calculated by projecting active versus retired work force from to using a growth rate projection for overall railroad employment made by the railroad retirement board in its june report 
an estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury  employee type  and active versus retired employee was computed using the company s average historical claim filing rates for the year calibration period for all diseases except hearing loss 
because the filing rate for hearing loss claims has been decreasing since  the latest year filing rate was viewed as representative 
these calibration periods are the time periods which management felt were representative of future filing rates 
an estimate was made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired csx population each year 

table of contents an estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury was computed using the company s historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of injury observed during a year time period 
provision for other occupational change in estimate in  management had no changes in estimate for other occupational liabilities 
during  csx experienced an unfavorable trend in settlement values for repetitive stress and other injuries  which resulted in the recognition of a million unfavorable change in estimate associated with these liabilities 
in connection with the semi annual updates of the study  the company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments 
more periodic updates to the study will occur if trends necessitate a change 
the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve 
a increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims 
summary the amounts recorded by the company for asbestos and other occupational liabilities are based upon currently known information and judgments based upon that information 
projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of claims  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational litigation or legislation in the united states  could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected 
while the final outcome of casualty related matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other items the meritorious legal defenses available and the liabilities that have been recorded  it is the opinion of management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
however  should a number of these items occur in the same period  they could have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
environmental the company is a party to various proceedings  including administrative and judicial proceedings  involving private parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at approximately environmentally impaired sites  many of which are  or may be  subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  or similar state statutes 
a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that csx  or its predecessors  sent hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal 
in addition  some of the company s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in releases of various regulated materials onto the property 
therefore  the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law  as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  which could be substantial 
in  the company assumed million of conrail environmental liabilities  due to the conrail spin off transaction 

table of contents at least once each quarter  csxt reviews its role with respect to each such location  giving consideration to a number of factors  including type of cleanup required  nature of csxt s alleged connection to the location eg  generator of waste sent to the site  or owner or operator of the site  extent of csxt s alleged connection eg  volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors  accuracy and strength of evidence connecting csxt to the location  and number  connection  and financial viability of other named and unnamed prp s at the location 
csxt management estimates its environmental liabilities using guidance from statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
each site is periodically evaluated and the liability is adjusted to the most recent estimates made by management 
based on the review process  the company has recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental costs with respect to such sites 
environmental costs are charged to expense when they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the company s estimate of unasserted claims  which the company believes to be immaterial 
the liability includes future costs for all sites where the company s obligation is deemed probable  and where such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries 
currently  the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities  if any  on some sites until completion of future environmental studies 
in addition  latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure  the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated 
based upon information currently available  however  the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations  and that the ultimate liability for these matters  if any  will not materially affect its overall results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
legal in accordance with sfas  an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued  disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 
the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities twice quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above 
the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings  newly discovered or developed evidence  or changes in laws  regulations  and evidentiary standards 
pension and postretirement medical plan accounting the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  principally for salaried  management personnel 
the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement 
in addition to the defined benefit pension 
table of contents plans  the company sponsors one medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full time  salaried  management employees hired prior to january   upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met 
the postretirement medical plans are contributory partially funded by retirees  with retiree contributions adjusted annually 
the life insurance plan is non contributory 
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in sfas  employers accounting for pensions sfas  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the following long term rate of return of plan assets  discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense  salary scale inflation rates  health care cost trend rates  and other assumptions 
these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year 
as permitted by sfas  the company has elected to use a plan measurement date of september to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as it provides for more timely analysis 
the company engages independent  external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects as of the beginning of the plan year 
the company reviews the discount  salary scale inflation  and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 
because the company reduced its expected long term rate of return on assets in  management does not anticipate revising this assumption for the next several years to maintain consistency with market cycles 
long term rate of return on plan assets the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in estimating that rate  the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is used in conjunction with the market related value of assets to compute the expected return on assets 
the company s expected long term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds 
management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets 
as this assumption is long term  it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting 
discount rates discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense 
assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which the pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
it is appropriate in estimating those rates to look to available information about rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could be used to effect settlement of the obligation 
in making those estimates  employers may also look to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the 
table of contents plans expected benefit payments 
csx uses a different discount rate for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans 
each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates 
if interest rates generally decline or rise  the assumed discount rates will change 
salary scale inflation rates salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company 
the company reviews recent merit increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in assessment of salary scale inflation rates 
health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs  representing increases in total plan costs  which include claims and administrative fee cost components 
the current assumed health care cost trend rate is for medicare eligible participants and for non medicare eligible participants and is expected to increase slightly before decreasing gradually until reaching in based upon current actuarial projections 
other assumptions the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates  turnover  and retirement age 
these assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by management 
estimated pension and postretirement expense as a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year  net periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs for are expected to be approximately million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively in currently  there is proposed legislation regarding pension plan funding requirements 
if the proposed legislation is passed  pension plan funding requirements will be increased 
the impact to the company of this proposed legislation is unknown at this time

the company determined that its medical 
table of contents plan s prescription drug benefit will qualify as actuarially equivalent to medicare part d based upon a review by the plan s health and welfare actuary of the plan s benefit compared with the benefit that would be paid under medicare part d 
the reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the act was approximately million as of december  see note employee benefit plans 
the company has applied for the tax free federal reimbursement of total prescription drug claims from to  paid after january  combining the financial implications of both cash receipts and lower tax deductible business expenses resulting from the subsidy  the company expects after tax cash flow savings of approximately million for fiscal year additionally  projected postretirement benefit expenses for fiscal year were reduced by approximately million due to the act 
depreciation policies for assets under the group life method csxt accounts for its rail assets  including main line track  locomotives and freight cars  using the group life method 
the group life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole 
under the group life method  the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by the performance of periodic life studies and management s assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties 
these studies  called life studies  are conducted by a third party expert  analyzed by the company s management and approved by the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation 
life studies for equipment assets are completed every three years  whereas road and track life studies are completed every six years as required by the stb 
changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and thus the company s results of operations 
factors taken into account during the life study include statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property  evaluation of current operations  evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules  previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use  expected net salvage expected to be received upon retirement  and comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies 
the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study 
any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 
although recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes  these modifications have not significantly affected the company s annual depreciation expense 
in  the company completed life studies for all of its rail  equipment and track assets  resulting in an increase in the average useful lives of equipment and track assets  while decreasing the average useful lives of many roadway assets 
the combination of these adjustments increased depreciation expense by million in with a decrease of approximately million in no life studies were required or completed during assets depreciated under the group life method comprise of the company s total fixed assets of billion on a net basis at december  the company s depreciation expense for the year ended december  amounted to million 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the average life of all group life assets would result in an million increase or decrease to the company s annual depreciation expense 

table of contents income taxes management uses factors such as applicable law  current information and past experience with similar issues in computing its income tax expense 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented 
the company does not anticipate any material change in the methodology or assumptions used in determining the company s income tax expense 
the company files a consolidated federal income tax return  which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries 
examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through federal income tax returns for through currently are under examination 
management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of csx 
an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items  however  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year

csx s rail unit average annual fuel consumption is approximately million gallons 
a one cent change in the price per gallon  excluding gallons hedged  of fuel would affect fuel expense by approximately million annually 
csx is exposed to loss in the event of non performance by any counter party to the interest rate swap or fuel hedging agreements
