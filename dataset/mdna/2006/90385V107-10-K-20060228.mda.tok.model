item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
currently  our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems 
we are increasing our revenue related to the sale of other subsystems  including chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies and process modules 
our primary customers are semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
historically the majority of semiconductor equipment manufacturers were vertically integrated 
however  as they place greater emphasis on their core competencies  process development and innovation  they rely more heavily on outsourcing the design  development and manufacturing of many of the subsystems that comprise the semiconductor manufacturing equipment they produce 
as the requirements they place on their subsystem suppliers increase and the scope of the subsystems they outsource expands  semiconductor equipment manufacturers seek to consolidate their supplier relationships into a reduced number of integrated solution providers 
we provide our customers complete subsystem solutions that combine our expertise in design  test  component characterization and highly flexible manufacturing operations with quality control and financial stability 
this combination helps us drive down total manufacturing costs  reduce design to delivery cycle times and maintain high quality standards for our customers 
we believe these characteristics  as well as our standing as a leading supplier of gas delivery systems  place us in a strong position to benefit from the growing demand for subsystem outsourcing 
a substantial majority of our products consists of gas delivery systems 
our other subsystems  related to semiconductor manufacturing equipment  include chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies and process modules 
we operate clean room manufacturing facilities in menlo park  california  austin  texas  tualatin  oregon  and shanghai  china 
we have in the past considered and will continue to consider acquisitions that will enable us to expand our geographic presence  secure new customers and diversify into complementary products and markets as well as broaden our technological capabilities in semiconductor capital equipment manufacturing 
fp ultra clean  llc  an entity controlled by francisco partners  llc  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to a stockholders agreement with fp ultra clean  llc  our board of directors may not take certain significant actions without the approval of fp ultra clean  llc as long as it owns at least of our outstanding common stock  including mergers  acquisitions or sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business  the issuance of securities and the incurrence or refinancing of indebtedness in excess of million 
cyclical business our business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  with recurring periods of over supply of semiconductor products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment used to manufacture semiconductors 
during these periods  we have experienced significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products 
our sales were million in  million in and million in in periods where supply exceeds demand for semiconductor capital equipment  we generally experience significant reductions in customer orders for our products 
sharp decreases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment may lead our customers to cancel forecasted orders  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production  each of which may negatively impact our gross profit as we may be unable to reduce costs quickly and may be required to hold inventory longer than anticipated 
in periods where demand for semiconductor capital equipment exceeds supply  we typically need to quickly increase our production of gas delivery and other subsystems  requiring us to order additional inventory  effectively manage our component supply chain  hire additional employees and expand  if necessary  our manufacturing capacity 

table of contents outsourcing need we generate a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of gas delivery systems as well as a growing portion from other subsystems 
the success of our business and our ability to generate future sales depends on oems continuing to outsource the manufacturing of gas delivery systems and other subsystems for their semiconductor capital equipment 
most of the largest oems have already outsourced a significant portion of their gas delivery systems 
if oems do not continue to outsource gas delivery systems for their capital equipment  our revenue would be reduced  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to obtain additional business as oems outsource their production of gas delivery and other subsystems  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
customer and geographic concentration a relatively small number of oem customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc 
as a group accounted for of our sales in  of our sales in  of sales in because of the small number of oems in our industry  most of whom are already our customers  it would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of  reduction in  cancellation of or delay in purchase orders by  any one of these customers 
consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
in addition  any significant pricing pressure exerted by a key customer could adversely affect our operating results 
we have had to qualify  and are required to maintain our status  as a supplier for each of our customers 
this is a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering  documentation  manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders 
our ability to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of or reduction in sales to an existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers is minimal because of these qualification requirements 
consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of  or any reduction in orders by  any of our significant customers 
in  and   and  respectively  of our total sales were derived from sales outside the united states  based upon the location to which our products were shipped 
anticipated increased general and administrative costs the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  and the nasdaq national market  have required changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make legal  accounting and administrative activities more time consuming and costly 
in particular  we anticipate being classified as an accelerated filer  as defined in exchange act rule b  as of the end of the second quarter of as a result  beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december   our auditors will be required to audit and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight will be required 
we will experience additional costs  especially in  as we complete documentation of our internal control procedures in anticipation of our section compliance 
currency fluctuations our international sales are denominated primarily  though not entirely  in us dollars 
many of the costs and expenses associated with our shanghai facility are paid in chinese renminbi  and we expect our exposure to the renminbi to increase as we ramp up production in that facility 
in addition  purchases of some of our components are denominated in japanese yen 
changes in exchange rates among other currencies in which our revenues or costs are denominated and the us dollar may affect our revenues  cost of sales and operating margins 
while fluctuations in the value of our revenues  cost of sales and operating margins as measured in us dollars have 
table of contents not materially affected our results of operations historically  we do not currently hedge our exchange exposure and adverse exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and stock options to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived almost exclusively from a few oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and flat panel display industries in the united states 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not substantially completed a product or fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
determination of criteria in the third and fourth bullet points above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations on  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lesser of standard cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 

table of contents accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowance to impair our tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill  purchased technology and tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas no 
require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one segment and have one reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill  and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  sfas no 
requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
stock options to employees we account for our employee stock purchase plan and employee stock based compensation plan in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
accordingly  no compensation is recognized for purchase rights issued through our employee stock purchase plan or employee stock based awards granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
we apply the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
requires the disclosure of pro forma net income as though we had adopted the fair value method since our inception 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of certain option pricing models  including the black scholes option pricing model 
such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable  fully transferable options with no vesting restrictions  conditions that differ significantly from our stock option awards 
these models also require the use of subjective assumptions  including expected time to exercise  which greatly affect the calculated values 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company as of the interim reporting period beginning january  based on the unvested stock based awards outstanding at december   we do not anticipate 
table of contents that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  depending on valuation factors such as the price of our common stock  if we grant stock based awards at a similar volume to what was granted in prior years  the application of sfas no 
r could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock and other deferred compensation total operating expenses income from operations interest expense and other  net income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease reflected softening demand among semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers as the industry coped with weakness in end market demand 
included in the million in sales for the year ended december  is million related to sales of products other than gas delivery systems  including chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies and process modules as compared to approximately million in historically  a relatively small number of oem customers have accounted for a significant portion of our sales 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc are our three largest customers and each has greater than of our total sales 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales to our three largest customers were  and and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower factory absorption 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment  design and implementation  new product design and testing and other product development activities 
research and development expense was approximately million for each of the years ended december  and as a percentage of sales  research and development expense increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a lower revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with our sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a lower revenue base in as compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead of our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million relating to the addition of administrative personnel in china  million in accounting and consulting costs relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  million in severance costs associated with the departure of our former chief financial officer and million expenses related to a potential acquisition  discussions for which were terminated during the fourth quarter of stock and other deferred compensation stock and other deferred compensation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of stock charges related to the vesting of our series a senior notes following our initial public offering in interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income expense  net over the comparable prior period is primarily attributable to increased income earned on higher cash balances and a decline in interest expense as a result of the retirement of all of our outstanding series a senior notes in income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our effective tax rate is substantially impacted by several items including the extraterritorial income exclusion  section deduction for domestic production activities and the effect of foreign operations 
the decreased rate in primarily reflects a change in our geographic mix of worldwide earnings and tax benefits associated with the extraterritorial income exclusion 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or million to million from million for the year ended december  an increase in end user demand for semiconductors during 
table of contents resulted in increased demand in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and therefore increased demand for our gas delivery systems 
in addition  we began shipping frame assemblies in the second quarter of and top plate assemblies in the fourth quarter of these new product shipments contributed million to revenue in gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to sharply higher sales and production of gas delivery systems 
in addition  the increased production resulted in significantly higher factory utilization and therefore we were able to absorb more fixed costs and costs of operations  resulting in higher gross profit as a percentage of sales 
we also implemented several cost containment measures during the second half of  including work force reductions and mandatory time off 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in spending was due to an increase in engineering activity associated with new product design  test equipment and other product development activities including a new product design and customer specific design modifications for our next generation catalytic steam generator 
as a percentage of sales  however  research and development expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of sales was attributable to the steep increase in total net sales 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
this increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to approximately million in additional compensation paid to our sales and service employees due to the higher revenue generated  and the balance of the increase was due to increased travel expense  approximately million in costs associated with evaluation units and product samples  and increased sales activities by our engineers 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  due to the significantly higher sales in compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we experienced higher general and administrative expense in  primarily due to approximately million in costs attributable to the addition of new administrative employees as a result of our significantly higher levels of manufacturing activity  approximately million in costs related to legal  accounting  consulting  insurance and other fees associated with our becoming a public company  and approximately million for costs associated with the startup activities of our shanghai facility 
also included in general and administrative expense in was million for costs associated with our consideration of an acquisition that we decided not to pursue during the third quarter 

table of contents stock and other deferred compensation stock and other deferred compensation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the vesting of our series a senior notes following our initial public offering 
interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december  reduced to million from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in interest expense was attributable to the retirement of our series a senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of in connection with the ultra clean acquisition 
this retirement of debt occurred after our initial public offering in the first quarter of provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was slightly less than the statutory rate of primarily as a result of a tax benefit from exempt income  which was almost entirely offset by foreign operations  state income taxes and non deductible expenses 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due to the mix of state taxable income and losses in texas combined with a consolidated net income of approximately breakeven 
unaudited quarterly financial results the following tables set forth statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included herein and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited operations data for the periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future 
fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year in thousands net sales gross profit net income loss net sales gross profit net income our operating results for fiscal reflect a slowdown in industry demand that began in late as a result  revenues and gross margins for the year ended december  declined in comparison with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended december  also decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  as a result  net income for the year ended december  declined to million from million for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of december   we had cash of million as compared to million as of december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash flows were negatively impacted by a million reduction in net income and a million reduction in accounts payable as compared to the prior fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to higher levels of equipment purchases for our shanghai facility in the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million in the year ended december  we generated cash of million in fiscal through bank borrowings  which were used primarily to fund start up costs at our shanghai facility and million from the sale of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included the net proceeds from our initial public offering  partially offset by the retirement of our series a senior notes 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
revolving credit facility in november  we entered into a loan and security agreement  which we have since amended  providing for revolving loans of up to million with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the loan and security agreement contains certain financial covenants  including a tangible net worth target and minimum profitability and liquidity ratios 
borrowings under the loan and security agreement bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to per annum plus libor or the reference rate established from time to time by the lender 
interest is payable monthly  and the loan and security agreement matures on june  at any time prior to the maturity date  we may elect to convert up to million of outstanding borrowings into a three year term loan with quarterly payments of principal and interest 
this term loan would bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to per annum plus libor or plus the reference rate 
obligations under the agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
the obligations will be guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries  and such guarantees will be secured by a lien on substantially all of their assets 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a loan and security agreement providing for a borrowing facility of up to million with a bank in china 
the borrowing facility is secured by a standby letter of credit issued under our credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under this facility was per annum at december  as of december   the balance outstanding under the facility was million  a portion of which was repayable in renminbi 
capital expenditures we made capital expenditures of million in year ended december   most of which was for facility leasehold improvements and equipment in connection with the establishment of our shanghai facility  million on capital expenditures for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  
table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than with respect to the revolving credit facility described above  we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates or equity prices 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a loan and security agreement providing for revolving loans of up to million with a bank in china 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the revolving loans was million  a portion of which is repayable in renminbi 
if we enter into future borrowing arrangements or borrow under our existing revolving credit facility  we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate changes by using a mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt  together with interest rate swaps where appropriate  to fix or lower our borrowing costs 
we do not make material sales in currencies other than the us dollar or have material purchase obligations outside of the united states  except in china where we had purchase commitments totaling million in us dollar equivalents 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates applied to the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future
