item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following are some important factors that could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants and the covenants contained in the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes will limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our high debt level and the various covenants contained in the indentures related to our senior notes  senior subordinated notes and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors  our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to pay principal of and interest on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  to service our other debt and to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
if our significant customer changes its purchasing habits  our business could be adversely impacted 
procter gamble is our largest single customer 
we supply procter gamble with fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens 
while procter gamble has previously accounted for a higher percentage of our total revenues  sales to procter gamble accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal year in the event that procter gamble fails to continue to purchase these products from us in substantial volume  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely impact our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements 
because it is difficult to predict the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities 
the foley plant  located in perry  florida  discharges treated wastewater into the fenholloway river 
under the terms of an agreement with the florida department of environmental protection fdep  approved by the u 
s 
environmental protection agency the epa in  we agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain class iii fishable swimmable status for the fenholloway river under applicable florida law the fenholloway agreement 
the fenholloway agreement requires us  among other things  to i make process changes within the foley plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge  ii restore certain wetlands areas  iii relocate the wastewater discharge point into the fenholloway river to a point closer to the mouth of the river  and iv provide oxygen enrichment to the treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location 
we have completed the process changes within the foley plant as required by the fenholloway agreement 
in making these in plant process changes  we incurred significant expenditures  and  as discussed in the following paragraph  we expect to incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with the remaining obligations under the fenholloway agreement 
based on the requirements  we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately million over to years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal year the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these possible expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because approximately of our sales are to customers outside the united states  we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in approximately countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united states represented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the u 
s 
dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities 
as of august   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately  are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida  and memphis  tennessee 
on october   the union at our foley plant ratified a new labor agreement effective through march  the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  the union at our canadian facility ratified a new labor agreement effective through june  works councils provide employee representation for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumberton and king  north carolina are not unionized 
none of our facilities has had labor disputes or work stoppages in recent history 
the foley and memphis plants have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disputes in over years and years  respectively 
we consider our relationships with our employees and their representative organizations to be good 
an extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclicality of our industry 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
for example  energy and chemical costs have increased substantially which has resulted in increased production costs for our products 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
in the united states  an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck and rail could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
executive summary buckeye manufactures and distributes value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
we believe that we can continue to expand market share  improve profitability and decrease our exposure to cyclical downturns by pursuing the following strategic objectives focus on technically demanding niche markets  develop and commercialize innovative proprietary products  strengthen long term alliances with customers  provide our products at an attractive value  and significantly reduce our debt 
we earned net income of million for fiscal year these operating results included restructuring and impairment charges related to the closure of our glueckstadt  germany specialty fiber facility  impairment expenses related to our closed facility in lumberton  north carolina  and early extinguishment of debt totaling of million million after tax 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a increase over the million achieved in fiscal year during fiscal year  higher energy  chemical and transportation costs compressed our margins 
although some energy related costs have retreated recently  energy  chemical and transportation costs were more than million higher during fiscal year than they were during the same period in  offsetting higher sales due to strong demand for specialty products 
the hurricanes that devastated the us gulf coast had a large impact on our costs 
while none of our operations suffered serious physical damage  the disruptions caused by the storms and the impact of already high energy  chemical and transportation costs caused earnings to fall significantly below those earned during fiscal year manufacturing difficulties at our large specialty wood pulp facility in perry  florida and transportation issues also negatively impacted our business during fiscal year as a result of these extraordinarily high costs  we implemented product price surcharges of up to on our products 
this surcharge was effective for most of our products manufactured in the united states excluding fluff pulp from october  through march  in addition to the surcharge  we implemented further price increases in january of averaging on specialty wood cellulose products 
we removed the product price surcharge effective april  due to the return of natural gas pricing to more normal levels 
price increases for specialty fibers and nonwoven materials were implemented effective april  these price increases and the reduced energy costs offset the reduction in revenue from the elimination of the product price surcharge 
although the price increases discussed above were sufficient to maintain our margins in the high end segments of our markets  pricing on fluff pulp for fiscal year was slightly below the level we achieved during fiscal year this combination of low prices and higher costs during fiscal year resulted in our operating profit on fluff pulp being about million below the levels achieved in fiscal year this decline in operating profit for fluff pulp more than offset the profitability improvements in our high end specialty wood products and nonwoven materials 
during fiscal year  we completed the upgrade of our cotton cellulose manufacturing facility in americana  brazil and are now producing product for market sales 
prior to the transition of the facility to market production  we were manufacturing product for an on site customer under an arrangement in which the customer provided raw materials and paid us a manufacturing fee 
we ceased this toll manufacturing arrangement in november the combination of start up costs incurred this fiscal year and the loss of the profitability from the tolling operations we received during the same periods in fiscal resulted in a negative impact of approximately million before tax during fiscal year although we expect improvement  we believe that operating performance for the americana facility during fiscal year will still compare negatively to the operating performance of our toll manufacturing configuration during the same period in in spite of the higher costs  we are encouraged by progress on several fronts o we continued to generate strong cash flows during the year with million cash generated from operations  enabling us to complete the upgrade of the americana facility and reduce debt and capital leases by million during fiscal year o in january  we established two new organizations within buckeye 
marketing the mission of the organization is to bring new products to the market on an accelerated schedule 
the new organization is focused on improving our marketing capability and increasing the speed at which we commercialize new products 
lean enterprise the mission is to lead our efforts in lowering costs  reducing working capital and eliminating waste 
this new organization is responsible for the implementation of the lean enterprise methodology throughout our operations 
the new organization is focused on improving work processes to ensure that all activities bring value to our customers 
our near term objective is to improve gross margins by one percentage point through lean improvements 
o we continue to establish our global sales and distribution network for ultrafiber tm  a revolutionary concrete reinforcing fiber 
ultrafiber tm is a niche product for the building industry and a great example of the new product initiatives we are undertaking to reduce our dependency on fluff pulp 
sales reached approximately million in fiscal and our goal is to exceed million in fiscal o our plan to transition the specialty fibers production previously supplied by glueckstadt  germany to our lower cost manufacturing facilities in memphis  tennessee and americana  brazil is proceeding 
we believe we are well positioned to supply cotton based specialty fiber products from our facilities in memphis and americana  with a significantly more favorable cost structure once we reach full production at the americana facility 
the combination of new product initiatives  strong demand in important markets  and an improved  lower cost manufacturing configuration gives us optimism that we can generate future growth in sales and profitability 
like other manufacturing firms  we are still being negatively impacted by high costs for energy  chemicals  transportation and other materials 
these issues will slow progress in the short term  but our longer term outlook remains favorable 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income loss for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs operating income loss percent change is not meaningful 
net sales increased during fiscal year primarily due to improved pricing and mix on our products 
demand for high end specialty fibers helped drive prices higher throughout the year 
higher shipment volumes and increased pricing drove sales of nonwoven materials higher during fiscal year additionally  the implementation of the product price surcharge effective october  through march  had a positive impact on revenues 
the product price surcharge improved revenues by million for fiscal year net sales improved overall during fiscal due primarily to increased pricing and improved mix in both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
as mentioned in the executive summary  cost of goods sold and gross margins were negatively impacted by high costs related to increases in the pricing of energy  chemicals and transportation 
during fiscal year  these costs were higher by approximately versus fiscal year during fiscal  cost of goods sold increased by on an overall volume increase of approximately 
this consistency was the result of two offsetting factors 
increased chemical and energy related costs began impacting our facilities during the year 
these increases were offset by the absence of several additional specialty fibers charges related to unusual events and special circumstances  including an extended maintenance shutdown at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility that occurred during fiscal increases in selling  research and administrative expenses during fiscal also had a negative impact on our operating margins 
expenses related to the establishment of an ultrafiber tm sales force and distribution network  the expensing of share based payments and the expensing of previously capitalized patent costs contributed to increased costs 
during fiscal  selling  research and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased accounting and consulting fees related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley 
external costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley exceeded million for fiscal this increase was partially offset by the absence of million of bad debt expense incurred during fiscal as a result of the bankruptcy filing of a large specialty fibers customer 
as part of the announced closure of the glueckstadt  germany specialty fibers facility  we continued to incur restructuring expenses during fiscal year we incurred million of expenses during fiscal year we expect to incur only minimal additional costs related to this restructuring 
during fiscal year  we reclassified the land  buildings and equipment at the glueckstadt facility to assets held for sale 
additionally  we reevaluated the fair value less cost to sell and recognized an impairment charge of million 
during june  we sold the land  the buildings and a majority of the equipment 
further discussion of revenue  operating trends  impairment and restructuring costs can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the impairment and restructuring programs and charges may also be found in note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment is an aggregation of cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment  amortization of intangibles and certain financing and investing costs 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income although demand for our high end specialty fibers products and the implementation of a product price surcharge pushed pricing higher during fiscal year  the favorable earnings impact of higher prices was offset by lower volumes due to the closure of our glueckstadt  germany cotton specialty fibers facility  the start up of market operations of our americana  brazil facility and production and transportation issues at our perry  florida facility 
net sales increased during fiscal primarily due to an increase in specialty wood shipment volume and higher selling prices for both wood and cotton based products 
average fluff pulp pricing declined by less than during fiscal year versus fiscal year although we experienced pricing softness for fluff pulp during the year  in the most recently completed quarter fluff pulp prices trended upward 
for fiscal year  fluff pulp sales accounted for of our consolidated sales 
strong demand in our high end markets allowed us to raise prices during the year to partially offset higher costs for energy  chemicals and transportation 
however  due to the rapid and continued increase in costs along with the slightly lower prices for fluff pulp  we were unable to maintain our margins at the same level as those realized during fiscal year our specialty fibers manufacturing costs for chemicals  energy and transportation increased by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year while we made some progress to recover a portion of these costs through reductions in raw material usage  increased pricing for our products and the implementation of a product price surcharge from october  through march   these abnormally high energy  chemical and transportation prices will continue to put pressure on our margins during fiscal although the natural gas component of our energy costs is returning to normal pricing levels  our other energy related costs including chemicals and transportation still remain higher than normal 
in addition to recovering margins through increased pricing  we are also working on ways to reduce manufacturing costs 
when natural gas prices were abnormally high  we transitioned our energy supply from natural gas to fuel oil where possible 
although natural gas is a very efficient energy source  market price volatility may make it more economical to purchase fuel oil at certain times 
we will continue to look for alternatives to reduce costs and recover margins 
our new lean enterprise initiative  discussed in the executive summary  is focused on reducing costs by focusing on efficient processes that add value for our customers 
we were also negatively impacted by high manufacturing costs associated with maintenance outages at our specialty fibers facility in perry  florida 
we incurred an unplanned lime kiln outage  requiring an increase in purchased materials 
additionally  we installed new chemical recycling equipment to improve our efficiency and further minimize our environmental impact 
during these outages  we lost production at the facility 
in addition to the fixed costs of the facility being spread over fewer tons of production  we also lost production of our high end specialty wood products  which impacted our sales volumes  both of which adversely affected our gross margins 
the total impact of these outages was approximately million for the year 
we are continuing to make progress with developing our capability to supply a wider range of products based on cotton cellulose to customers worldwide by upgrading the capability of our americana  brazil manufacturing facility 
because brazil benefits from low manufacturing costs and a regional raw material supply  we anticipate that  when we reach full capacity  this facility will be a significant contributor to our profitability 
we completed the upgrade and began the process of qualifying our facility with our customers during january of with the cessation of tolling production in late november to facilitate the upgrade  we continued incurring pre production expenses without offsetting revenue 
during fiscal year  the net impact of the americana startup decreased before tax earnings by approximately million versus fiscal year we expect to continue to incur start up and transition costs during the remainder of the calendar year as we qualify the plant and ramp up volume 
based on current progress  we believe the plant in americana will be operating profitably by the third quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  rising energy and chemical prices pushed manufacturing costs higher 
the allocation of sales  research and administrative costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley regulations also offset the improvement in pricing  mix  and volume during fiscal in spite of the increase in costs  operating income substantially improved during fiscal based on the strong improvement in sales and the absence of several additional charges related to unusual events and special situations that occurred during fiscal these unusual events and special situations included the planned maintenance shutdown of our perry  florida facility million  the bankruptcy of a large customer million  the ratification of a new labor agreement that included a one time retroactive payment million  and higher costs associated with reduced production at our perry  florida and memphis  tennessee specialty fibers facilities 
nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income improvements in the mix  selling prices and volumes for our nonwoven materials resulted in an increase in net sales during fiscal year versus fiscal year in an effort to offset rising prices for raw materials and other manufacturing costs  we implemented sales price increases during the year 
effective october   we implemented a product pricing surcharge for most of our products manufactured in the united states to offset higher energy related costs 
increased demand for high end napkins and other tabletop products in our european markets contributed to an improved mix 
due to a decline in the cost for natural gas  we removed the surcharge effective april  decreased energy costs and the implementation of permanent price increases effective april  allowed us to maintain our margins in spite of the removal of the surcharge 
these improvements in net sales were partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the majority of products sold at our steinfurt facility are denominated in euros and translated to us dollars for consolidation 
the increase in net sales during fiscal was due to improved pricing and mix  and the relative strength of the euro versus the us dollar 
although we ceased production at our cork  ireland facility in july  we continued shipping inventory from cork through november and completed the transition of a majority of cork s sales to our other nonwoven materials facilities 
improved pricing  mix and increased volumes overcame higher raw materials and other manufacturing costs to improve operating margins during the year 
higher revenues offset increased costs for energy  chemical and transportation  which drove costs approximately million higher for fiscal year than they were during fiscal year additionally  the stronger canadian dollar created further pressure on operating costs at our nonwoven materials facility in delta  british columbia 
operating income improved significantly for fiscal versus fiscal year the improvement was primarily due to higher selling prices and the closure of our high cost cork  ireland facility 
overall  our nonwoven materials business supported similar shipment and production volume with one less manufacturing facility for the majority of the year 
our gaston  north carolina facility continued to show improvement in its operating performance compared to the prior year due to significant increases in shipment volume and the resulting improvement in capacity utilization 
these improvements were partially offset by price increases on raw materials and other manufacturing costs 
the cost of fluff pulp  bi component fibers  and binder materials increased during fiscal restructuring and impairment activities during the three years ended june   we entered into various restructuring programs  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to continue to provide both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials at attractive values  we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs and optimize our operating structure 
the following table summarizes restructuring expense by program and impairment charges for the three years ended june  following the table is an explanation of the programs and the resulting impairment charges 
for further explanation of these charges  see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended june total millions charges impairment charges restructuring costs restructuring program restructuring program restructuring program phase restructuring program phase total restructuring costs restructuring program and impairments in january  we announced our decision to discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at our glueckstadt  germany facility 
our decision was due to a combination of factors that had increased the plant s costs to a level at which it was uneconomical to continue operations 
the most significant factor impacting cost at the site was the substantial strengthening of the euro over calendar and specialty fibers are normally priced and sold in us dollars around the world 
as a majority of glueckstadt s costs were denominated in euros  this substantial strengthening had a negative impact on glueckstadt s cost position 
additionally  glueckstadt s process water  waste treatment and energy costs were more than twice the cost of these utilities at our memphis  tennessee cotton based specialty fibers facility 
faced with these difficulties  we reduced the number of employees at the facility from approximately to approximately and operated at of capacity during calendar year after careful consideration  we decided to close and cease production at glueckstadt in december we believe that the closure of our glueckstadt facility and transfer of the majority of its cotton based specialty fiber production to our memphis  tennessee and americana  brazil facilities will yield a more competitive cost structure 
based on our inability to recover the remaining value of the long lived assets at the glueckstadt  germany facility  we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million  were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million million after tax  during fiscal year during fiscal year  we began to actively market the land and buildings  and the equipment which had carrying values of million and million  respectively 
current markets and third party interest for the land and buildings indicated we would not be able to recover the carrying value through the sales process 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the land and buildings to their fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an additional impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the land and building for million 
as of june   management reevaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the remaining equipment and determined an additional impairment should be recognized for equipment with a carrying value of million 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the remaining equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million 
although we believe the current carrying value less cost to sell represents the fair value of the equipment  it is possible the actual results of a sale could materially differ from amounts estimated 
the closure of the glueckstadt facility resulted in the termination of employees  and restructuring expenses related to the closure of million over fiscal year and we expect this consolidation to enable us to improve our overall specialty fibers operating results by approximately million annually 
in anticipation of the closure of the facility  customers increased their inventories to ensure a smooth transition as they qualified material supplied from our memphis  tennessee facility 
due to the increased demand  we were able to increase pricing and make incremental sales from inventory 
additionally  as a result of the impairment of the glueckstadt plant and equipment  there was a decrease in depreciation expense during fiscal year restructuring program and impairments during march  our board of directors approved the discontinuation of production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
while the demand for nonwoven products grew at a rate in the low to mid single digits on an annualized basis  the growth in demand was not sufficient to utilize the existing capacity fully 
as such  industry participants rationalized production by idling plants and closing facilities 
due to excess production capacity around the globe  we operated cork below its productive capacity from its inception in because of its location and small size  our cost to produce at cork was higher than at our other locations 
due to these issues  we decided to close the cork facility and consolidate production at our three other nonwoven manufacturing facilities 
production at cork ceased in july closing our cork facility reduced our nonwovens capacity by about 
we continued to meet customer needs for nonwoven materials by producing these products at our facilities in delta  british columbia  canada  steinfurt  germany  and gaston county  north carolina 
this consolidation reduced working capital needs  and we began to realize fully the on going cost benefit from operating one less facility during the third quarter of fiscal the closure of the cork facility and related reorganization of the nonwoven materials segment resulted in the termination of employees and resulted in restructuring expenses totaling million 
we do not expect additional expenses related to this program 
our commitment to discontinue production represented an indicator of impairment  and subsequently we evaluated the value of the property  plant  and equipment associated with the cork facility 
we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
during fiscal  we also impaired certain equipment and other capitalized costs at other facilities of million 
in late december  we completed the sale of the cork facility building for million see gain on sale of assets held for sale for further discussion 
restructuring programs phase and phase and impairments in april  we announced the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our specialty fibers lumberton  north carolina facility due to the decline in demand for cotton content paper 
we completed this partial closure in august but continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at the lumberton site 
this decision reflects a steady decline in demand in the cotton fiber paper industry  which has contracted by more than one third since the late s 
while cotton linter pulp is one of our core businesses  current demand did not economically justify operating a facility that could only produce products for paper applications 
to meet our customers needs  we consolidated our cotton linter pulp production at our larger memphis  tennessee and glueckstadt  germany facilities 
in conjunction with the consolidation  we initiated the first phase of a restructuring program designed to deliver cost reductions through reduced expenses across the company  the main component of which was the partial closure of our lumberton  north carolina facility 
this phase of restructuring resulted in the elimination of approximately positions within the specialty fibers segment 
the resulting increase in facility utilization enabled us to improve our operating results by approximately million annually 
this more efficient operating configuration began to reduce our cost of goods sold beginning in january this closure reduced our working capital needs by approximately million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a second phase of this restructuring program 
this phase of the program enabled us to improve our operating results by approximately million annually through reduced salaries  benefits  other employee related expenses and operating expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated 
these positions include manufacturing  sales  product development and administrative functions throughout the organization 
during fiscal year  we began to actively market idled cotton linter pulping equipment which had a carrying value of million 
management evaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the assets and determined an impairment should be recognized for the equipment 
we wrote down the carrying value of the equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the equipment for net proceeds of million 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for fiscal year versus fiscal year our decrease in average outstanding debt had a positive impact on interest expense during the period 
also contributing to the improvement was the impact of capitalizing interest for the americana facility capital improvements 
the total amount of interest capitalized during fiscal year  related to the americana project  was million 
these improvements were partially offset by higher variable interest rates 
the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt increased from at june  to at june  see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of variable interest rates 
we incurred interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal  down million from fiscal this improvement was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during fiscal and the absence of interest costs from holding million of senior subordinated notes due and million of senior notes due concurrently for days during the first half of the fiscal these improvements were partially offset by higher average variable interest rates during fiscal loss on early extinguishment of debt costs fiscal year on september  we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year fiscal year on march  we used cash on hand to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year fiscal year on november   we established a million senior secured credit facility 
this facility amended and restated our then existing million revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the new credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former revolving credit facility plus transaction fees and expenses 
during fiscal  million was expensed related to the early extinguishment of the previous credit facility 
on september   we placed privately million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in the notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior to any of our subordinated debt 
the notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors on our senior secured indebtedness 
we used the net proceeds from the private placement to redeem our million senior subordinated notes due as a result of the extinguishment  million was expensed during fiscal these expenses included a million call premium and million related to the write off of deferred financing costs 
see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
gain on sale of assets held for sale in july  we ceased production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
subsequent to the july closure of the facility  we began to actively market the building and equipment with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
in late december of  we completed the sale of the cork facility building to the port of cork company for million 
although the carrying values of these assets were based on appraisals and available market information at the time of the impairment in march of  the purchase of this building for strategic purposes by the port of cork company was not contemplated in those appraisals 
as a result of the sale and disposition of the building and equipment for net proceeds after decommissioning and other expenses of million  we recognized a net gain of million million net of tax during fiscal year foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency losses as a result of the strengthening of the canadian dollar during the fiscal year 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to million of expenses related to amending our senior secured credit facility and other financing related costs 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in fiscal and in fiscal effective june   many of the tax measures introduced in the canadian federal budget were passed into law 
included in the budget was a reduction in the general corporate tax rate to for  for  and for and later years 
as a result  the company remeasured its canadian deferred tax balances based on the reversal pattern of the company s temporary differences  resulting in a million net tax benefit 
our brazilian valuation allowance increased in due to larger losses associated with the slower than expected start up of the americana  brazil operations 
effective for transactions occurring after september  the internal revenue service enacted the extraterritorial income exclusion 
the income exclusion provides for a reduction of gross income by a percentage of qualifying foreign trade income 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
in order to comply with international trade rules  the act repealed the current tax treatment for extraterritorial income 
effective for transactions entered into after december   the extraterritorial income exclusion is subject to a phase out which will be completed on december  for transactions during calendar years and  the income exclusion will be and of the exclusion otherwise allowed  respectively 
our extraterritorial income exclusion benefit was reduced in fiscal due to this phase out and will continue to decrease through the final phase out during fiscal the act provides a tax deduction for domestic manufacturers 
the deduction will be phased in during fiscal years through due to the company s us net operating loss position  this deduction had no impact to fiscal year see note  income taxes  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the irs completed an audit of our tax return for fiscal year with the conclusion of this audit  we released the reserve on a tax deduction we claimed relating to our investment in our former facility in cork  ireland and recorded a non cash tax benefit of million to our provision for income taxes 
cumulative effect of change in accounting historically  we accrued in advance expenses related to planned extended maintenance shutdowns at our perry  florida facility 
however  as of july   we changed our method of accounting from the accrue in advance method to the direct expense method 
the effect of applying the new method for the year ended june  was a decrease in net loss composed of a profit increase of million pre tax million net of tax reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change  offset by million million net of tax in additional cost of goods sold compared to what would have been expensed in fiscal under the accrue in advance methodology 
the total cost of the related planned maintenance activity performed in was million 
historically  we perform planned extended maintenance shutdowns at our perry  florida facility in two to five year intervals 
due to variability in the timing and activities associated with our planned extended maintenance shutdowns  it is difficult to predict the future costs of these activities 
see note  change in accounting  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this change in accounting 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during fiscal year we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june  and believe we will continue to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt and capital leases decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june  and at june  on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility 
the portion of this capacity that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility 
as of june   our liquidity  including available borrowings and cash and cash equivalents was approximately million 
management believes this is sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the business 
we believe we will continue to have positive cash flow and these borrowing conditions are not expected to impact our operating or investing activities  or our ability to service our debt obligations 
treasury stock our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we will hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock and such shares will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
in fiscal  we repurchased no shares of our common stock 
through june   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the current board authority 
cash flow while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income loss noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment proceeds from sales of assets other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit proceeds from debt issuances payments on long term debt and other other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily the result of the decrease in net income in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by general improvements in working capital during fiscal although the closure of our glueckstadt  germany cotton cellulose facility improved working capital in fiscal  this improvement was partially offset by increased working capital requirements at our americana  brazil specialty fibers facility as we moved away from the previous tolling arrangement toward new market production 
we believe there are still opportunities to reduce working capital requirements and improve cash flow during fiscal year the million improvement in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily the result of improvements in net income in fiscal due to an overall reduction in working capital during fiscal  there was limited cash generation ability from changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment were consistent during fiscal and  but were higher than fiscal year  primarily due to expenditures related to the project to add full market capability to our americana  brazil cotton cellulose facility 
the total cost of this facility improvement excluding capitalized interest was approximately million  of which approximately million was spent during fiscal and million was spent during fiscal we expect further spending related to the americana facility upgrade will be minimal 
although the americana project is completed  we expect efficiency improvement and energy savings projects  maintenance capital  and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with remaining environmental obligations at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility 
based on current estimates we expect expenditures of approximately million over years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we sold the cork  ireland building and equipment for net proceeds of million 
these proceeds offset the increase in capital expenditures during the year 
during fiscal  in addition to our basic capital maintenance expenditures of approximately million  we made expenditures at our foley plant for a planned maintenance shutdown and capital expenditures at our memphis  tennessee facility to provide the capability to manufacture cotton cellulose products previously manufactured at our lumberton  north carolina facility 
the low level of capital spending achieved during was due to an overall effort to reduce capital expenditures and the lack of any major construction projects during those years 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year we used cash from operations to finance the capital investments we made at our americana  brazil facility  and to redeem  at par  million principal amount of our high interest rate   senior subordinated notes due in we intend to continue to redeem portions of the remaining million of these notes ahead of their maturity in the fall of these partial redemptions will be limited by available cash and our capacity to make restricted cash payments under our other debt instruments 
we are focused on debt reduction with an intermediate term objective of a debt to equity balance in our capital structure 
during fiscal year  we used cash from operating activities to reduce the principal balances on our debt and capital leases by million 
we called  at par  million of our high interest rate   senior subordinated notes due in see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of june  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years long term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations timber commitments linter commitments other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations amounts include related interest payments 
interest payments for variable debt of million are based on the effective rate as of june  of 
see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rates 
capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments 
see note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
see note  commitments  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
linter commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business that usually are less than one year in length 
the majority of other purchase commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business related to utilities and raw material purchases 
less than one year references fiscal  years references fiscal and  years references fiscal and note additionally  the cash flow to fund postretirement benefit obligations has an expected net present value of million 
the actuarially estimated annual benefit payments net of retiree contributions are as follows million  million  million  and through million 
these obligations are not included in the table above as the total obligation is based on the present value of the payments and would not be consistent with the contractual cash obligations disclosures included in the table above 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  a significant customer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  we recorded an increase in our estimate for bad debts of million during fiscal deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowances recorded against certain foreign and state net operating losses by approximately million  since we believe it more likely than not that these assets will not result in a future tax benefit 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
however  where treatment of an item is uncertain  tax contingency reserves are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter 
these reserves are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities 
we adjust these reserves when an identifiable event occurs that changes the most probable outcome 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets and  in any case  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
during fiscal  based on changes in utilization estimates  we increased depreciation expense by million 
we had no changes in estimates or assumptions during fiscal or long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets are determined not be recoverable  then an impairment is recognized 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
based on the estimated fair values of long lived assets  we have recorded impairment charges of million  million  and million for years ended june    and  respectively 
if circumstances change  our estimated fair values may be impacted and have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  of our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas  goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of future cash flows 
the discount rate  adjusted for inflation  is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record impairment losses in the future 
see note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long lived assets 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value of other long term debt approximates fair value based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to million increase in the fair value of long term debt 
we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to european interbank rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
buckeye and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no fossil fuel contracts outstanding at june  or requiring fair value treatment 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities
