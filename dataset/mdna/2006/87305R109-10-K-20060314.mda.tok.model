we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
in addition  we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex  multilayer printed circuit boards  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial markets including the networking communications infrastructure  high end computing and industrial medical markets which are characterized by high levels of complexity  short product life cycles and moderate production volumes 
our customers include oems and ems companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
the market for our products experienced a sustained downturn during and  due to the economic slowdown in the electronics industry 
during this period  we reduced our work force and focused on cost reduction by improving the efficiency of our operations and negotiating lower prices on key supplies from our vendors 
throughout this period  we generated positive cash flow from operations  added new customers  and continued to invest in our future growth  adding capital equipment and acquiring advanced circuits in december during  we generated increased sales due to the inclusion of advanced circuits  market share gains  and the improving economic conditions in the electronics industry and our customers end markets 
our gross profit margin also increased from to  due to our improved operating leverage as costs that are largely fixed in nature  such as labor  were absorbed over greater production volume 
market conditions continued to improve in  resulting in further revenue growth and expanded gross margins 
during the first half of  prices for our printed circuit boards declined leading to lower revenue and gross margins 
however  prices as well as production volume increased during the second half of  leading to increased revenue and expanded gross margins 
we manufacture printed circuit boards at three specialized and integrated facilities in the united states 
our facility in santa ana  california specializes in quick turn work  which has delivery times of ten days or less and is characterized by small volumes of printed circuit boards 
our chippewa falls  wisconsin facility focuses on higher volume production runs of technologically complex multilayer printed circuit boards with average lead times of two to ten weeks 
our redmond  washington facility focuses on mid volume production of standard lead time printed circuit boards 
although our facilities are specialized  we are able to transfer work among our plants to maximize production during periods of peak demand 
in response to increased customer demand and higher capacity utilization rates  in february  our board of directors approved a plan to significantly expand production capacity at our chippewa falls  wisconsin facility 
chippewa falls is our largest facility and serves the high end  complex technology needs of some of our largest and most sophisticated commercial customers 
the plan included a two phase expansion  enabling us to incrementally match our capital expenditures with demand and market conditions 
we believe that our ability to expand at our existing facilities allows us to efficiently grow without having to qualify customers for  and develop management infrastructure at  a new facility 
phase one of the expansion plan  which featured the construction of a  square foot addition and the purchase of capital equipment  increased capacity by approximately from capacity levels as of the first quarter of  and was completed in march at a capital cost of approximately million 
should we choose to pursue it  the second phase of the chippewa falls expansion plan would allow us to expand production capacity an additional from the maximum levels provided by phase one 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and approximately as of december  sales to our largest customers accounted for of our net sales in and of our net sales in we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in 
table of contents the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated year ended december  end markets networking communication high end computing industrial medical computer peripherals handheld cellular other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders increased from of net sales in to of net sales in  due to higher demand for our ramp to volume production services 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an amount for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on our historical results 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume and yield 
as of the end of  we were operating at approximately of our production capacity 
we do not participate in any significant long term supply contracts  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
as general economic conditions continue to improve  we expect to receive more quick turn orders due to increased prototype work related to new product introductions at our customers 
as these quick turn sales become a higher percentage of total sales  our average commission rate is expected to increase 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technologies  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense and bad debt expense 
we expect these 
table of contents expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of intangible assets  which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july our restructuring charges in relate primarily to severance costs to consolidate overhead operations following the acquisition of advanced circuits in december as well as a further write down of assets held for sale 
restructuring charges in relate to the final write down of assets held for sale associated with the sale of the burlington  washington facility 
our interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and our other long term obligations 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related expenses 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest received on our cash balances 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies where significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  realizability of deferred tax assets  and self insured medical reserves 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
our inventory requirements change based on our projected customer demand  which changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes and longer or shorter than expected usage periods 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we 
table of contents perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our quick turn business 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and determined that no impairment existed 
at december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets  goodwill and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have net deferred income tax assets of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of approximately million 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to adjust our valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets would be realizable in an amount greater than what is already recorded  we would reverse all or a portion of valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
we are self insured for group health insurance benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carrier for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carrier and broker to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to a total limitation that varies based on employee enrollment and factors that are established at each annual contract renewal 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced circuits in december  we became contractually responsible for the majority of a rebate obligation to a customer 
the rebate is based on a percentage of net sales to this customer 
we have made estimates regarding the amount and timing of future net sales to this customer and have applied a discount factor to those estimated rebates to estimate the present value of our obligation 
we have also estimated that portion of the total obligation which we believe is a current liability 
based on our future net sales experience with this customer  we may change our estimate of the portion that is a current liability 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net income before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax benefit provision benefit income before extraordinary item extraordinary gain net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in due to declining prices  partially offset by an increase in production volume 
volume increased approximately primarily due to higher demand from our customers for our products 
prices fell approximately primarily due to increased competition and excess capacity in the north american printed circuit board industry  partially offset by a shift in product mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  increased from of revenue in to of revenue in gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold as well as price increases in raw materials  higher repair and maintenance costs  higher utilities costs  primarily natural gas  and higher depreciation expense 
in addition  higher wage rates and greater headcount led to increased labor costs  but these increases were partially offset by a reduced incentive compensation accrual 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for to for primarily due to declining prices and higher absolute costs  partially offset by increased absorption of fixed costs 

table of contents as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin decreased from in to in the decline in our gross margin was due to lower prices for our products as well as higher cost of goods sold  which increased due to the factors discussed above 
this decline in gross margin was somewhat mitigated by increased absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases 
however  at higher capacity utilization rates  additional employees and capital may be required 
our average layer count increased from in to in operating expenses selling and marketing expenses remained essentially flat at million for and as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses remained unchanged at during the same periods of time 
the mix of selling and marketing expenses did not change significantly from to general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from a net million loss contingency accrual related to reaching a definitive agreement with a customer to resolve a dispute concerning certain goods shipped in and  higher accounting fees for the audit of internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  and higher labor expense due to higher wage rates  partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and costs related to a proposed public stock offering in the second fiscal quarter general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the net increase in expenses described in this paragraph 
in the second fiscal quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to write down the value of our burlington  washington building prior to selling it 
we subsequently sold it in the fourth fiscal quarter other income expense other income expense improved million from income of million in to income of million in this increase resulted from higher interest income due to higher cash and short term investment balances and higher interest rates in as compared to as well as lower interest expense in due to the repayment of our term loan in income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from a million provision for to a million benefit for the change from an income tax provision in to an income tax benefit in resulted from lower pretax income in combined with a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax provision rate was in and our effective tax benefit rate was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
in addition  during and  we decreased our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and benefited our and income tax provision by million and million  respectively  for the portion that we determined that is more likely than not to be realized 
the reduction in valuation allowance in occurred during the fourth quarter given the additional positive evidence from continued historical earnings and expectations of future earnings which was sufficient for us to conclude that it was more likely than not that most of our deferred income tax assets will be realized 
excluding the favorable impacts to our tax provision resulting from the decreases in our valuation allowance in and  our effective tax rate in was and in as of december   our valuation allowance was approximately million 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  the effective 
table of contents income tax rate could change due to changes in the mix of income  changes to income tax credits and changes to the valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to increases in both price and production volume 
improving prices accounted for approximately of the increase in net sales 
prices improved due to a number of factors  including a continued strengthening of the economy in and a shift in mix to higher technology products 
we generally charge higher prices for printed circuit boards with time sensitive delivery requirements  high layer counts and other high technology features because of both the higher material content and the greater level of skill required to manufacture these boards 
increased production volume accounted for approximately of the increase in net sales from to this volume increase resulted from higher demand from our customers 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for higher cost of goods sold resulted primarily from higher labor and materials costs associated with an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for due to greater labor and production efficiencies  lower materials costs and improved absorption of manufacturing overhead 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin improved from in to in the improvement in our gross margin was due largely to higher prices as well as greater labor efficiency  lower per unit materials costs and increased absorption of fixed costs 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases  except for direct materials 
however  at higher capacity utilization rates  additional employees and capital may be required 
these gains in efficiency helped offset the increased costs related to our shift toward more complex work characterized by higher layer counts 
our average layer count increased from in to in operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from additional commission expense related to the increase in net sales 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved absorption of fixed selling costs and a mix shift toward products that bear lower commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from higher incentive compensation expense  costs related to a proposed public stock offering and higher accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  partially offset by lower insurance expense and lower legal fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the relatively fixed nature of these expenses and our higher sales base 
restructuring charges of million recorded in related to severance and other exit costs associated with eliminating positions at our redmond  washington facility and an impairment for our burlington  washington building 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to write down the value of our burlington  washington building prior to selling it 
there were no unutilized restructuring accruals at december  
table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from a million provision for to a million provision for the increase in the income tax provision resulted primarily from higher pretax income  partially offset by a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax rate was in  and it was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by state income taxes  which vary due to the sales and profitability mix among our facilities  as well as utilization of the federal extraterritorial income exclusion  state income tax credits and certain non deductible items 
in addition  during  we decreased our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and benefited our income tax provision by million for the portion that we determined that was more likely than not to be realized 
excluding the favorable impact resulting from the decrease in valuation allowance  our effective tax rate in was 
as of december   our valuation allowance was approximately million 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  the effective income tax rate could change due to changes in the mix of income  changes to income tax credits and changes to the valuation allowance 
extraordinary gain in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after resolving certain contingencies concerning the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits  including the settlement of a claim for a working capital adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance capital expenditures  meet debt service requirements  fund working capital and finance mergers and acquisitions 
we anticipate that these uses will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents  inventories  accounts receivable and deferred income taxes 
the following table provides information on future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  current purchase obligation related to capital expenditures  accrued contingencies and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles as of december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations accrued contingencies other long term liabilities total contractual obligations our balance sheet reflects these other long term liabilities at their net present value 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash  and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months and beyond 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond the next months are for other contractual obligations as indicated in our contractual obligations table above and for capital purchases that we make from time to time 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in our operating cash flow of million primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization  a million income tax benefit from stock options exercised  and million 
table of contents of non cash interest expense  partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax assets of million and a net increase in working capital of million  excluding cash and short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in in  we made net purchases of million of property  plant and equipment and a net reduction of million in net short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million used in financing activities in our financing net cash flow reflects proceeds of approximately million from employee stock option exercises  partially offset by payment of million of debt issuance costs for our new senior credit facility 
as of december   we have no outstanding long term debt obligations 
we have a committed revolving credit facility of million with a final maturity date of july  we have a one time option to increase the size of our revolving credit facility to million provided that no default or event of default exists  as defined in the credit agreement 
our revolving loan facility contains a million letter of credit sub facility 
we may borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving loan facility at any time 
the revolving loan bears interest at rates ranging from libor plus to or the alternate base rate  as defined in the credit agreement plus to 
the amount added to the libor rate or the alternate base rate varies depending upon our leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
as of december   we had no outstanding revolving loan balances 
we pay quarterly a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused revolving commitment amount 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants customary for this type of financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
we do have minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to salary expense for a few overseas employees 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we will be able to pass along component price increases to our customers 
seasonality we have historically experienced some seasonality in our second and third fiscal quarters in our computer peripherals and consumer electronics products
