item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operation and financial position should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  the factors described under risk factors should be considered in evaluating the company s outlook 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that it consistently applies judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the company s statement of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition  vendor and trade receivable allowances  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes and contingencies and accruals 
revenue recognition in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which superceded sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab updated certain interpretive guidance included in sab  including the sab guidance related to multiple element revenue arrangements  to reflect the issuance by the emerging issues task force eitf of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables generally  the company  in accordance with sab  recognizes revenue on the sale of products when the products are shipped  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  collection of the relevant receivable is probable and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
when the company provides a combination of products and services to customers  the arrangement is evaluated under emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  which addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
the application of the appropriate accounting guidance to our revenue requires judgment and is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale includes items such as configuration  training  installation  service  or a combination of these items 
service revenue is recognized when the applicable services are provided or for service contracts  ratably over the lives of the contracts 
vendor and trade receivable allowances pomeroy maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on both vendor and trade receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or vendors to make required payments 
the determination of a proper allowance for vendor receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the recoverability of the company s vendor receivable portfolio based primarily on account aging 
the determination of a proper allowance for trade receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the credit quality and recoverability of the company s trade receivable portfolio 
factors considered are account aging  historical bad debt experience  current economic trends and others 
the analysis is performed on both vendor and trade receivable portfolios 
a separate allowance account is maintained based on each analysis 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in facts and circumstances that pomeroy considers as impairment indicators include the following significant underperformance of the company s operating results relative to expected operating results  net book value compared to fair value  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  significant changes to the asset since the company acquired it  and the extent that the company may use an asset or changes in the manner that the company may use it 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  pomeroy compares the carrying amount of the asset to the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  pomeroy would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss  if any  would be reported in the company s results of operations 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its goodwill  pomeroy compares its reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
during fiscal  the company re aligned the structure of its internal organization such that management and the board of directors now review operating results on a consolidated basis 
as a result  the company now has one reporting unit for goodwill testing 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company had two reporting units for goodwill testing which were a products reporting unit and a services reporting unit 
the company has adopted january as the valuation date for the annual testing 
write down of goodwill  if any  would be reported in the company s results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fical  the company recorded a write down of goodwill of million as further discussed herein 
income taxes pomeroy is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
pomeroy has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets representing future deductions  as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these deductions 
pomeroy considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event pomeroy were to determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies and accruals we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and accruals arising in the ordinary course of business 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales and service revenues percentage of net sales and service revenues financial results for the fiscal years total net sales and service revenues sales equipment  supplies and leasing service total net sales and service revenues total cost of sales and service sales equipment  supplies and leasing service total cost of sales and service total gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative rent depreciation amortization provision for doubtful accounts litigation settlement restructuring and severance charges goodwill impairment charge total operating expenses income loss from operations net other expense income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net sales and service revenues 
total net sales and service revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is the result of customers not renewing product sales agreements and certain customers reducing expenditures during the loss of sales renewals is primarily a result of personnel turnover as the company began implementing certain changes to the delivery organization 
the company believes these changes will have a positive impact on future net sales and revenues 
service revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal year this increase relates to increases in revenue associated with the acquisition of alternative resources corporation arc on july  gross profit 
gross profit margin was of net sales and service revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
this gross profit was driven by increasing margin contribution from service revenue offset by declining margin contribution from product sales 
on a forward looking basis  the company expects to continue its aggressive product pricing in order to maintain market share 
reduced utilization rates from new engagements and service parts write offs has also resulted in downward pressure on service margins 
additionally  the company expects to continue increasing the breadth and depth of its service offerings  which will have a continued impact on service gross margin 
factors that may have an impact on gross margin in the future include technical employee utilization rates  the mix of the type of products sold and services provided  the percentage of equipment or service sales with lower margin customers  and the company s decision to aggressively price certain products and services 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increases are primarily the result of increase expenses due to acquisition of arc in july  a million increase in provision for doubtful accounts  million increase in non trade accounts receivable reserves and an increase of million in outside consultants fees associated with third quarter late filing and million recorded for write down of goodwill as discussed below 
expressed as a percentage of total net sales and service revenues  these expenses increased to in fiscal from for fiscal on a forward looking basis  the company expects to continue monitoring its selling  general and administrative expenses for strict cost controls 
restructuring and severance charges 
restructuring and severance charges reported were million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded severance charges totaling million resulting primarily from a re alignment of the organizational structure of the company 
additionally  during fiscal  the company recorded restructuring charges aggregating million due to unrecoverable assets related to the company s former wholly owned subsidiary  technology integration financial services tifs 
substantially all of the assets of tifs were sold in fiscal during fiscal  in connection with certain strategic initiatives  the company recorded restructuring and severance charges of million 
the restructuring charge is associated with costs of facilities and processes of pomeroy that have or will become duplicative or redundant as arc operations are integrated into the company 
the company also recorded a non recurring  one time charge for severance in the amount of million related to the resignation of david b 
pomeroy ii as ceo of the company 
david b 
pomeroy ii continues to serve as chairman of the board of the company 
write down of goodwill 
as part of its goodwill impairment testing  the company reviews various factors  such as the market price of the company s common stock  discounted cash flows from projected earnings and values for comparable companies to determine whether impairment exists 
the company has worked with a valuation firm to assess goodwill impairment and has determined there is impairment 
the primary factor leading to the impairment is the company s declining stock price in the fourth quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test is not yet complete 
therefore  the company has recognized a charge of million as a reasonable estimate of the impairment loss in its fiscal financial statements 
the actual impairment loss  once determined by the company  may differ significantly from this estimate 
any adjustment to this estimated impairment loss based on the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss will be recognized in the subsequent reporting period as a change in estimate 
income loss from operations 
income loss from operations decreased million  to a loss of million in fiscal from income of million in fiscal the company s operating margin decreased to a negative in fiscal as compared to a positive in fiscal this decrease is a result of the decrease in sales and in gross profit and the increase in operating expenses as described above 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal this increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of increased average borrowings under our credit facility relating to the arc acquisition 
income taxes 
income tax benefit was million during fiscal as compared to expense of million during fiscal this decrease was principally related to the loss recognized in fiscal net income loss 
net income decreased million  to a million net loss in fiscal from million net income in fiscal the decrease was a result of the factors described above 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net sales and revenues 
total net sales and revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was a result primarily of increased industry wide technology spending and the acquisition of alternative resources corporation arc on july  excluding the acquisition completed in fiscal year  total net sales and revenues increased 
gross profit 
gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the increase in service related revenues as a percentage of total revenues  which generally yields higher margins  due to the acquisition of alternative resources corporation and by the adoption of eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  in as a consequence of adopting eitf  the company recorded approximately thousand during fiscal of vendor considerations as a reduction of cost of sales  which would previously have been recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  the gross profit would have been during fiscal compared to during fiscal the non gaap gross profit margin is included in this discussion to provide meaningful comparison to prior periods 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses including rent expense and provision for doubtful accounts expressed as a percentage of total net sales and revenues increased to in fiscal from for fiscal total operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and revenues increased to in fiscal from for fiscal the increases are primarily the result of the acquisition of alternative resources corporation and recording a million restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal and the adoption of eitf offset by higher net sales and revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal on a forward looking basis  the company expects to continue monitoring its selling  general and administrative expenses for strict cost controls 
as noted above  as a result of adopting eitf  the company reclassified approximately thousand of vendor consideration to a reduction of cost of sales  which would previously have been recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  operating expenses would have been during fiscal as compared to during fiscal this non gaap measurement is included to provide a more meaningful comparison to prior periods

restructuring and severance charges 
restructuring and severance charges reported were million for fiscal during fiscal  in connection with certain strategic initiatives  the company recorded restructuring and severance charges of million 
the restructuring charge is associated with costs of facilities and processes of pomeroy that have or will become duplicative or redundant as arc operations are integrated into the company 
the company also recorded a non recurring  one time charge for severance in the amount of million related to the resignation of david b 
pomeroy ii as ceo of the company 
david b 
pomeroy ii continues to serve as chairman of the board of the company 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s operating margin remained constant in fiscal and at  primarily due to the increase in gross margin  offset by increase in operating expenses 
net interest income expense 
net interest expense was million during fiscal as compared to interest income of million during fiscal this increase in net interest expense was a result of increased borrowings under our credit facility relating to the arc acquisition and lower interest rates on invested funds 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was principally related to the increase in state and local income taxes 
net income 
net income increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal cash used in investing activities was million  which included million for acquisitions completed in prior years and million for capital expenditures 
cash used in financing activities was million which included million of payments on notes payable and short term borrowings  million for the purchase of treasury stock  and was offset by million from the exercise of stock options  and million proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan 
the amount of cash derived from operating activities will vary based on a number of business factors which may change from time to time  including terms of available financing from vendors  downturns in the company s business and or downturns in the businesses of the company s customers 
however  a growth or decline in services revenue in conjunction with a change in the proportion of services revenue to total revenue is an underlying driver of operating cash flow during the period of growth because a majority of the company s service revenue is generated based upon the billings of the company s technicians 
the cash outlay for these labor payroll costs is incurred bi weekly with each pay period 
the invoicing for the service is generated on various billing cycles as dictated by the customers  and the respective cash inflow typically follows within to days of invoice date  which may be as long as to days from the time the services are performed 
this differs from product revenue in that the time period between the time that the company incurs the cost to purchase the products and collects the revenue from its customer is typically shorter  usually from to days  and the company primarily orders inventory for a particular customer rather than stocking large amounts of inventory 
the company anticipates an increase in service revenue and in the proportion of service revenue to total revenue which  if it occurs  may result in a significant decrease in cash flows from operating activities during periods of significant growth or periods of excess technical capacity 
in addition  certain services  primarily outsourcing contracts for the company s life cycle services  require that the company maintain a specific parts inventory for servicing the customer  thus  an increase or decrease in the type of services provided can impact inventory levels and operating cash flows 
cash flows used in operating activities in fiscal were million as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from timing of payments on accounts payable  offset by a reduction in accounts receivable and inventories 
although working capital did not change significantly in as compared to  there were significant changes in certain accounts 
trade receivables decreased million primarily due to timing of payments from customers 
inventories decreased million due to the decline in business and to the use of parts built up in for outsourcing contracts requiring higher levels of committed service parts inventory 
accounts payable decreased million  primarily due to a decision to aggressively pursue cash discounts and to the decline in business 
other current liabilities increased million primarily as a result of increased accruals related to the use of subcontractors on new outsourcing contracts 
a significant part of pomeroy s inventories are financed by floor plan arrangements with third parties 
at january   these lines of credit totaled million  including million with ge commercial distribution finance gecdf and million with ibm credit corporation icc 
borrowings under the gecdf floor plan arrangements are made on thirty day notes 
the icc line of credit was reduced to million on march  borrowings under the icc floor plan arrangements are made on fifteen day notes 
all such borrowings are secured by the related inventory 
financing on substantially all of the arrangements is interest free due to subsidies by manufacturers 
overall  the average rate on these arrangements is less than 
the company classifies amounts outstanding under the floor plan arrangements as accounts payable 
on june   the company finalized a new million syndicated credit facility agreement with gecdf 
the credit facility has a three year term and its components include a maximum of million for inventory financing and a revolving line of credit  collateralized primarily by accounts receivable  of up to million  provided that the total amount outstanding at any time under the inventory financing facility and the revolving line of credit may not exceed million 
under the agreement  the credit facility provides a letter of credit facility of million 
under the credit facility  the interest rate is based on the london interbank offering rate libor and a pricing grid 
as of january  the adjusted libor rate was 
this credit facility expires june  at january  and  the company s balance outstanding under the credit facility was approximately and million  respectively 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of pomeroy  except those assets that collateralize certain other financing arrangements 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is subject to various financial covenants including maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum ratio of total funded indebtedness to ebitda  and a maximum net loss after tax 
due primarily to the write down of goodwill the company violated certain of its financial covenants  however  the company has received a waiver and as a result is not in default of its credit facility 
on july   the company and pomeroy acquisition sub  inc pas  a wholly owned subsidiary the company  completed a merger with alternative resources corporation arc 
on may   the parties entered into a definitive merger agreement for pas to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of arc 
the merger was approved by arc shareholders at a meeting held on july  as a result of the merger  arc is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the cash consideration paid at closing  including the cost of all stock  stock options and warrants purchased and the amount of arc net debt retired  was approximately million  which was funded from cash on hand and borrowings from pomeroy s existing line of credit 
pomeroy believes that the anticipated cash flow from operations and current financing arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy pomeroy s capital requirements for the next twelve months 
historically  pomeroy has financed acquisitions using a combination of cash  earn outs  shares of its common stock and seller financing 
pomeroy anticipates that future acquisitions will be financed in a similar manner 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations aggregated information about the company s contractual obligations as of january  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases      short term borrowings   floor plan arrangements   total contractual cash obligations      the operating leases  shown above  are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
operating leases are utilized in the normal course of business 
the expected timing or payment of obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
retains the general principle of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  that inventories are presumed to be stated at cost  however  it amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  sfas no 
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal production capacity 
the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that implementing sfas no 
should not have any material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first annual period beginning after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
sfas r will apply to awards granted or modified by the company after january  compensation cost will also be recorded for prior option grants that vest after that date 
the effect of adopting sfas r on the company s consolidated results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the fair value of the options granted at such future dates  as well as the vesting periods provided by such awards and  therefore  cannot currently be estimated 
for those options outstanding as of january   the company estimates the impact on the company s fiscal consolidated results of operations will be approximately million of expense 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab covers key topics related to the implementation of sfas r  including valuation models  expected volatility  expected option term  income tax effects  classification of stock based compensation cost  capitalization of compensation costs  and disclosure requirements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
this statement requires that an entity apply the retrospective method in reporting a change in an accounting principle of the reporting entity 
the standard only allows for a change in accounting principle if it is required by a newly issued accounting pronouncement or the entity can justify the use of an allowable alternative accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable 
this statement also requires that corrections for errors discovered in prior period financial statements be reported as a prior period adjustment by restating prior period financial statements 
additional disclosures are required when a change in accounting principle or reporting entity occurs  as well as when a correction for an error is reported 
sfas is effective for the company for fiscal no material impact is anticipated as a result of the adoption of this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its credit facility with gecdf 
currently  the company does not have any significant financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
