item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations general effects of seasonal weather conditions  the timing of rate increases  fluctuations in demand due to the cost of fuel passed on to customers and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season all have an impact on income 
recent price increases in natural and propane gas  in part as a result of the effects of hurricane katrina on gas supplies  may have lowered energy use in the later part of and could affect future demand and net operating income 
for  we have an over earnings liability for our natural gas segment because our rate of return exceeds the maximum rate of return allowed by the fpsc 
at december    was recorded as an over earnings liability subject to fpsc review 
for more information on this liability  see outlook  over earnings natural gas segment  below 
also in october  the fpsc approved recovery of natural gas storm costs plus interest over a month period beginning november we had deferred our storm costs as a regulatory asset on our balance sheet to be paid by customers 
the fpsc also approved recovery of expenses associated with requesting and evaluating proposals for the electric fuel contracts and the associated negotiation of these contracts 
the fpsc disallowed recovery of expenses relating to a requested surcharge and ordered amortization of these costs over a five year period beginning  january  the surcharge was requested to help mitigate the future impact of revised fuel contracts 
see outlook  electric power supply contracts below 
revenues and gross profit revenues include normal sales revenues  along with cost recovery revenues 
the fpsc allows cost recovery revenues to directly recover costs of fuel  conservation and revenue based taxes in our natural gas and electric segments 
revenues collected for these expenses have no effect on result of operations and fluctuations could distort the relationship of revenues between periods 
because gross profit eliminates these cost recovery revenues  we believe it provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility revenues revenues and gross profit dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold one thousand dekatherms mdth electric revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mega watt hours mwh propane gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold one thousand dekatherms mdth natural gas natural gas revenues increased million in over primarily due to an million increase in cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
the cost of natural gas increased significantly over prior years  partially as a result of recent hurricanes and their impact on supplies 
gross profit increased million  or  primarily as a result of rate relief effective in november  normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
natural gas revenues increased million in over primarily due to a million increase in cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
gross profit increased  or 
the primary reason for the gross profit increase was the interim rate relief beginning in august and a final increase effective november as well as normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
a million fee received in but not in offset the increase in gross profit 
electric electric revenues increased million in over cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers contributed million of the increase 
gross profit increased  or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a increase in units sold along with the rate increases granted in march a large distribution center was built recently in our northwest division and increased revenues by approximately  and gross profit by approximately  in over electric revenues increased million in over million of the increase was for the cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
gross profit increased million or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the rate increases granted in march  along with normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
propane gas propane revenues increased million and gross profit increased million or in compared to the company realized gains of approximately  as a result of buying propane supplies before market price increases 
the remaining increase of from the previous year resulted from propane unit sales increasing due primarily to a growth in residential bulk customers and units sold 
propane revenues increased million and gross profit increased  or in compared to additionally  approximately  of the gross profit increase in over is attributable to a refinement of propane inventory estimate that lowered gross profit in the third quarter of propane unit sales increased due primarily to the addition of a large wholesale customer along with an increase in the total number of customers in operating expenses operating expenses include operation  maintenance  depreciation  amortization and taxes other than income taxes  and exclude fuel costs  conservation and taxes based on revenues that are directly passed through to customers and recovered in revenues 
operating expenses dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas natural gas natural gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with amortization expense increased  the bare steel replacement program and recovery of future environmental costs approved in our natural gas rate proceeding were the primary reasons for this increase 
we are currently under a year program to replace all bare steel mains and service lines with coated steel and polyethylene pe lines 
we have received approval to recover the funds necessary to replace these mains and services over the year period 
pursuant to an fpsc mandate  we accrue for amortization expense as an offset to the revenues received  and record a contribution to the related construction expenditures 
the fpsc also approved recovery of our expected environmental liability over a year period 
based on our strategic plan  we have increased efforts in our customer service area to respond to customers 
customer account expense increased  primarily due to increased payroll expenses for additional staffing and facility and equipment upgrades 
there were also increased bad debt expenses as a result of the increases in accounts receivable due to general and fuel rate increases 
the purchase of additional safety equipment  tools  hardware and office furniture contributed to a  increase in other operating expense 
other items affecting expenses included a research marketing study to provide us with data to better serve our customers and additional payroll expenses relating to hurricane preparedness and wage increases 
maintenance expense increased by  primarily due to maintenance expenditures in central florida for cleaning and painting a distribution regulator and gate stations and the purchase of maintenance related safety equipment and tools 
natural gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to an increase in plant assets and customer account expense increased  the increase in customer account expense in over was primarily due to a reduction  in the first quarter of  of operating expenses because of a  recovery of bad debt related to the contract with lake worth generation 
other operating expense increased  partially due to an increase in underground natural gas line location expense of  that was caused by an increase in the quantity of natural gas line locations performed due to construction related projects 
the increase was offset by a decrease of  in maintenance expenses in the first quarter of related to an abandoned construction project for a main insertion failure at royal park bridge in south florida 
electric electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as we continue to focus on improving service reliability  we increased maintenance expense by  for additional tree trimming and the use of a temporary mobile substation while a new transformer was purchased and put into service 
depreciation expense increased  due to normal increases in plant assets 
in  other operating expenses increased  due to a shift from work on capital assets to operational needs along with personnel raises 
electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with maintenance increased  primarily due to increased maintenance requiring subcontractor involvement in maintenance projects more costly than in house labor and  increase in tree trimming expense due to additional tree trimming activities that were needed to properly maintain line clearances and reduce potential outages 
customer account expense increased  propane gas propane gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as we continued to focus on increasing our propane business  other operating costs increased  we placed additional emphasis in the sales area  which resulted in signing up new housing developments that will utilize propane gas 
we incurred increased expenditures for piping homes  delivering propane  implementing a new delivery system and increasing commission payments 
this increased effort in our sales area contributed to an increase of customers and overall units sold in our propane segment 
propane gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with other operating expenses increased  depreciation expense also increased  due to increases in plant assets 
uncollectible accounts increased  due to increased accounts receivable 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased  or  in over these expenses are related to all of our operating segments 
pension expense increased  due to our estimate that the return on the pension s assets will not keep pace with growing pension liabilities 
in an effort to manage future expected increases in the pension liabilities  we decided to discontinue eligibility to our defined benefit pension plan for new employees 
we replaced the defined benefit pension plan with a k match plan for new employees 
medical insurance premiums continue to rise  increasing  in compliance costs related to sarbanes oxley and internal control requirements  as well as audit fees  increased outside services expenses by  with the impacts from our focus on hurricane preparations and the recent hurricanes  our safety expense increased by  a portion of this increase related to an additional safety employee and a new safety incentive program 
administrative expenses shared by all of our operating segments increased  or  in over pension expense increased  due to the performance of the investments in the pension plan 
insurance increased  primarily due to increased medical costs 
amortization of electric rate case expense began in april and increased expense by  we had accumulated charges earlier in relating to a potential equity offering 
due to market conditions and our ability to increase the line of credit to address cash needs  we cancelled the potential equity offering in july accumulated charges of approximately  were expensed in july this was more than offset by a decrease in outside services primarily due to a change in external auditors 
total other income and deductions other income and deductions consists of revenues and expenses from our merchandise sales and services  gains or losses on disposal of property  interest expense and other miscellaneous income or expenses 
the largest components of this section are merchandise sales and services income  and interest expense 
our services activities include installation of merchandise and other contract work 
interest expense consists of interest on bonds  short term borrowings and customer deposits 
merchandise and services revenues and expenses merchandise and services revenues and expenses both increased in from but merchandise profitability decreased  we experienced an increase in revenues and cost of sales primarily due to an increased demand for electric to gas conversions and installations of customer owned propane tanks to supply back up generators 
we had increased expenses from sub contractors that were not passed on to customers in sales prices 
management is currently reviewing the profitability of the various merchandise installation costs and considering increasing installation fees to improve profitability in this area 
merchandise and service revenue and expenses both increased in from  however merchandise profitability decreased  primarily due to increased expenses from sub contractors on increased installations and service 
interest expenses in  total interest expense increased  interest on short term debt increased  this was due to the increase in the average outstanding loan balance on the line of credit and higher interest rates 
we also made an interest payment of  as the result of the irs audit of prior years tax returns 
interest on customer deposits increased  due to increased customer deposits primarily as a result of additional deposits required after implementing increased rates in our natural gas operation 
in  total interest expense decreased  from primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on short term debt resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding loan balance on the line of credit 
other non operating income increased by  in from largely due to  additional interest income associated with the sale of the water assets 
this was offset by a  adjustment in required by the fpsc to move environmental interest income to the environmental liability reserve 
income taxes income tax expense decreased in over the normal tax rate on net income by  tax return adjustments related to the sale of water and the regulatory deferred tax liabilities decreased expenses by  we had an offsetting increase of  related to our irs audit of the and income tax returns 
discontinued operations see note  discontinued operations for additional information regarding the sale of water in and the effects on the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources summary of primary sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands year ended december  sources of cash operating activities  including working capital changes proceeds from issuance of short term debt proceeds from sale of water plant other sources of cash uses of cash construction expenditures repayment of short term debt dividends paid other uses of cash net source use of cash cash flows operating activities net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities decreased in by approximately million compared to payments for fuel exceeded the amount collected from customers by an additional million in the under recovery of fuel costs are collected in the following calendar year 
income tax payments increased approximately million  primarily as a result of less tax depreciation and higher income 
the deduction for tax depreciation was higher in both and as a result of bonus depreciation  resulting in lower taxes in those years 
we also received a refund in relating to the deferral of the gain on our water assets sale 
offsetting the decreases to cash flow was additional cash received from rate increases in our natural gas segment 
the rate increases also contributed to an increase to accounts receivable of million 
accounts payable increased million primarily due to the increased cost of fuel in our natural gas segment 
net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities increased in by approximately million from the increase was primarily due to the receipt of a million estimated tax payment refund received in this refund was primarily due to the deferral of the gain for tax purposes on the sale of the water division in a million estimated tax payment made in related to the gain on the sale of the water division 
it was subsequently determined that the income tax would be deferred see note  discontinued operations 
we applied for a refund and received million in july  which included other estimated tax overpayments 
investing activities construction expenditures decreased in compared to by approximately million 
in  there were large projects to rebuild two substations in our electric segment and additional propane community gas systems costing approximately million 
in such expenditures were lower and consisted of the purchase of a transformer in our electric segment for approximately  a new natural gas mapping system to track our assets used in serving our customers for approximately  a propane delivery system for approximately  an additional propane community gas system for approximately  and other various capital expenditures 
construction expenditures increased million through december compared to december construction in increased approximately million from rebuilding two substations in the electric segment 
in addition  approximately  was spent on additional propane community gas systems 
financing activities although additional sources of cash were provided by our recent rate increases and lower construction expenditures in  the additional expenditures from under recovery of fuel costs and additional income taxes slightly increased our short term debt 
short term borrowings increased in over by approximately million 
proceeds from the sale of the water assets of million added to cash in these proceeds were primarily used to pay off short term debt in capital resources we currently have a million line of credit loc  which expires on june  upon days notice by us we can increase the loc to a maximum of million 
the loc contains affirmative and negative covenants that  if violated  would give the bank the right to accelerate the due date of the loan to be immediately payable 
the covenants include certain financial ratios 
all ratios are currently exceeded and management believes we are in full compliance with all covenants and anticipates continued compliance 
we reserve million of the loc to cover expenses for any major storm repairs in our electric segment and an additional  for a letter of credit insuring propane facilities 
as of december   the amount borrowed from the loc was million 
the loc  long term debt and preferred stock as of december  comprised of total capitalization and debt 
in prior years we periodically paid off short term borrowings under lines of credit using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
we may use similar types of proceeds in the future to pay off short term borrowings  dependent on the amount borrowed from the loc  prevailing market conditions for debt and equity  the impact to our financial covenants and the effect on income 
our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  which is a mortgage on all real and personal property  permits the issuance of additional bonds based upon a calculation of unencumbered net real and personal property 
at december   such calculation would permit the issuance of approximately million of additional bonds 
on october  we received approval from the fpsc to issue and sell or exchange an additional amount of million in any combination of long term debt  short term notes and equity securities and or to assume liabilities or obligations as guarantor  endorser or surety during calendar year we have million in invested funds held for payment of future environmental costs 
we expect to use some of these funds in capital requirements portions of our business are seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in florida 
this factor affects the sale of electricity and gas and impacts the cash provided by operations 
construction costs also impact cash requirements throughout the year 
cash needs for operations and construction are met partially through short term borrowings from our loc 
construction expenditures are expected to be higher in compared to by approximately million 
the primary reason for the expected increase in expenditures is the anticipated purchase of land for a new south florida division office 
the current division office is on environmentally impacted property  which requires relocating the office to another location to allow for clean up of the property 
it will not be possible to rebuild at the current location since the property has been rezoned with a residential designation 
the estimated cost of land is million to million 
we are planning to build and complete this new facility in the next five years 
the other expected construction expenditures in are expected to be slightly higher than construction expenditures in 
we do not currently have any material commitments for construction expenditures in other than vehicles of approximately  we are currently testing a transformer in our northeast division  and based on the results of the tests  we may be required to either repair or replace this transformer 
the estimated cost of repair is approximately  to  if replacement is required  the cost is expected to be approximately  based upon the results  repairs or replacement would be expected to occur in the second half of in addition  cash requirements might increase significantly in the future due to environmental clean up costs  sinking fund payments on long term debt and pension contributions 
environmental clean up is forecast to require payments of approximately million in  with remaining payments which could total approximately million beginning in annual long term debt sinking fund payments of approximately million will begin in and will continue for eleven years 
current projections indicate that we will need to make annual contributions in our defined benefit pension plan of  in and  in these estimates are based on funding laws as of january  contribution amounts in and beyond will likely be affected by pending funding reform that congress is currently considering whic h would increase those funding requirements 
based on our current expectations for cash needs  including cash needs relating to the possible land purchase and related construction  we may choose to consider an equity or debt financing in of million to million to address those cash needs 
the need and timing will depend upon operational requirements  environmental expenditures  pension contributions and construction expenditures and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 
in addition  if we experience significant environmental expenditures in the next two or three years it is possible we may need to raise additional funds as early as we may consider equity or debt offerings for any such additional financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that equity or debt financing will be available on favorable terms  or at a ll  in or later years when the company is seeking such financings 
outlook pension and insurance expenses pension and insurance costs have been and are expected to continue to increase 
pension expenses increased in by  and current actuarial estimates show pension expense will increase an additional  in pension expenses are projected to continue increasing in insurance expenses including medical  liability and workers compensation  increased by  in and are expected to increase further in the regulated segments have received rate relief for some of the expected pension and insurance increases 
increases beyond those experienced through and  which are allocated to the regulated segments  may require requesting future rate relief 
the propane segment may recover these expenses by increasing rates depending on market conditions in the propane industry and the ability to remain competitive 
due to significant cost increases for our defined benefit pension plan over the past three years and with expectations that these cost increases will continue in the years ahead  we discontinued eligibility to our pension plan for all new non union hires effective january  and are phasing out the plan for new union members 
five of our six union contracts have accepted this change for their new union members  and we intend to negotiate this issue in the remaining union contract in june of for those new hires no longer eligible for the defined benefit pension plan  we have established a k plan with match contributions 
the k provides a company match of cents for every dollar contributed by an employee on the first of their salary  for a total annual company contribution of up to 
the employees are eligible for the company match after six months of continuous service  with vesting of after three years of continuous service 
electric power supply contracts contracts with our two electric suppliers expire december  the contracts currently provide electricity to our customers at rates that are much lower than market rates 
the savings are passed through to our customers without profit to the company 
obtaining supply contracts at below market prices will not reoccur 
we expect a substantial increase between our current contract prices and the anticipated contract prices 
we have entered into negotiations with suppliers to be our ongoing electricity suppliers 
during  we anticipate completion of final contracts for the supply of our electricity beginning january  we are unable to estimate what impact  if any  higher rates could have on electric consumption 
in december the fpsc approved recovery of expenses associated with requesting and evaluating proposals for the fuel contracts and the associated negotiation of the contracts 
as of december    was included in the fuel charges that will be passed through to electric customers 
the company requested a fuel surcharge to help mitigate the future price increases expected in the fpsc disallowed the fuel surcharge and disallowed the related administrative expenses associated with this request for recovery through the fuel clause 
as of december    was deferred and  with fpsc approval  will be amortized to operating expenses over five years beginning january  propane we currently have propane advance purchase agreements at close to current market price 
the purchase of propane gas under these agreements in the first quarter of is not expected to provide an increase to the gross profit in our propane segment 
the realization of any additional gross profit depends on market conditions affecting the cost of propane over the first quarter of these advance purchase agreements are made in the normal course of procuring propane supplies 
similar agreements provided additional gross profit of approximately  in and  in management is currently performing a comprehensive review of the propane segment for additional ways to reduce expenses and increase revenues 
these revenues or savings  if any  would be realized during over earnings natural gas segment the fpsc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment and limits the maximum amount of earnings of regulated operations 
we have estimated that we will have over earnings in of  this liability has been included in an over earnings liability on our balance sheet  with the potential of rate refunds to customers 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
we believe our estimate of our over earnings liabilities is accurate  but it could change upon the fpsc finalization and review of our earnings 
the fpsc determines the disposition of over earnings with alternatives that include refunding to customers  funding storm damage or environmental reserves  or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
recently  the fpsc ordered natural gas over earnings of approximately  to be added to our regulatory liability storm reserve to cover future storm costs 
finalization of the disposition and determination of the amount of natural gas over earnings is expected in the amount of natural gas over earnings for was primarily a result of delayed and cancelled capital projects  reduced area expansion amortization and slightly higher sales units and customers than projected 
the delayed and cancelled capital projects contributed significantly to the lower than expected increase in depreciation expenses in our natural gas segment 
operating expenses  with the exception of the depreciation and amortization  were close to expectations 
since this was the first year of our full rate relief in our natural gas operations and the rate relief covered expected levels of expenses and units sold  these items impacted the amount of over earnings liability and did not affect net operating results 
electric customers a large commercial customer in our electric division will be closing its operations by late as a result we anticipate annual revenues to be reduced by approximately  and annual gross profit to be reduced by approximately  in  a large distribution center was built in our northwest division and a distribution park is under construction in this same area 
a third distribution facility is near completion 
additional industrial and commercial development is planned for this general area  which should increase load significantly 
additional gross profit is anticipated in the future to increase between  and  as a result of this additional development 
indiantown gas agreement we have signed a letter of intent and are in negotiations for a natural gas territorial agreement with indiantown gas for a location adjacent to and within its service area 
the fpsc is aware of and supports this agreement 
significant residential development is planned for indiantown in martin county 
we plan to transport natural gas through indiantown s system to new developments 
in the early phase  indiantown gas will provide operational and customer service related work 
development is expected to begin in we do not anticipate any significant increase in the number of customers or revenues during  but both should increase as the development continues 
early estimates for this area indicate the number of customers may increase by  over the next ten years 
lake worth utilities the city of lake worth formed a task force to review their electric utility in december one option that the task force is reviewing is the possible sale of the city of lake worth s electric generation plant 
if sold  and if the gas transportation agreement between our company and the city of lake worth is terminated  the city will be obligated to pay our company the amount of our undepreciated investment in our gas facilities serving the city of lake worth plus any costs incurred by our company to abandon the gas facilities 
if this agreement is terminated in  the city of lake worth will have to pay us approximately million plus the costs of abandonment 
in addition  it is possible that the natural gas transportation sales through this pipeline to the electric generation facility could cease 
our revenues and gross profit from the city of lake worth would decrease annually by approximately  contractual obligations table of contractual obligations dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations long term debt interest operating lease obligations natural gas and propane purchase obligations electric purchase obligations other purchase obligations total long term debt the long term debt obligations are principal amounts 
operating leases our total operating lease obligation is  we are leasing property from the city of fernandina beach in our northeast division 
the total obligation for the duration of this lease is about  over the next five years 
we are in the process of renegotiating the terms of this lease and may be able to terminate this lease at an earlier date 
we lease our appliance showroom in the same division for approximately  annually 
we also have other operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates 
purchase obligations a purchase order is considered an obligation if it is associated with a contract or is authorizing a specific purchase of material 
the other purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of purchase orders considered an obligation 
pension  medical postretirement and other obligations our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations  however  under current actuarial assumptions contributions may be required as early as actuarial forecasts estimate a contribution may be required of  in and  in contribution amounts beyond may be affected by pending funding reform congress is considering 
environmental clean up is anticipated to require approximately million in  the remainder to be paid in the following years 
we have medical postretirement payments relating to retiree medical insurance 
these payments are not included in the above table 
estimated future payments are contained in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have historically paid dividends 
it is our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future

sfas no 
also requires that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon retirement  whether legal asset retirement obligations or not  be removed from a company s accumulated depreciation reserve 
we adopted the provisions of the statement as of january   as prescribed by the fpsc 
under f psc guidelines  the estimated cost of removal expenses for normal retirements related to regulated fixed assets were reserved through the depreciation expense and accumulated reserves 
this was disclosed in a footnote until december   when the estimated cost of removal from accumulated depreciation was reclassified to a regulatory liability for the obligation 
this interpretation addresses the legal obligation to retire an asset when the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company

sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation and it is our most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues or expenses 
sfas no 
does not apply to our unregulated propane gas operations 
use of estimates we are required to use estimates in preparing our financial statements so they will be in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the accruals for potential liabilities are adequate 
we use estimates including the accrual for pensions  environmental liabilities  over earnings liability  unbilled revenues  uninsured liability claims  and the regulatory deferred income tax liability 
pension an actuary calculates the estimated pension liability in accordance with fasb environmental liabilities these liabilities are subject to certain unknown future events 
over earnings liability this liability is subject to regulatory review and possible disallowance of some expenses in determining the amount of over earnings 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenue is estimated with certain assumptions including unaccounted for units and the use of current month sales to estimate unbilled sales 
uninsured liability claims we are self insured for the first  of each general and auto liability claim and accrue for estimated losses occurring from both asserted and unasserted claims 
the estimate for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents is based on an analysis of historical claims data and judgment 
until january   we were self insured for medical claims and required accruals of estimated claims 
regulatory deferred income tax liability this liability is estimated based on historical data and is subject to finalization of our income tax return 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition we bill utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
we accrue estimated revenue for gas and electric customers for consumption used but not yet billed for in an accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates and historical data 
we believe that the estimates for unbilled revenue materially reflect the unbilled gross profit for our customers for units used but not yet billed in the current period 
the fpsc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment and limits the maximum amount of earnings of regulated operations 
any earnings in excess of this maximum amount  is accrued for as an over earnings liability  and revenues are reduced for this same amount 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
the fpsc determines the disposition of any over earnings with alternatives that include refunding to customers  funding storm damage or environmental reserves  or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
effects of inflation our tariffs for natural gas and electric operations provide for fuel clauses that adjust annually for changes in the cost of fuel 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses and any effect on unregulated propane gas operations 
environmental matters we currently use or have used in the past  several contamination sites that are currently involved in pending or threatened environmental litigation  see note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend our rights in this litigation 
we have insurance and rate relief to cover any expected losses or expenses 
we believe that the aggregate of all future contamination assessment and remedial costs  legal fees and other related expenses would not exceed the insurance proceeds received and any rate relief granted 
the final natural gas rate relief granted by the fpsc provided future recovery of million for environmental liabilities 
the remaining balance to be recovered from customers through future recovery is included on the balance sheet as  other regulatory assets environmental 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

forward looking statements cautionary statement this report contains forward looking statements including those relating to the following expectations based on our current expectations for cash needs  including cash needs relating to the possible land purchase and related construction  we may choose to consider an equity or debt financing in of million to million to address those cash needs 
the need and timing will depend upon operational requirements  environmental expenditures  pension contributions and construction expenditures and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 
pension expenses will continue to increase in other insurance costs will increase in our over earnings liability in natural gas will materialize as estimated after the fpsc review and audit 
we expect to have higher fuel costs for and beyond 
the development in indiantown will occur as estimated and we will provide natural gas to this area 
the purchase of land for our new natural gas and propane division office will occur in the commercial and industrial growth will occur as expected in our northwest division providing increases in our revenues and gross profit 
the loss of the large commercial customer in our northwest division will occur in lake worth utilities could be sold and our agreement with them for facilities may be terminated 
a payment for this termination including abandonment costs would occur and lost revenues could materialize from the loss of service to this customer 
these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to those set forth above in risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by us were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
we have market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates 
we have no material exposure relating to commodity prices because under our regulatory jurisdictions  we are fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities natural gas and electricity used in our operations 
any commodity price increases for propane gas are normally passed through monthly to propane gas customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
none of our gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of our contracts meet the definition of a derivative  we have designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have no exposure to equity risk  as we do not hold any equity instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs  the water sale long term receivable and short term borrowings on the line of credit 
the investments held for environmental costs are short term fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
the short term borrowings were million at the end of december therefore  we do not believe we have material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the indentures governing our two first mortgage bond series outstanding contain make whole provisions  which are pre payment penalties that charge for lost interest  which render refinancing impracticable 
our long term receivable non interest bearing from the sale of the water operations was discounted at 
a hypothetical basis points increase in the interest rate used would change the current fair value from million to million 
in  a hypothetical basis points decrease in the long term interest rate on million debt excluding unamortized debt discount would change the fair value from million to million 
changes in short term interest rates could have an effect on income depending on the balance borrowed on the variable rate line of credit 
we had short term debt of million on december  and million on december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings for by  and for by  based on year end borrowings
