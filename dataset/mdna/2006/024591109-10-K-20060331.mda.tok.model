item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations american biltrite s consolidated financial statements include its majority owned subsidiary  congoleum 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  congoleum filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
in november  congoleum filed a modified plan of reorganization and related documents with the bankruptcy court reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee  the future claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures in december and congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of the modified plan 
in april  congoleum announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee and the future claimants representative to make certain modifications to its proposed plan of reorganization and related documents governing the settlement and payment of asbestos related claims against congoleum 
under the agreed upon modifications  asbestos claimants with claims settled under congoleum s pre petition settlement agreements would agree to forbear from exercising the security interest they were granted and share on a pari passu basis with all other present and future asbestos claimants in insurance proceeds and other assets of the plan trust 
in july  congoleum filed the sixth plan and related documents with the bankruptcy court which reflected the agreed upon modifications as well as other technical modifications 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and voting procedures and congoleum commenced solicitation of acceptances of the sixth plan in august in september  congoleum learned that certain asbestos claimants were unwilling to agree to forbear from exercising their security interest as contemplated by the sixth plan and the sixth plan was subsequently withdrawn 
in november  the bankruptcy court denied a request to extend congoleum s exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization and solicit acceptances thereof 
in february  congoleum filed the seventh plan 
on february   congoleum announced its intention to make additional changes to its plan of reorganization  and on march  it filed the eighth plan 
in addition  an insurance company has filed the cna plan and the official committee of bondholders has filed the bondholder plan 
the bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing to consider the adequacy of the disclosure statements with respect to these plans for april  there can be no assurance that congoleum will obtain approval to solicit acceptances for the eighth plan  that congoleum will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation of the eighth plan  that the eighth plan will not be modified further  that the eighth plan will receive necessary court approvals from the bankruptcy court or the federal district court  or that such approvals will be received in a timely fashion  that the eighth plan will be confirmed  or that the eighth plan  if confirmed  will become effective 
it is unclear whether the bankruptcy court will approve the cna plan or the bondholder plan or whether either of such plans  if confirmed  would be feasible 
moreover  it is unclear whether any other person will attempt to propose a plan or what any such plan would provide or propose  and whether the bankruptcy court would approve a plan other than congoleum s proposed plan 
furthermore  the eighth plan  if confirmed and effective  will result in significant dilution of abi s ownership of congoleum 
congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and related matters and are expected to file objections to the eighth plan 
certain other parties have also filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and may file objections to the eighth plan 
congoleum expects that the terms of the eighth plan may be amended or modified as a result of further negotiations with various parties 
the terms of the cna plan and the bondholder plan are materially different from the terms of the eighth plan  and these plans may also be amended  modified  or may be withdrawn 
there can be no assurance that the terms of the reorganization plan that is ultimately confirmed  if any  will not materially differ from the terms of the eighth plan 
congoleum expects that it will take until some time in the fourth quarter of at the earliest to obtain confirmation of any plan of reorganization 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos personal injury claimants the claimant agreement  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  congoleum also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement and granting the collateral trust a security interest in congoleum s rights under its applicable insurance coverage and payments from congoleum s insurers for asbestos claims 
in december  congoleum commenced an avoidance action seeking to void the security interest granted to the collateral trust 
under the terms of the eighth plan  asbestos personal injury claimants voting to accept the plan would irrevocably consent or would be deemed to have irrevocably consented to the forbearance of claim and any lien rights related to the claimant agreement 
under the terms of the eighth plan  after the establishment of the plan trust  the assets in the collateral trust would be transferred to the plan trust and any claims subject to the claimant agreement would be channeled to the plan trust and paid in accordance with the terms of the eighth plan 
settlement values under the eighth plan may differ from values under the sixth plan and the claimant agreement  which  together with the outcome of litigation regarding the enforceability of the claimant agreement and security interest  may materially affect the liability associated with the asbestos personal injury claims against congoleum 
as a result of tabulating ballots on congoleum s fourth modified plan of reorganization  congoleum is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in the sixth plan 
based on the contemplated eighth plan  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through the plan trust 
congoleum recorded charges aggregating approximately million in prior years and a further approximately million in  to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the eighth plan or any other plan of reorganization could be materially higher than currently recorded 
congoleum may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
delays in proposing  filing and obtaining approval of the eighth plan or any new amended plan of reorganization  or the continued pursuit of alternative plans of reorganization by certain insurers  the official committee of bondholders or other parties in interest  could result in a proceeding that takes longer and is more costly than congoleum has estimated 
abi estimates that it will spend an additional thousand for legal fees and its anticipated contribution to the plan trust of thousand in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan  which it has accrued 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust by congoleum and abi and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
under the terms of the eighth plan  congoleum would issue million new shares of class a common stock that would reduce abi s economic interest in congoleum from approximately at present to approximately on a fully diluted basis 
abi s voting interest would be reduced from approximately at present to approximately on a fully diluted basis 
congoleum would also issue a convertible security that  upon certain events of default  would convert into million shares of class a common stock  further diluting abi s economic interest and resulting in a loss of voting control by abi 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
due to congoleum s reorganization and separate capital structure  the company believes that presenting abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations abi and non debtor subsidiaries in thousands of dollars net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    selling  general administrative expenses    operating income    interest expense  net    other income  net    income before taxes and other items  provision for income taxes  noncontrolling interests income loss from continuing operations  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from sales of million in tape segment sales increased due to increased volume and selling price increases  with all product lines contributing to the increase 
canadian segment sales increased on increased sales of flooring and industrial products coupled with the result of foreign currency translation 
jewelry segment sales declined to the mass merchandiser channel primarily due to a product strategy change by a major customer  which resulted in lost business and additional markdowns 
while the number of sku s for this customer under its new strategy is comparable to the number of sku s for this customer before it adopted its new strategy  it is too early to determine the effect on future sales 
lower sales to mid tier retailers due to fewer programs also contributed to the decline 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in gross margins in the tape segment improved points as a percentage of net sales due to higher selling prices and increased volume  which mitigated increases in raw material costs and other expenses 
canadian segment gross margins were level with the prior year as margin increases in flooring products were offset by lower margins on industrial sales 
margins in the jewelry business declined points as a percentage of net sales due to the effect of markdowns and higher product costs which could not be recovered in pricing 
the decline in jewelry sales  which is the highest margin segment  as a percent of total sales  also contributed to the overall margin decline 
the company includes the cost of purchasing and finished goods inspection in selling  general and administrative expenses 
some companies also record such costs in operating expenses while others record them in cost of goods sold 
consequently  the company s gross profit margins may not be comparable to other companies 
had the company recorded these expenses in cost of sales  the gross profit margins for the years ended december  and have been and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  down from million in during  abi entered into a settlement agreement with one of its insurance carriers 
the settlement resolved disputes regarding the carrier s coverage obligations for environmental liability defense and indemnity costs at certain sites where abi  as a result of activities conducted many years ago  is alleged to have damaged property 
as a result of this settlement  abi received million in cash  which reduced selling  general and administrative expenses and accounted for the majority of the decrease from to also contributing to the decrease was a significant decline in professional fees in connection with the congoleum reorganization and modification of the company s debt agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased 
million  primarily due to increased freight costs and inflation on salaries and benefits  offset by expense reduction initiatives 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from of net sales in to of net sales in net interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to a decrease in the leverage fee under the company s note agreement governing its outstanding million aggregate principal amount notes 
interest rates on the company s revolving credit facility were slightly higher in compared with  but average borrowings were lower 
other income increased from million in to million in as a result of income from the sale of a warehouse in for million after expenses partly offset by a thousand decrease in management fees paid by congoleum to abi from to the impact of the warehouse sale on the company s net income after taxes and non controlling interest was thousand  or per share 
the effective tax rate in of arises primarily from the company s ability to recognize certain tax benefits not previously recognized  coupled with the effect of combining various segments with differing statutory rates 
future effective tax rates are expected to be closer to statutory rates  but could fluctuate widely depending on the actual and relative results of individual segments  as well as other factors 
income from continuing operations was million in  compared with a loss of thousand in this improvement was largely due to the sale of the warehouse and insurance settlement in net income was million in compared with a net loss of million in reflecting the improved results from continuing operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from sales of million in tape segment sales increased as volume  and to a lesser extent product mix  improved worldwide  sales of paper  film and hvac products were up while automotive product sales decreased 
canadian segment sales increased as a result of foreign currency translation  and higher industrial product sales offset lower flooring sales 
jewelry segment sales were essentially level as decreased sales to the mass merchandiser channel and lower service revenues were offset by growth in sales to department stores  and specialty and mid tier retailers 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in gross margins in the tape segment declined point as a percentage of net sales due to higher raw material costs 
canadian segment margins improved points as a percentage of net sales as improved manufacturing performance and spending reductions more than offset higher raw material costs 
margins in the jewelry business improved points as a percentage of net sales on a more profitable customer mix 
the company includes the cost of purchasing and finished goods inspection in selling  general and administrative expenses 
some companies also record such costs in operating expenses while others record them in cost of goods sold 
consequently  the company s gross profit margins may not be comparable to other companies 
had the company recorded these expenses in cost of sales  the gross profit margins for the years ended december  and have been and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  up from million in  as a result of higher employee benefit costs and freight and selling expense increases 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from of net sales in to of net sales in net interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher interest rates under certain of the company s debt agreements 
the effective tax rate in of arises primarily from combining profitable segments providing for taxes at higher statutory rates with unprofitable segments whose resulting tax benefits are at lower statutory rates 
furthermore  the canadian division recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from its losses 
future effective tax rates are expected to be closer to statutory rates  but could fluctuate widely depending on the actual and relative results of individual segments  as well as other factors 
the loss from continuing operations was thousand in  compared with thousand in  as improved income from operations was offset by higher interest and taxes and less favorable net foreign exchange gains losses 
the net loss was million in compared with a net loss of million in when the charges related to the closure of the janus flooring operations were recognized

the increase in sales resulted primarily from the impact of selling price increases instituted in late and during of net sales  increased sales of residential tile up million and higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry reflecting post hurricane demand for both manufactured housing and rv homes 
this was partially offset by a sales decrease of do it yourself tile reflecting the loss of a major mass merchandiser customer coupled with decreased demand for residential sheet specials 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margins was driven by the sharp increase in raw material pricing which increased costs by of net sales  a less favorable product mix which reduced gross margin by of net sales  and the negative impact of lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs of net sales 
this was partially mitigated by price increases instituted during late and of net sales  lower warranty claims expense of net sales and the favorable impact of manufacturing cost reduction programs initiated of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses were down million of net sales reflecting cost savings initiatives instituted in late  including workforce reductions and related benefits million and the impact of lower unit sales volume on freight and other incentive programs million 
asbestos related charges in were million  compared to million in congoleum recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that congoleum would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization 
if congoleum is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the eighth plan also would require congoleum to make additional contributions to the plan trust comprised of approximately million in cash  million shares of newly issued congoleum class a common stock and a newly issued convertible security 
the redemption or principal value of the convertible security will be increased one year after confirmation of the plan to the amount  if any  by which of the value of congoleum s shares at that time exceeds approximately million 
no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution  which could be material 
congoleum will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the convertible security will require congoleum to make dividend or interest payments prior to such security s redemption or maturity date 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the same period in the prior year  a decline of million 
this decline in operating income reflects the charges for asbestos related claims taken in  coupled with lower gross margins  partially offset by reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was million  which was million higher than the prior year reflecting higher cash balances and interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the interest accrued on the unpaid interest on its senior notes 
due to the chapter proceedings  congoleum was precluded from making the interest payments due february   august   february  and august  on the senior notes 
congoleum recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in  and it also recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which congoleum has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales resulted from the effect of selling price increases initiated during and higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry partially offset by declines in do it yourself tile sales to mass merchandisers and less demand for residential sheet specials 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in gross margins were driven by the impact of the price increase of net sales  improvement in product mix due to a high end residential sheet introduction of net sales coupled with improved manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost reduction programs initiated during the second half of of net sales 
these factors helped offset sharply higher raw material costs experienced during the second half of the year  which negatively impacted gross margins by of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower selling  general and administrative expenses reflect the impact of several cost savings initiatives instituted in the second half of  including work force reductions million  and reduced merchandising and sampling expenses reflecting new product launch expenses incurred in million 
these initiatives  coupled with further cost reduction steps taken in the fall of  helped offset the inflationary cost impact of pension medical benefits and other incentive programs million 
congoleum recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of compared to million in to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the then minimum estimated cost that congoleum would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of congoleum s then proposed plan of reorganization 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the same period in the prior year  an improvement of million 
this improvement in operating income reflects higher sales and margins coupled with reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the interest accrued on the unpaid interest due on the senior notes 
due to the chapter proceedings  congoleum was precluded from making the interest payments due february  and august  on the senior notes 
congoleum recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which congoleum has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized 
liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  decreased by thousand to million 
net earnings  proceeds from the sale of a warehouse and proceeds from an insurance settlement provided cash that was used to fund seasonal working capital increases  capital expenditures  and payments on long term debt 
working capital at december  was million  up from million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was compared to at december   consistent with the increased amount of working capital at december  capital expenditures for were million compared to million for during the first quarter  the company sold a warehouse for million  resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
the warehouse was owned by tullahoma properties llc  a subsidiary in which the company owns a interest 
during the fourth quarter  the company received a net payment of million from an insurance company for the settlement of disputed claims for coverage of environmental related expenses 
the company has recorded provisions which it believes are adequate for environmental remediation  including provisions for testing and potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities  and non asbestos product related liabilities 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  that most of such amounts will be paid over a period of one to ten years and that the company expects to have sufficient resources to fund such amounts  the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation or regulation relating to these matters that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurances that any such costs could be passed along to its customers

the credit facility expires on september  the company expects that it will be able to extend the maturity or obtain a replacement facility on substantially similar terms before the expiration date of the current facility  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
the second principal debt agreement that american biltrite inc is a party to the note agreement is with the prudential insurance company of america prudential 
under the note agreement  the company previously issued notes in an aggregate principal amount of million the notes 
the notes generally bear interest at a rate of per annum  and the company is obligated to pay prudential an additional fee on each interest payment date if the company s and certain of its subsidiaries ratio of debt to ebitda  as defined under the note agreement  exceeds certain levels 
the amount of those fees that may be payable by the company varies depending on the extent the company s and certain of its subsidiaries debt exceeds ebitda  as determined under the note agreement  and is capped at of the outstanding principal amount of the series a notes 
during and for the first quarter of  the company was obligated to pay the full of that fee 
for the second quarter of  the fee was  and for the third and fourth quarter of it was 
principal on the notes is repayable in five annual installments of million beginning on august  the credit facility and the note agreement contain certain covenants that the company must satisfy 
the covenants included in the credit facility and the note agreement include certain financial tests  restrictions on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness or to grant liens on its assets and restrictions on the ability of the company to pay dividends on its capital stock 
in addition  the credit facility includes a financial covenant that requires the company s consolidated adjusted ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending june  to exceed of the company s consolidated pro forma fixed charges for the month period beginning immediately after june   as determined under the credit facility the pro forma financial covenant 
the financial tests are required to be calculated based on the company accounting for its majority owned subsidiary congoleum corporation on the equity method and include a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less certain cash payments for taxes  debt service  and dividends to interest expense  a minimum level of tangible net worth  a requirement that there be no consecutive quarterly losses from continuing operations  and a maximum level of capital spending 
in addition  beginning on september   the note agreement requires the company to satisfy a different set of financial covenants  including a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities  a minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges  a cap on the amount of debt as a percentage of tangible net worth  a cap on the amount of priority debt generally  debt of a company subsidiary not including congoleum that is not a guarantor under the note agreement plus secured debt of the company as a percentage of tangible net worth  a minimum leverage ratio  and a minimum amount of tangible net worth 
the company does not presently expect to meet all of the different set of financial covenants which take effect on september  and expects it will need to negotiate amendments to or waivers of certain covenants  although there can be no assurance it will be successful in that regard 
pursuant to the credit facility and the note agreement  the company and certain of its subsidiaries granted bofa  the canadian lenders and prudential a security interest in most of the company s and its subsidiaries assets 
the security interest granted does not include the shares of capital stock of the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum corporation or the assets of congoleum corporation 
in addition  pursuant to the credit facility and the note agreement  certain of the company s subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee the company s obligations excluding ab canada s obligations under the credit facility and the note agreement 
in the past  the company has had to amend its debt agreements in order to avoid being in default of those agreements as a result of failing to satisfy certain financial covenants contained in those agreements 
in january  the credit facility and the note agreement were amended to remove a former lender under the credit facility  reduce the credit line to million  and to modify the tangible net worth  adjusted ebitda to interest expense and consecutive quarterly loss covenants 
fees of thousand were paid to the lenders in connection with those amendments 
in april  the credit facility and the note agreement were amended to permit ab canada the ability to grant a security interest in certain assets under a credit agreement that ab canada was a party to 
in november  the credit facility was amended to extend the term of the credit facility to january   to modify the treatment of tax refunds in covenant calculations  and to modify the measurement levels for the adjusted ebitda to interest expense and current assets to current liabilities covenants for the remainder of the extended term of the credit facility 
a fee of thousand was paid in connection with that amendment 
on may   the company entered into amendments and restatements of its credit facility and note agreement 
the amendment to the credit facility extended the maturity date of the credit facility to september   added the pro forma financial covenant and added the million canadian sublimit facility for ab canada 
pursuant to the amended credit facility  ab canada granted a security interest in all of its personal property to the canadian lender 
during the second quarter of  ab canada repaid all amounts outstanding under its previous credit agreement with another lender from the proceeds of borrowings under the credit facility 
the amendment to the note agreement in may generally removed the application of the financial covenants under the note agreement for any measurement period prior to march   which effectively cured the company s preexisting failure to satisfy the adjusted ebitda to interest expense covenant as determined under the note agreement as of december  in addition  the amendments modified the financial covenants for under the note agreement to make them comparable to the financial covenants for under the credit facility 
the amendment also requires the company to enter into a definitive commitment to replace or refinance the million borrowing limit under the credit facility by june  and to consummate the replacement or refinancing by september  fees and expenses incurred for the amendments to the credit facility and note agreement in may were approximately thousand 
as indicated above  the company will need to extend or replace the credit facility and expects that it will need to obtain additional amendments or waivers of covenants under the note agreement during there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
certain defaults under the note agreement  such as defaults resulting from certain bankruptcy  insolvency and receivership matters of the company or certain of its subsidiaries not including congoleum  automatically cause all amounts owing with respect to the notes then outstanding under the note agreement to become immediately due and payable 
a default in the payment of principal or interest under the notes would allow each individual noteholder to cause all amounts owed with respect to the notes held by such holder to become immediately due and payable 
in addition  with respect to all other defaults under the note agreement  holders of at least of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding could cause all amounts then owing with respect to the notes to become immediately due and payable 
the company understands that prudential is the only holder of the notes and  as such  any decision to cause the acceleration of amounts owed with respect to the notes would be made at prudential s discretion 
certain events of default under the credit facility  such as defaults resulting from certain bankruptcy  insolvency and receivership matters of the company or certain of its subsidiaries not including congoleum automatically terminate bofa s and the canadian lender s obligations to make borrowings available under the credit facility and causes all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to become immediately due and payable 
with respect to all other events of default under the credit facility  bofa and the canadian lender may terminate their obligations to make borrowings available under the credit facility and cause all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to become immediately due and payable 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility and the note agreement  a default by the company under one of those agreements triggers a cross default under the other agreement 
if a default occurs  bofa and the canadian lender and prudential could respectively require the company to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective debt agreements 
if a default occurs and the company is unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lender and the company is required to repay all amounts outstanding under those agreements  the company would need to obtain funding from another source 
otherwise  the company would likely be unable to repay those outstanding amounts  in which case  bofa as administrative agent over the collateral securing the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the note agreement  might exercise bofa s and the canadian lender s and prudential s rights over that collateral 
any default by the company under the credit facility or the note agreement that results in the company being required to immediately repay outstanding amounts under its debt agreements  and for which suitable replacement financing is not timely obtained  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as noted above  the credit facility and the note agreement restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
moreover  since the company and most of its subsidiaries have already granted security interests in most of their assets  the company s ability to obtain any additional debt financing may be limited 
the company currently believes that its cash flow from operations  expected proceeds from the sale of the janus flooring assets and borrowings available under its existing credit facilities will be adequate for its expected capital expenditure  working capital and debt service needs  subject to compliance with the covenants contained in its debt agreements and the ability of the company to replace or refinance its existing credit facility that is scheduled to expire on september  on satisfactory terms 
however  if circumstances change  the inability of the company to obtain any necessary additional debt financing would likely have a material adverse effect on its business  operations and financial condition 
under the terms of the eighth plan  abi expects to contribute thousand in cash to the plan trust on the effective date of the plan 
under the terms of the eighth plan  unlike under the sixth plan  abi would not pledge any of its assets  including shares of congoleum stock it owns or certain rights it has to receive indemnification payments from congoleum pursuant to a joint venture agreement that abi and congoleum are party to  as security for congoleum s obligations under the new convertible security as was contemplated  under the sixth plan with respect to congoleum s obligations under the promissory note described in the sixth plan 
in addition  the eighth plan does not  unlike the sixth plan  contemplate that abi would be required to make any additional contributions to the plan trust if abi were to sell its congoleum stock under the circumstances provided under the sixth plan  a description of which abi provided in previous periodic reports it filed with the sec 
under the eighth plan  abi would receive certain relief as may be afforded under section g of the bankruptcy code from asbestos personal injury claims that derive from claims made against congoleum  which claims are expected to be channeled to the plan trust 
however  the eighth plan does not provide that any other asbestos claims that may be asserted against abi would be channeled to the plan trust 
to the extent that the company pays material amounts for asbestos related property damage claims that the company would have been entitled to be reimbursed for by congoleum absent the provisions of congoleum s plan of reorganization  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
furthermore  to the extent that the amount of any of the company s indemnity claims against the plan trust are reduced pursuant to the distribution procedures under congoleum s plan of reorganization to an amount less than the corresponding amount paid by the company  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the third quarter of future dividends  if any  will be determined by the company s board of directors based upon the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  among other considerations 
under the credit facility  aggregate dividend payments since june  are generally limited to of cumulative consolidated net income computed treating congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the credit facility  earned from june  under the note agreement  aggregate dividend payments since december  generally may not exceed the sum of million plus of cumulative consolidated net income accounting for congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the note agreement  earned after december  the following table summarizes the company s obligations at december  for future principal payments and related interest on its long term debt assuming any necessary amendments or waivers are obtained from its lenders  future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases and future minimum royalty and advertising payments for licensed brand names on k m products 
payments due by period in thousands and total thereafter long term debt       interest     operating leases     pension plan funding  royalty advertising commitments   the projected pension plans funding was actuarially determined using the following assumptions i current funding laws remain unchanged  ii there are no gains or losses for and later  iii the discount rates used for the projection are the same as the rates used for the pension valuations as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k  and iv for years after  projected contributions are assumed to increase with inflation 
liquidity and capital resources congoleum the consolidated financial statements of congoleum have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should congoleum be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of congoleum s bankruptcy proceedings 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the eighth plan and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when congoleum or the plan trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
there can be no assurances that these reimbursements will be received  or that the terms providing for such reimbursements will not be modified 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan of reorganization  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million at a minimum in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
required expenditures could be materially higher than these estimates 
congoleum currently holds million in restricted cash that may be available to offset future costs incurred pursuing insurance coverage  subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
due to the chapter proceedings  congoleum has been precluded from making interest payments on its outstanding senior notes since january  the amount of accrued interest that is due but has not been paid on the senior notes at december  was approximately million  including interest on the unpaid interest due 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered a law firm formerly representing congoleum to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
the law firm is expected to appeal from this ruling once an order embodying the ruling has been entered by the bankruptcy court 
it is expected that the amount of the disgorgement will range from approximately million to million 
pursuant to the terms of the eighth plan  holders of the senior notes would forego million in interest accrued during the post petition period and would receive the right to any funds net of related expenses from the fee disgorgement and other causes of action against the law firm and one of its service providers  subject to a maximum of million plus interest at from the effective date of the plan until the time such payment is made the maximum additional bondholder recovery 
there can be no assurance that the plan  which is ultimately confirmed  will provide for such interest forgiveness 
any net recoveries in excess of the maximum additional bondholder recovery would be paid to the plan trust 
pursuant to the terms of the eighth plan congoleum is to make a cash contribution of approximately million to the plan trust when the plan goes effective 
the eighth plan also provides that the maturity of the senior notes will be extended by three years from august to august there can be no assurance that the plan which is ultimately confirmed  if any  will provide for such interest forgiveness or maturity extension 
as part of the eighth plan  congoleum expects that it will issue a convertible security the new convertible security to the plan trust 
under the terms of the eighth plan  the new convertible security means either shares of preferred stock or convertible promissory notes to be issued by reorganized congoleum and contributed to the plan trust on the effective date in satisfaction of section g of the bankruptcy code 
if the new convertible security is to be shares of preferred stock of reorganized congoleum  it shall have the following terms i an initial liquidation preference equal to  in the aggregate  such amount being subject to increase in the amount  if any  by which of reorganized congoleum s market capitalization based on average trading prices for reorganized congoleum s class a common stock at the close of trading for the consecutive trading days beginning on the one year anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization  exceeds such initial liquidation preference  ii an initial dividend rate equal to of the liquidation preference per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  with such dividend rate to reset at the rate of of the liquidation preference per annum on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization and payable at such reset dividend rate per annum unless and until redeemed  iii redeemable for the liquidation preference at the option of the plan trust or reorganized congoleum following the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization  iv a mandatory redemption on the fifteenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization if not redeemed earlier  v convertible into  shares of congoleum class a common stock or the equivalent thereof on a fully diluted basis upon a specified default of the obligation to pay dividends and a failure to cure such default within any cure period  which  when combined with the million newly issued shares of congoleum class a common stock to be contributed to the plan trust  will result in the plan trust owning of the voting common shares of reorganized congoleum on a fully diluted basis  and vi no voting rights 
if the new convertible security is convertible promissory notes  such notes will be on economic terms substantially equivalent to provisions i and v of the preferred stock described herein  with other terms substantially the same as the promissory note described in the sixth plan 
although the earliest redemption or repayment date for the new convertible security does not occur until its tenth anniversary of issuance  this obligation may affect congoleum s ability to obtain other sources of financing or refinance existing obligations 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the new convertible security will require congoleum to make regularly scheduled dividend or interest payments prior to such instrument s redemption or maturity date 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  million remaining from a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to the lien of the collateral trust  is included as restricted cash at december  congoleum expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust 
working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  compared to to at december  the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was to compared to to at december  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million in net cash from operations decreased from to due to a decline in operating results  lower accrued expenses and the non recurrence of the one time benefit realized in from the resumption of normal trade credit which had contracted at the end of capital expenditures in totaled million 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on december  with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation and effectiveness of its plan of reorganization 
while congoleum expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that congoleum will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility as extended will be renewed prior to its expiration if congoleum s plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum generated million in cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  which includes the benefit of million of accrued but unpaid interest on long term debt 
congoleum believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
to meet the funding obligations under the eighth plan  congoleum anticipates it will need to obtain the contemplated forgiveness of interest on the senior notes and obtain reimbursement for any unreimbursed coverage litigation costs 
actual sources and uses of funds to consummate the effectiveness of the eighth plan or any other plan may differ from this description  but confirmation of any plan is dependent on such plan demonstrating it leaves congoleum with sufficient liquidity that further reorganization will not be needed 
congoleum s inability to obtain confirmation of the eighth plan in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes congoleum s contractual obligations  adjusted for terms of the eighth plan  for future principal and interest payments on its debt  future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases  future minimum pension plans and other post employment benefits opeb funding and obligations to the plan trust pursuant to the eighth plan at december  congoleum does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts

the projected pension plans funding was actuarially determined using the following assumptions i current funding laws remain unchanged  ii there are no gains or losses for and later  iii the discount rates used for the projection are the same as the rates used for the pension valuations as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k  and iv for years after  projected contributions are assumed to increase with inflation 
congoleum s other post employment benefit plan is an unfunded plan 
funding requirements each year are assumed to approximate the expenses for each year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
payments of cash  principal and dividend or interest to the plan trust assume congoleum s eighth plan is effective december  and do not include any additional principal or dividends or interest thereon resulting from any adjustments to the new convertible security upon the one year anniversary of the plan effective date 
contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites

abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
during  the company decided to cease operations at its janus flooring division and recorded a charge of million in the second quarter consisting primarily of million to reduce inventories to net realizable value  million in accounts receivable allowances  a million asset impairment charge related to machinery and equipment and a million income tax provision to write off deferred tax assets deemed not probable of recovery 
the company disposed of substantially all of the assets of janus flooring  other than the real estate  during future expenditures related to this discontinued operation are not expected to be material  and the company expects to realize approximately million in net future cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate 
any net sales proceeds are expected to be applied to repaying amounts outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
during  the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the land and building for an amount in excess of the carrying value of the property 
the company expects the sale will close in the second quarter of if the company is unable to timely sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of janus on terms acceptable to abi and in accordance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements  including canadian regulations and laws  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a five year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
for example  it is estimated that a decrease in the company s dismissal rate would result in a increase in liability assuming all other variables remained constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the same factors that affect developing forecasts of potential indemnity costs for asbestos related liabilities also affect estimates of the total amount of insurance that is probable of recovery  as do a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of some of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how legal and other loss handling costs will be covered by the insurance policies  and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
the company analyzes these estimates on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when congoleum or the plan trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
there can be no assurances that these reimbursements will be received or that the terms providing for such reimbursements will not be modified 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan or reorganization  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million at a minimum in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
congoleum currently holds million in restricted cash that may be available to offset future costs incurred pursuing insurance coverage  subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
required expenditures could be materially higher than these estimates 
congoleum expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
in light of its bankruptcy filing and proposed plan of reorganization  congoleum believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
congoleum estimates the minimum remaining amount of the contributions and costs to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
these amounts do not include the liability associated with a million insurance settlement recorded as restricted cash  which congoleum expects to contribute  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust 
at december  this liability comprised of the original settlement plus interest to date  less million in reimbursements approved by the bankruptcy court amounted to million and is included in current asbestos related liabilities 
congoleum is not yet able to determine the additional costs that may be required to effect a new amended plan  and actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing any plan of reorganization could be materially higher 
congoleum will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
consolidation of congoleum the company s subsidiary congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results for congoleum for all periods presented 
abi continues to own a majority of the voting stock of congoleum 
the company expects to continue to control congoleum while it is in bankruptcy 
additionally  under the terms of the eighth plan  which remains subject to creditor acceptance  bankruptcy court approval  and numerous other contingencies  abi would continue to have control through a majority of share votes 
accordingly  the company has elected to continue to consolidate the financial statements of congoleum in its consolidated results because it believes that is the appropriate presentation given its anticipated continuing control of congoleum 
however  the accompanying financial statements also present the details of consolidation to separately show the financial condition  operating results and cash flows of abi including its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum  which may be more meaningful for certain analyses 
abi s reported consolidated financial condition  operating results and cash flows consolidated results would be materially different if they did not include congoleum 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple potentially responsible parties  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters in an effort to minimize costs 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
in addition  substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  belgium and singapore and sells those products in those markets as well as countries of europe and asia 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and canadian dollar and the us dollar and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar or euro  the us dollar value of foreign currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of the foreign currency amount of sales increases 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
