in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties

overview our business and business segments we are a leading global provider of investment processing  fund processing  and investment management business outsourcing solutions that help corporations  financial institutions  financial advisors  and affluent families create and manage wealth 
our outsourcing business solutions consist mainly of investment processing  fund processing  and investment management 
investment processing fees are earned as monthly fees for contracted services including computer processing services  software licenses  and trust operations services  as well as transaction based fees for providing securities valuation and trade execution 
fund processing and investment management fees are earned as a percentage of average assets under management or administration 
as of december   through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest  we administer billion in mutual fund and pooled assets and manage billion in assets 
our partnership interest  lsv  represents billion of our total assets under management 
we conduct business through five business segments offering our business solutions to specific target markets 
in  these business segments were private banking and trust provides investment processing  fund processing  and investment management programs to banks and other trust institutions located in the united states and canada and accounts for percent of consolidated revenues in  investment advisors provides investment management programs to affluent investors through a network of independent registered investment advisors  financial planners  and other investment professionals in the united states and accounts for percent of consolidated revenues in  enterprises provides investment management programs that offer retirement solutions to corporations  unions  municipalities  and hospitals  and an endowment solution for the not for profit market in the united states and accounts for percent of consolidated revenues in  money managers provides fund investment processing and institutional and separate account operational outsourcing solutions to traditional investment managers located in the united states and to investment managers worldwide of alternative asset classes such as hedge funds  fund of funds  and private equity funds and accounts for percent of consolidated revenues in  and investments in new businesses provides investment management programs and fund processing to investment advisors  corporations  and money managers located outside the united states and investment processing solutions to institutions in the united kingdom and continental europe 
this segment also includes our investment programs offered to affluent families residing in the united states 
this segment accounts for percent of consolidated revenues in page of 
table of contents recent highlights our revenues for were million  with net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
we believe the following items were significant to our business during revenue growth was primarily driven by higher asset based fees in our investment advisors  enterprises and investments in new businesses segments due to capital market appreciation in and stronger capital markets increased the value of assets we manage for our existing clients  improving our base revenues 
new sales in our enterprises  money managers and investments in new businesses segments also contributed to our revenue growth 
we believe these sales of new business were due to the validation of new and existing strategies and solutions in our target markets 
revenues from fund processing fees in the private banking and trust segment decreased million from the loss of fund processing bank clients 
certain of these client losses  however  caused a reduction in direct fund processing expenses and reduced the negative impact to our margins 
investment processing revenues in our private banking and trust segment increased million due primarily to new sales and non recurring project fees for our bsp solutions and the addition of a large bank client of our asp solutions 
this increase  however  was partially offset by the loss of a significant large bank client of our asp solutions 
in the investment advisors and enterprises segments  revenues during the first half of were affected by the recognition on a gross basis of million of third party advisory fees related to our separate account program and pass through fees associated with our k recordkeeping offering beginning in mid in the prior year comparable period  these revenues were reported net of the costs  having the effect of increasing revenues and expenses by the same amount 
our growth in net income was primarily a result of our investment in lsv 
lsv recorded significant growth in revenues and earnings  mainly attributed to new sales and capital market appreciation 
we currently own a percent interest in lsv 
our earnings from lsv grew million  or percent  in as compared to the prior year period 
we continued to make significant expenditures for the development of our global wealth platform as we progressed through the development phase of this project 
the majority of these costs are eligible for capitalization  however  a portion is ineligible and is expensed as incurred 
we capitalized million in as compared to million in in software development costs for this platform 
we expect to incur significant development costs throughout it was determined that software purchased from vermeg services sarl vermeg  a third party software vendor  intended for use in our global wealth platform did not satisfy all of the expected functionality requirements 
prior capitalized development costs and associated unpaid liabilities were written off  resulting in a net charge against earnings of million during additionally  we recognized million in expense related to a litigation settlement with vermeg 
the payment was for services previously rendered to us and for a perpetual pre paid license to use certain vermeg technology to be used in the global wealth platform 
the total charge against earnings was million 
this charge was allocated across all of our business segments  with the more significant portions going to private banking and trust  investment advisors  and investments in new businesses 
consolidated operating margins declined due primarily to increased investments in the operational infrastructure necessary to deliver new company strategies and solutions 
a substantial portion of these costs relate to personnel and third party service providers 
we continued our stock repurchase program and purchased approximately million shares at an average price of approximately per share 
this caused our diluted earnings per share to grow at a faster rate than our earnings

table of contents forward looking information and risk factors certain information contained in this discussion is or may be considered forward looking 
forward looking statements relate to future operations  strategies  financial results or other developments 
forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that involve certain risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change 
although we believe our assumptions are reasonable  they could be inaccurate 
our actual future revenues and income could differ materially from our expected results 
we have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
among the risks and uncertainties which may affect our future operations  strategies  financial results or other developments are those risks described in item a risk factors of this annual report 
the following items are  in our opinion  anticipated to occur in the next to months 
we are currently in the development stage of building the global wealth platform and expect the amount of spending and capitalization to continue throughout most of at a level generally consistent with we plan to implement the new platform later in or early to support global private banks that currently use our investment processing services 
we expect to begin amortizing the new platform at the same time when the implementation occurs 
we have been and will continue to be in an investment phase  which involves transforming our company from one that is product and services based to one that is solutions based 
each of our business segments has developed a new business model that is being deployed that will gradually move our clients to our new business solutions 
we will continue to make substantial investments in operational infrastructure and technology to support the new business model of each segment 
employee stock options are a significant component of our overall compensation structure 
the provisions contained in statement of financial accounting standards r are effective in the first quarter and require us to recognize expense associated with employee stock options 
we expect expense from stock options to be approximately million for the year 
in january  we entered into an agreement to provide an unsecured loan guaranty to lsv employee group to assist in their purchase of partnership units from two existing partners of lsv 
due to this transaction and other elements of our relationship  we may be required to include lsv and lsv employee group in our financial statements as fully consolidated entities and report our interest in lsv as a new segment in this will not affect net income but will affect our gross revenues and cost of operations 
we began delivery of our sei advisor desktop technology to our investment advisor clients in january this technology is an early version of the front end of the global wealth platform 
we expect amortization expense to increase by approximately million in as a result of the implementation of this component 
our strategic goal is to build and deliver world class business solutions globally 
as areas of our non us business mature and our solutions prove themselves  we will consolidate this activity under a single globally managed segment 
in keeping with this strategy  starting in  we will consolidate all revenue and costs associated with our enterprises segment and the global institutional business of our investments in new businesses segment under a single segment 
within the investment advisors segment  our advisor clients could enter into fundamentally different business relationships with us 
some advisors could partner with us for many activities while other advisor clients enter into a more traditional relationship with separate fee structures 
accordingly  these two groups of advisor clients seek different services from us 
in order to achieve focus on each of these efforts and in recognition of the differing client needs  we are separating these business lines 
in  those advisors who partner with us for our life and wealth services will be consolidated with other wealth initiatives included in the investments in new businesses segment 
we have made the decision to consolidate all registered mutual fund administration business in the money manager segment 
consequently  to enable us to deliver a consistent solution to all clients leveraging our domain expertise more effectively  we will move the revenue and costs associated with this business activity from the private banking and trust segment to the money managers segment beginning in page of

consolidated our revenues increased million  or percent  to million in compared to  and increased million  or nine percent  to million in compared to the increase in revenues in both comparable periods was primarily driven by increased asset based investment management fees from existing clients in our investment advisors  enterprises and investments in new businesses segments due to capital market appreciation in and new sales in our enterprises and investments in new businesses segments also contributed to growth in our asset based investment management fees 
fund processing fees in our money managers segment increased in both comparable periods  mainly due to new client sales  but were substantially offset by reduced fund processing fees from banks clients because of the loss of large bank clients in and brokerage fees declined in due to the recognition of significant non recurring brokerage fees from manager transitions in and the diminishing demand for soft dollar services by our bank clients 
our income from operations increased million in  or one percent  and increased million  or two percent  in compared to operating margin declined to percent in after declining to percent in from percent in the increase in operating income in both comparable periods was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues

table of contents qualify for hedge accounting under current accounting rules 
as a result  changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments were recorded in current period earnings whereas the change in the fair value of the hedged asset will be realized upon sale in future period earnings 
our decision to enter into derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting may cause volatility in quarterly earnings 
we perform a review of all investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regard to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the price of investments based on available market prices 
additional consideration is given to the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment 
we currently have a single investment in a company sponsored mutual fund held for purposes of satisfying certain regulatory requirements for our thrift operations 
this mutual fund invests primarily in federal agency mortgage backed securities 
this investment has an unrealized loss of approximately million but has a positive average annual return and pays dividends on a monthly basis 
other gains losses in include the write down of approximately million of an equity investment carried at cost in a private technology firm 
interest income is earned based upon the amount of cash invested daily 
fluctuations in interest income recognized for one period in relation to another are due to changes in the average cash balance invested for the period and or changes in interest rates 
the increase in interest income in and was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and investments of cash equivalents into higher yielding investment vehicles 
interest expense is directly attributable to our long term debt and other borrowings 
interest expense in and decreased due to the lower principal balances of debt outstanding

at december   our unused sources of liquidity consisted of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and the credit facility of million 
net cash provided by operating activities grew million in and million in from the prior comparable years primarily from an increase in income 
the increase in both periods also included additional deferred taxes  mainly due to the higher amount of software development costs eligible for capitalization and currently deductible for tax purposes 
net cash from operating activities in and was negatively affected by a decline in the tax benefit received from stock option exercises 
the net change in our working capital accounts negatively affected net cash from operating activities in   and net cash used in investing activities includes the capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software  purchases and sales of marketable securities  and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in and decreased million in as compared to the prior year period

table of contents during the past several years  we have invested in the development of our new global wealth platform 
many of these expenditures were not eligible for capitalization until in  a larger portion of our expenditures were for development rather than research and design and were eligible for capitalization under accounting rules 
we continued to make substantial investments in to further develop the global wealth platform 
the increase in capitalized cost in compared to was primarily due to a higher level of spending

we and certain other investors are partners of lsv 
certain partners of lsv  excluding sei  sold in the aggregate an eight percent interest the transferred interests in lsv to the borrower  which is owned by certain current employees of lsv 
in order to finance a portion of the purchase price for such interests  the borrower obtained financing from the agent and certain other lenders in the form of a term loan pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement dated january  lsv is party to the credit agreement to confirm certain representations  warranties and agreements 
the principal amount of the term loan is million 
principal and interest payments are made by the borrower in quarterly installments 
the principal balance on the term loan must be paid in full by the borrower by january  page of 
table of contents according to the terms and conditions of the guaranty agreement  we agreed to provide an unsecured guaranty to the lenders of all obligations of the borrower under the credit agreement 
our obligations under the guaranty agreement are triggered in the event of default which includes non payment of the loan by the borrower  non payment by the borrower or lsv of other borrower debt or lsv debt  certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the borrower of lsv  and a change of control 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  in addition to the rights of the lenders to seek repayment from the borrower and exercise all rights as secured creditors against the borrower  the lenders have the right to seek payment from us of the borrower s obligations under the credit agreement 
as recourse for such payment  we will be subrogated to the rights of the lenders under the credit agreement and the guaranty agreement  including the security interest in the pledged transferred interests

critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe that the following accounting policies require extensive judgment by our management to determine the recognition and timing of amounts recorded in our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the periods in which the related services are performed provided that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
cash received by us in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
our principal sources of revenues are information processing and software servicing fees that are recurring in nature and earned based on the number of trust accounts being serviced  transaction based fees for providing securities valuation and trade execution services and non recurring project fees that are determined upon contractual agreements  and asset management  administration and distribution fees calculated as a percentage of the total average daily net assets under management or administration 
the majority of our revenues are based on contractual arrangements 
certain portions of our revenues require management s page of 
table of contents consideration of the nature of the client relationship in determining whether to recognize as revenue the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to vendors for certain services related to the product or service offering 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our clients to make their scheduled payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the total amount of outstanding receivables and an aging analysis at each balance sheet date 
other factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as historical trends  the financial condition of our clients and other factors that may be deemed appropriate 
based upon this analysis  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted to an amount that is sufficient to cover expected losses from doubtful accounts 
investments available for sale we value our investments in marketable securities based on quoted market prices 
we review our investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regard to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the fair value of our investments  our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period sufficient to allow the value to recover  and the financial condition of the investment 
after considering these factors  if we believe that a decline is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value through current period earnings 
computer software development costs we utilize internally developed computer software as part of our product offering 
in the development of a new software product  substantial consideration must be given by management to determine whether costs incurred are research and development costs  or internal software development costs eligible for capitalization 
management must consider a number of different factors during their evaluation of each computer software development project that includes estimates and assumptions 
costs considered to be research and development are expensed as incurred 
after meeting certain requirements  internal software development costs are capitalized as incurred 
income tax accounting the computation of our income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions around the world 
actual income tax expense can differ significantly from our estimates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on our estimated future taxable income and tax strategies 
we also recognize a liability for expected contingencies 
we assess the liability based on our review of various tax issues and interpretations of tax law 
differences between our estimates and actual results could have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the assessment of critical accounting policies is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that can occur from the application of the full range of our accounting policies 
materially different financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well 
also  materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards 
page of 
table of contents new accounting pronouncements effective january   we will adopt the provisions in statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires the cost of employee stock options be recognized in a company s financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
we will apply the modified prospective application transition method which permits a company to apply the standards prospectively only and does not require the restatement of prior period financial statements 
based on the amount of outstanding employee stock options at december   we have approximately million in total unrecognized compensation expense 
we expect to recognize the compensation expense according to the following schedule period compensation expense total in december  we accelerated million options that were out of the money to eliminate million in compensation expense we would otherwise recognize with respect to these options

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio 
our excess cash is principally invested in short term  highly liquid financial instruments  mainly money market funds  with a substantial portion of such investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
our investment portfolio includes us treasury securities maturing within one year and a long term fixed income mutual fund principally invested in federal government agency securities 
we place our investments in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
while changes in interest rates could decrease interest income  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the local currencies of various foreign countries  principally canada  ireland  the united kingdom and south korea 
the total of all of our foreign operations accounts for approximately percent of total consolidated revenues 
also  most of our foreign operations match local currency revenues with local currency costs 
due to these reasons  we do not hedge against foreign operations 
price risk we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of investments in marketable securities relating to the startup of new pooled investment offerings 
the length of time that our funds remain invested in these new pooled investment offerings is dependent on client subscriptions 
we will redeem our investments as clients subscribe to these new investment offerings 
to provide protection against potential fair value changes for these investments  we have entered into various derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we held derivative financial instruments with a notional amount of million and an expected maturity in changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in current period earnings  whereas  the change in the fair value of the investment is recorded on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income 
therefore  changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and changes in the fair value of the investment are not recognized through earnings in the same period 
we did not enter into or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during or the current period earnings include losses of million and million in and  respectively  relating to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical ten percent change in the fair value of our investments would be investment hypothetical change in value mutual funds equities in consideration of the hypothetical change in value  our derivative financial instruments related to equities would substantially offset the change in fair value of the equity securities
