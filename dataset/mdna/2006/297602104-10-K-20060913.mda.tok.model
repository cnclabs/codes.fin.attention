item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to our future results 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the effects of terrorist attacks or conflicts or wars involving the united states or its allies or trading partners  the effects of labor strikes  weather conditions that may affect sales  volatility in fuel  utility  transportation and security costs  changes in global or regional political or economic conditions  including changes in governmental and central bank policies  changes in business conditions in the furniture industry  including changes in consumer spending patterns and demand for home furnishings  effects of our brand awareness and marketing programs  including changes in demand for our existing and new products  our ability to locate new idc sites and or negotiate favorable lease terms for additional idcs or for the expansion of existing idcs  competitive factors  including changes in products or marketing efforts of others  pricing pressures  fluctuations in interest rates and the cost  availability and quality of raw materials  those matters discussed in item a of this annual report and in our sec filings  and our future decisions 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we estimate an inventory valuation allowance for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write downs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
as such  revenue recognition occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen owned retail idcs  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
we permit our customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms we offer are standard for the industry 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail idc acquisitions we account for the acquisition of retail idcs and related assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires application of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
we conduct our required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside our control 
business insurance reserves we have insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
we accrue estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although we believe that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we adjust insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with our counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
basis of presentation as of june   ethan allen interiors inc has no material assets other than its ownership of the capital stock of ethan allen global  inc and conducts all significant transactions through ethan allen global  inc  therefore  substantially all of the financial information presented herein is that of ethan allen global  inc results of operations our revenues are comprised of i wholesale sales to independently owned and company owned retail idcs and ii retail sales of company owned idcs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included under item of this annual report 
the components of consolidated revenues and operating income are as follows in millions fiscal year ended june  revenue wholesale segment 


retail segment 


elimination of inter segment sales 


consolidated revenue  


operating income wholesale segment 


retail segment 


adjustment for inter company profit 


consolidated operating income 


operating income for the wholesale segment includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges  net of million and million recorded in fiscal years and  respectively 
represents the change in the inventory profit elimination entry necessary to adjust for the embedded wholesale profit contained in ethan allen owned idc inventory existing at the end of the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  from fiscal consolidated revenue of million 
net sales for the period largely reflect the delivery of product associated with booked orders and backlog existing as of the beginning of the period 
during the year  sales benefited  primarily  from an increase in the incoming order rate as a result of i continued efforts to reposition the retail network  and ii new product introductions 
in addition  sales were positively impacted  to some degree  by the continued implementation of our mission possible initiative  the objective of which is to reduce the lead time associated with product delivery to both our independent retailers and consumers 
to date  the repositioning of the retail network has involved three primary elements the opening of new or relocated idcs in larger and more prominent locations  development of a more focused advertising campaign to highlight our solutions based approach and position ethan allen as an authority in style and design  and  during the last year  investment within the retail network to strengthen the existing management structure 
implementation of our project management initiative  which resulted in the promotion and or hiring of approximately project managers  has enabled us to increase the level of service  professionalism  interior design competence  efficiency  and effectiveness of retail idc personnel 
with project managers actively partnering with design consultants and their customers  we believe we have improved the customer service experience and facilitated  to some degree  better awareness of potential cross selling opportunities 
wholesale revenue for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year increase was attributable to an increase in the incoming order rate  coupled with increased throughput within our manufacturing operations  and improved service position within certain imported product lines  both of which resulted in shorter delivery cycle times and higher backlog turnover 
retail revenue from ethan allen owned idcs for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in retail sales by ethan allen owned idcs was attributable to increases in comparable idc delivered sales of million  or  and sales generated by newly opened including relocated or acquired idcs of million 
these favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease resulting from sold and closed idcs  which generated million fewer sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of ethan allen owned idcs increased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  we acquired idcs from independent retailers  closed idc  and opened idcs of which were relocations 
comparable idcs are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations for newly opened or relocated locations 
idcs acquired from independent retailers are included in comparable idc sales in their th full month of ethan allen owned operations 
year over year  written business of ethan allen owned idcs increased and comparable idc written business increased 
over that same period  wholesale orders increased 
the increase in both retail and wholesale written sales during the period was likely the result of i continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii recent product introductions  and  to some degree  iii our use of national television as an advertising medium throughout the year 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to i an increase in total sales volume including a higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in the current period compared to in the prior year period  and ii improved margins resulting from the continued off shore sourcing of selected product lines and more efficient plant performance within our domestic manufacturing operations 
these favorable variances were partially offset by increased costs associated with selected raw materials  namely foam  and utilities 
consolidated gross margin increased to during the twelve months ended june  from in the prior year comparable period as a result  primarily  of the factors identified previously 
operating profit  the elements of which are discussed in greater detail below  was impacted by the following items during fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we announced a plan to convert one of our existing manufacturing facilities into a regional distribution center 
the facility  involved in the production of wood case goods furniture  is located in dublin  virginia 
in connection with this initiative  we permanently ceased production at the dublin location and are currently in the process of consolidating the distribution operations of our existing old fort  north carolina location into this new  larger facility 
the decision impacted approximately employees  of which approximately have been or will be employed in new positions 
a pre tax restructuring and impairment charge of million was recorded for costs associated with this plant conversion  of which million was related to employee severance and benefits and other plant exit costs  and million was related to fixed asset impairment charges  primarily for machinery and equipment  stemming from the decision to cease production activities 
in addition  adjustments totaling million were recorded during fiscal to reverse certain accruals previously established in connection with an earlier plant consolidation plan which were no longer required 
in addition  on july   we adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
sfas no 
r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in our financial statements 
in adopting sfas no 
r  we applied the modified prospective approach to transition which requires that the provisions of sfas no 
r be applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  operating expenses for the twelve month period ended june  include share based compensation expense totaling million 
for the prior year comparable period  during which time we applied the apb no 
intrinsic value method of measuring compensation cost  the cost associated with share based compensation arrangements totaled million 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
including the restructuring and impairment and share based compensation charges referred to above  operating expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in the current year from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our continued efforts to reposition the retail network which has resulted in higher costs associated with managerial salaries and benefits  commissions  occupancy  and delivery and warehousing 
in addition  current year operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by i increased distribution costs attributable to higher fuel and freight charges  some of which stems from the improved sales volume noted during the period  ii an increase in advertising costs  largely as a result of our decision to utilize national television as an advertising medium throughout the year  iii the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge  and iv an increase in compensation and benefit related expenses 
including the restructuring and impairment and share based compensation charges referred to above  consolidated operating income for the year ended june  totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
this represents an increase of million  or  and was attributable to the overall increase in gross profit referred to previously  partially offset by higher operating expenses noted during the period 
including the restructuring and impairment and share based compensation charges referred to above  wholesale operating income for the year ended june  was million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the wholesale operating margin in fiscal and fiscal amounted to and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in wholesale operating income was primarily attributable to i the increase in wholesale sales volume  and ii the continued off shore sourcing of selected product lines and improved margins attributable to more efficient plant performance within our domestic manufacturing operations  partially offset by higher costs associated with selected raw materials  namely foam  and utilities 
these increases were further offset by i increased distribution costs attributable to higher fuel and freight charges  ii an increase in advertising costs as a result of our decision to utilize national television as an advertising medium throughout the year  iii the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge  iv an increase in compensation and benefit related expenses  and v losses incurred in connection with the disposition of certain plant machinery and equipment 
retail operating income increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million in the prior year 
the retail operating margin in fiscal and fiscal amounted to and  respectively 
the increase in retail operating income generated by ethan allen owned idcs is primarily attributable to higher sales volume generated by comparable  and newly opened including relocations or acquired idcs  partially offset by higher operating expenses as a result of our continued efforts to reposition the retail network and a decline in operating income associated with idcs sold or closed during the year 
interest and other miscellaneous income net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million increase was due  primarily  to increased investment income resulting from higher cash and short term investment balances maintained during the current year  partially offset by higher prior year gains recorded in connection with the sale of real estate 
interest and other related financing costs for fiscal increased million to million from million in the prior year 
the increase was due  primarily  to interest expense incurred in connection with our issuance of senior unsecured debt in september income tax expense totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate for the current year was  down from in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate was a result  primarily  of the benefits derived from the manufacturers deduction provided for under the jobs creation act of and certain state tax planning initiatives 
partially offsetting these items were the adverse effects of recently enacted changes within certain state tax legislation  and increased state income tax liability arising in connection with the operation of a greater number of company owned idcs 
for fiscal  we recorded net income of million as compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in the current year and in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for fiscal totaled million  representing a decrease of million  or  from fiscal consolidated revenue of million 
net sales for the period reflect the delivery of product associated with a slight decline in total booked orders  and the resultant lower level of backlog noted throughout most of the year 
the modest decrease in net sales for the year was due  primarily  to i inconsistent consumer spending habits noted throughout much of the last twelve months likely attributable to ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the threat of further interest rate increases  rising fuel prices and a decline in the stock markets  and ii our transition to everyday pricing from periodic sale events conducted in the prior year 
these factors were partially offset by the continued re positioning of our retail idcs to larger and more prominent locations and the impact of recent product introductions 
overall  sales volume for the period was impacted by increased industry competition and the continued use of highly promotional pricing strategies by our competitors 
wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year decrease was attributable to a decline in the incoming order rate noted during the period  particularly within our case goods operations  partially offset by increased throughput within our upholstery operations  and improved service position  resulting in shorter delivery cycle times  within certain imported product lines 
retail revenue from ethan allen owned idcs for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase in retail delivered sales by ethan allen owned idcs was attributable to an increase in sales generated by newly opened including relocations or acquired idcs of million  partially offset by decreases in comparable idc delivered sales of million  or  and closed idcs  which generated million fewer sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of ethan allen owned idcs decreased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  we acquired idcs from  and sold idcs to  independent retailers  closed idcs and opened idcs of which were relocations 
total booked orders  which include wholesale orders and written business of ethan allen owned retail idcs  decreased from the prior year 
year over year  wholesale orders decreased while ethan allen owned idc orders increased and comparable idc written business increased 
the modest increase in retail written sales was likely attributable to the continued re positioning of our retail idcs to larger and more prominent locations 
during the year  we increased distribution of the furnishing solutions by ethan allen direct mail magazine  distributing approximately million copies which represented a increase over historical annual levels 
these positive factors were likely offset  to some degree  by the current year transition to everyday pricing from periodic sale events conducted in the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal totaled million and was effectively unchanged from prior year 
consolidated gross profit was favorably impacted by a higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  an overall increase in retail sales volume as a result of the continued re positioning of our idc network  and a reduction in costs associated with excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities 
these favorable variances were offset by gross profit declines resulting  primarily  from i an overall decrease in wholesale shipments  ii ordinary inefficiencies within our case goods operations associated with the production of first cuts for new collections  and iii price increases within selected raw material categories  namely lumber  foam  plywood and steel 
consolidated gross margin increased to for the year ended june  from in the prior year as a result  primarily  of the factors identified previously 
operating expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in the prior year  which included restructuring and impairment charges  net of million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to i the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year  ii cost savings attributable to the closure of selected plant locations  and iii a decrease in advertising costs within the wholesale segment stemming from our decision to increase distribution of our direct mail magazine in lieu of more costly national television advertising 
these favorable variances were partially offset by costs associated with the continued re positioning of our retail idcs to larger and more prominent locations  and increased distribution expenses attributable to higher fuel and freight charges 
the initiative to re position our retail idc network has resulted in higher costs associated with managerial salaries and benefits  occupancy  credit card fees  advertising  and delivery and warehousing 
consolidated operating income was million  or of net sales  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended june   which included restructuring and impairment charges  net of million 
this represents an increase of million  or  which is primarily attributable to lower operating expenses as referred to previously 
wholesale operating income for the year ended june  was million  or of wholesale sales  as compared to million  or of wholesale sales  for the year ended june   which included restructuring and impairment charges  net of million 
the increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to i the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year  ii a decrease in advertising costs  particularly as it relates to national television advertising  iii a reduction in costs associated with excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities  and iv cost savings attributable to the closure of selected plant locations in recent periods 
these decreases were partially offset by i an overall decline in wholesale sales volume  ii price increases within selected raw material categories  iii an increase in selling expenses primarily related to the increased distribution of our direct mail magazine  and iv an increase in distribution expenses attributable to higher fuel and freight charges 
retail operating income increased million  or  to million  or of retail sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of retail sales  in fiscal the increase in retail operating income generated by ethan allen owned idcs is primarily attributable to higher sales volume generated from newly opened including relocations or acquired idcs  and the gain recorded upon the sale of selected idcs 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to the continued re positioning of our retail idc network  and  to a lesser extent  the sell off of floor inventory necessary to make room for new product introductions 
interest and other miscellaneous income net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due  primarily  to a decrease in interest income associated with the lower cash balances maintained during the period  and the favorable settlement of an outstanding legal matter during the prior year period 
income tax expense totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the higher effective tax rate is a result of changes enacted within certain state tax legislation  and increased state income tax liability arising in connection with the operation of a greater number of company owned idcs  some of which are located in new jurisdictions 
for fiscal  we recorded net income of million as compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in fiscal and in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we maintained cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity under a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility includes an accordion feature which provides for an additional million of liquidity  if needed  as well as sub facilities for trade and standby letters of credit of million and swingline loans of million 
the credit facility contains various covenants which may limit our ability to incur debt  engage in mergers and consolidations  make restricted payments  sell certain assets  make investments  and issue stock 
we are also required to meet certain financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  which shall not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on or after june   and a leverage ratio  which shall not be greater than to at any time 
as of june   we had satisfactorily complied with these covenants 
in addition  on september   we completed a private offering of million in ten year senior unsecured notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes were offered by ethan allen global  inc global  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and have an annual coupon rate of 
we intend to utilize the net proceeds of million to expand our retail network  invest in our manufacturing and logistics operations  and for other general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  global  in july and august  entered into separate forward contracts to hedge the risk free interest rate associated with million of the related debt in order to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings  cash flows and equity 
the forward contracts were entered into with a major banking institution thereby mitigating the risk of credit loss 
upon issuance of the senior notes and settlement of the related forward contracts  losses totaling million were incurred representing the change in the fair value of the forward contracts since their respective trade dates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  it was determined that a portion of the related losses was the result of hedge ineffectiveness and  as such  million of the losses was included  within interest and other related financing costs  in the consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended september  the balance of the losses has been included on a net of tax basis in the consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the senior notes 
the remaining unamortized balance of the forward contract losses totaled million as of june  a summary of net cash provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities for each of the last three fiscal years is provided below in millions fiscal year ended june  operating activities net income plus depreciation and amortization

on april   we declared a special  one time cash dividend of per common share  payable on may  to shareholders of record as of may  operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased million as a result  primarily  of increased sales and operating income  and changes in working capital accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  customer deposits  payables  and accrued expenses arising in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  operating cash flow for includes the effects of several non cash items  including the current year restructuring and impairment charge  losses incurred in connection with the sale of certain property  plant and equipment during the period  and compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas r on july  investing activities in fiscal  cash used in investing activities increased million due  primarily  to an increase in cash utilized to fund capital expenditures and acquisition activity  and a decrease in proceeds received upon the sale of certain assets  including selected retail idcs and other property  plant and equipment 
the current level of capital spending is principally attributable to i new idc development and renovation  ii entity wide technology initiatives  and iii improvements within our remaining manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures 
financing activities for fiscal  cash provided by financing activities increased million as a result  primarily  of our receipt of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes  and a reduction in payments related to the acquisition of treasury stock 
cash provided as a result of these items was partially offset by an increase in cash utilized to fund net borrowing activity on our revolving credit facility and pay dividends 
on july   we declared a dividend of per common share  payable on october   to shareholders of record as of october  we expect to continue to declare quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of june   our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations totaled million  the current and long term portions of which amounted to million and million  respectively

while we are not a party to any significant long term supply contracts or purchase commitments  we do  in the normal course of business  regularly initiate purchase orders for the procurement of i selected finished goods sourced from third party vendors  ii lumber  fabric  leather and other raw materials used in production  and iii certain outsourced services 
all purchase orders are based on current needs and are fulfilled by suppliers within short time periods 
at any point in time  our open purchase orders with respect to such goods and services totals approximately million 
further discussion of our contractual obligations associated with outstanding debt and lease arrangements can be found in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our other available sources of liquidity  will be adequate to make all required payments of principal and interest on our debt  to permit anticipated capital expenditures  and to fund working capital and other cash requirements 
as of june   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of to in addition to using available cash to fund changes in working capital  necessary capital expenditures  acquisition activity  the repayment of debt  and the payment of dividends  we have been authorized by our board of directors to repurchase our common stock  from time to time  either directly or through agents  in the open market at prices and on terms satisfactory to us

the forward contracts were entered into with a major banking institution thereby mitigating the risk of credit loss 
upon issuance of the senior notes in september  the related forward contracts were settled 
at the present time we have no current plans to engage in further hedging activities 
we may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  provide guarantees on behalf of selected affiliated entities or become contractually obligated to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain business agreements 
the nature and extent of these guarantees and obligations may vary based on our underlying relationship with the benefiting party and the business purpose for which the guarantee or obligation is being provided 
details of those arrangements for which we act as guarantor or obligor are provided below 
retailer related guarantees we have obligated ourselves  on behalf of one of our independent retailers  with respect to a million credit facility the credit facility comprised of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
this obligation requires us  in the event of the retailer s default under the credit facility  to repurchase the retailer s inventory  applying such purchase price to the retailer s outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility 
our obligation remains in effect for the life of the term loan which expires in april the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under this obligation is limited to the amount outstanding under the credit facility at the time of default subject to pre determined lending limits based on the value of the underlying inventory and  as such  is not an estimate of future cash flows 
no specific recourse or collateral provisions exist that would enable recovery of any portion of amounts paid under this obligation  except to the extent that we maintain the right to take title to the repurchased inventory 
we anticipate that the repurchased inventory could subsequently be sold through our retail idc network 
as of june   the amount outstanding under the credit facility totaled approximately million  of which million was outstanding under the revolving credit line 
based on the underlying creditworthiness of the respective retailer  we believe this obligation will expire without requiring funding by us 
however  in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  a liability has been established to reflect our non contingent obligation under this arrangement as a result of modifications made to the credit facility subsequent to january  as of june   the carrying amount of such liability is less than  indemnification agreement in connection with our joint venture arrangement with united kingdom based mfi furniture group plc  we entered into a tax cross indemnification agreement with the joint venture partner 
the indemnification agreement stipulates that both parties agree to pay fifty percent of the amount of any tax liability arising as a result of i an adverse tax judgment or ii the imposition of additional taxes against either partner  and attributable to the operations of the joint venture 
the indemnification agreement remains in effect until such time that the joint venture is terminated 
in december  both parties mutually agreed to dissolve the joint venture and  as of june   the joint venture had been terminated 
product warranties our products  including our case goods  upholstery and home accents  generally carry explicit product warranties that extend from three to five years and are provided based on terms that are generally accepted in the industry 
all of our domestic independent retailers are required to enter into  and perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a warranty service agreement 
we record provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and make periodic adjustments to those provisions to reflect actual experience 
on rare occasion  certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
in certain cases  a material warranty issue may arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience 
we provide for such warranty issues as they become known and are deemed to be both probable and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that  from time to time  additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of our historical experience 
as of june   the company s product warranty liability totaled million 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our profitability during the last three fiscal years 
in the past  we have generally been able to increase prices or seek lower cost alternatives in order to offset increases in operating costs and effectively manage our working capital 
income taxes at june   we had  for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards nols which expire between and our utilization of million of these nols is limited  pursuant to section c of the internal revenue code irc  based upon the separate earnings and or eventual liquidation of the wholly owned subsidiary to which the nols relate 
the remaining million of nols is subject to an annual limitation under section of the irc 
based on our historical and anticipated future pre tax earnings  we believe that it is more likely than not that these nols will be utilized 
business outlook while we cannot reasonably predict whether the encouraging signs noted during fiscal with respect to the incoming order rate will prove to be sustainable  we believe that we are well positioned for the next phase of economic growth based upon our existing business model which includes i an established brand  ii a comprehensive complement of home decorating solutions  and iii a vertically integrated operating structure 
as macro economic factors change  however  it is also possible that our costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation and benefits  delivery and warehousing  occupancy  and advertising expenses may increase 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the home furnishings industry remains extremely competitive with respect to both the sourcing of products and the retail sale of those products 
domestic manufacturers continue to face pricing pressures as a result of the manufacturing capabilities developed during recent years in other countries  specifically within asia 
in response to these pressures  a large number of us furniture manufacturers and retailers  including us  have increased their overseas sourcing activities in an attempt to maintain a competitive advantage and retain market share 
at the present time  we domestically manufacture and or assemble approximately of our products 
we continue to believe that a balanced approach to product sourcing  which includes the domestic manufacture of certain product offerings coupled with the import of other selected products  provides the greatest degree of flexibility and is the most effective approach to ensuring that acceptable levels of quality  service and value are attained 
in addition  we believe that our retail strategy  which involves i a continued focus on providing a wide array of product solutions and superior customer service  ii the opening of new or relocated idcs in larger and more prominent locations  while encouraging independent retailers to do the same  and iii the development of a more professional management structure within our retail network  provides an opportunity to further grow our business 
further discussion of the home furnishings industry has been included under item of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in a company s financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
if an income tax position exceeds a more likely than not ie greater than probability of success upon tax audit  the company is to recognize an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures consistent with the respective jurisdictional tax laws 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  july  for the company 
as such  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement ie  gross versus net presentation  which relates to sales  use  value added and selected excise taxes assessed by a governmental authority on specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and its customers 
eitf states that the presentation of such taxes  on either a gross or net basis  is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies  if those amounts are significant 
eitf is to be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  january  for the company 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exists primarily through our borrowing activities 
our policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
for floating rate obligations  interest rate changes do not affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate obligations  interest rate changes affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at june   we had no floating rate debt obligations outstanding 
as of that same date  our fixed rate debt obligations consist  primarily  of the senior notes issued on september  the estimated fair value of the senior notes as of june   which is based on interest rate changes subsequent to the date on which the debt was issued  and which has been determined using quoted market prices  was million as compared to a carrying value of million 
foreign currency exchange risk is primarily limited to our operation of ethan allen owned retail idcs located in canada as substantially all purchases of imported parts and finished goods are denominated in united states dollars 
as such  gains or losses resulting from market changes in the value of foreign currencies have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
historically  we have not entered into financial instrument  including derivative  transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate or currency exposure 
however  in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  global  in july and august  entered into separate forward contracts to hedge the risk free interest rate associated with million of the related debt in order to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings  cash flows and equity 
the forward contracts were entered into with a major banking institution thereby mitigating the risk of credit loss 
upon issuance of the senior notes in september  the related forward contracts were settled 
at the present time  we have no current plans to engage in further hedging activities
