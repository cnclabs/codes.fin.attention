discussion of operating results the following table presents net loss income by segment for the years ended december in millions rail air specialty other intersegment income from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss income gatx provides services primarily through three operating segments rail  air  and specialty 
other is comprised of corporate results  including selling  general and administrative expense sg a and interest expense not allocated to segments  and the results of american steamship company asc 
a detailed business description of the company s segments is included in item management evaluates the performance of each segment based on several measures  including net income 
these results are used to assess performance and determine resource allocation among the segments 
corporate sg a relates to administration and support functions performed at the corporate office and include information technology  human resources  legal  tax  financial support and executive costs 
directly attributable expenses are generally allocated to the segments and shared costs are retained in other 
amounts allocated to the segments are approximated based on management s best estimate and judgment of the direct cost of support services 
debt balances and interest expense were allocated based upon a fixed recourse leverage ratio for each individual operating segment across all reporting periods  expressed as a ratio of debt including off balance sheet debt to equity 
unallocated debt and interest were retained in other 
for and  the recourse leverage ratios for rail  air and specialty were set at   and  respectively 
for  rail s recourse leverage ratio was set at  air s recourse leverage ratio was set at and specialty s recourse leverage ratio was set at the reductions to the leverage assumptions at rail and air are reflective of gatx s consolidated leverage position 
management believes this leverage and interest expense allocation methodology provides a reasonable approximation of each operating segment s risk adjusted financial return 
taxes are recorded in each segment based on the segment s operating results and the relative tax rates in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
gatx s financial performance measures the following table presents financial measures for the company based on financial data derived from the financial statements and non gaap components 
for additional information on the company s use of non gaap components  see non gaap financial performance measures on page all amounts and ratios are based on continuing operations 
the return measures were negatively affected by the impairment charges recorded in the air segment in the fourth quarter of the return measures were positively affected by certain non operating events occurring in the fourth quarter of  including the gain from the sale of a staten island property  insurance recoveries and certain tax benefits return on equity return on assets sg a efficiency gatx rail the north american railcar market was extremely active in industry wide indicators  such as railcar loadings and ton miles  were at historically high levels 
utilization of rail s railcar fleet remained high at and lease rates increased over levels 
rail maintained its utilization throughout the entire year of through successful renewals of leases with current lessees  assignments of railcars whose lease term had expired with new lessees  and the scrapping of older  generally inactive railcars 
the current market conditions have enabled rail to put a greater emphasis on renewing contracts with current customers at attractive lease rates while also extending lease term 
rail anticipates that this strategy should help reduce future revenue volatility 
in addition  renewals of existing leases typically result in lower maintenance and transition costs than if the railcars are assigned to new customers 
based on current market conditions and industry forecasts of future activity  rail believes that the favorable north american railcar market conditions will generally result in increased lease rates on railcars scheduled for renewal in in north america  rail acquired  new and used railcars in high demand and high steel prices have increased current market prices for both new and used railcars 
in  rail entered into committed purchase contracts committed purchase program with two railcar manufacturers in order to secure favorable pricing for new railcar purchases in exchange for specific volume purchase commitments 
the committed purchase program has enabled rail to purchase new railcars at a lower price than would otherwise have been available in the spot market 
rail s purchases of new railcars in were primarily under the committed purchase program 
rail will continue to invest in the north american market during through the use of the committed purchase program as well as through select portfolio purchases 
costs for maintaining the north american fleet continued to increase in  primarily due to increased maintenance activity relating to the conversion of railcars for use in different types of services which also increases their marketability  increased regulatory requirements and a larger fleet 
the trend of increasing maintenance costs is expected to continue in due to the past and planned future growth in the size of the fleet as well as price increases for railcar components and an anticipated increase in certain types of higher cost repairs 
additional security and safety regulations  if enacted  may likewise increase future maintenance costs 
in december  rail purchased the remaining interest in its locomotive leasing partners llc llp joint venture  which was established to refurbish and lease locomotives 
in  the earnings of the locomotive business are fully consolidated in rail s operating results  whereas in  only of the earnings from the llp were reflected 
rail expects to continue to expand its locomotive business in rail s european operations also benefited from improved market conditions during rates on new and renewed leases increased over expiring rates  however at a lesser increment than north american rates 
rail expects this trend to continue in as the european union eu is encouraging the use of railways due to its congested road system 
poland and nine other countries joined the eu in this is expected to eventually lead to more seamless borders  upgraded infrastructure and improved rail efficiencies in those countries 
during  rail placed new cars in its primary markets of austria  germany and poland and successfully expanded into the romanian market 
rail expects to make further investments in these markets during and will evaluate other european markets for selected expansion in the future 
utilization in europe was up from at the end of to at the end of during  major steps were taken at rail s polish subsidiary to transition lease contracts from a trip lease pay as used business model to a term rental business model 
this transition culminated with the signing of term rental agreements in late with its two largest customers 
as a result of this effort  redundant repair centers were closed  reducing operating costs and making additional cars available for lease in integration of rail s european operations continued during and resulted in additional cost reductions  improved fleet utilization and other process efficiencies 
the impact of these actions is expected to be fully realized in the aae cargo aae affiliate also experienced strong demand for its fleet  particularly intermodal railcars  due to high seaport volumes  growth in container freight traffic  and increased demand from private operators

well publicized railroad derailments  some of which involved gatx railcars  have focused attention on safety issues associated with the transportation of hazardous materials 
these incidents have led to calls for increased regulation to address safety and security issues associated with the transportation of hazardous materials 
suggested remedial measures vary  but include rerouting hazardous material railcar movements  increasing the inspection authority of the federal railroad administration fra  addressing the physical condition of tank cars  and revising manufacturing specifications for high pressure tank cars which carry hazardous materials 
specific focus has been directed at pressurized railcars built prior to that were manufactured with non normalized steel 
the national transportation safety board ntsb issued a report in recommending that the fra conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of pressurized tank cars built prior to  use the results of that analysis to rank cars according to risk and to implement measures to eliminate or mitigate such risks 
to date  the ntsb has not recommended that pressure cars built prior to be removed from service  nor has the fra issued any orders curtailing use of these cars 
the fra s analysis is ongoing 
in addition  legislation has been introduced at the state and federal level  which if adopted  would affect pressurized tank cars manufactured before for use in the transportation of hazardous materials 
specifically  in july  federal legislation was passed which requires the fra to within one year validate a predictive model to quantify the relevant dynamic forces acting on railroad tank cars under accident conditions  within eighteen months initiate rulemaking to develop and implement an appropriate design standard for pressurized tank cars and within one year conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of steel shells of pre built pressurized tank cars 
the company owns or leases approximately  pre built pressurized tank cars in north america of its north american fleet 
the company is actively working with trade associations and others to participate in the legislative and regulatory process affecting rail transportation of hazardous materials 
however  at this time the affect on gatx of the mandates made on the fra in the recently adopted legislation  the probability of adoption of similar legislation and the resulting impact on gatx should such legislation be adopted cannot be reasonably determined 
in january of  the tank car committee of the association of american railroads aar initiated dockets to develop new performance standards for tank cars that transport two hazardous materials  chlorine and anhydrous ammonia 
the tank car committee is a standing committee within the aar safety and operations department and develops and publishes specifications for the design  construction  maintenance and operation of tank cars 
the dockets are pending before two task forces comprised of tank car committee members 
these task forces are charged with developing performance standards for tank cars that would substantially reduce the probability of a release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the event of a rail accident 
in the event new performance standards are adopted  the aar has stated that within five to seven years it will seek to replace the existing fleet of tank cars carrying these materials with tank cars that meet the new specifications 
the company owns or leases approximately  cars that carry these materials 
the adoption of new standards will require significant technical and regulatory agency review 
it is not known if or when such standards will be adopted or the actual specifications that will be mandated 
as a consequence  the impact to gatx cannot be determined at this time 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  summary net income of million in increased million from the prior year 
the increase was driven primarily by higher lease and asset remarketing income as the rail market continued to improve  partially offset by higher maintenance and ownership costs 
gross income rail s gross income of million was million higher than due primarily to a larger fleet  a favorable lease rate environment  higher asset remarketing activity primarily related to a gain on the sale of certain locomotives  and higher customer and railroad damage reimbursements and third party repairs 
lease income was higher in both north american and european markets 
the north american railcar operations contributed approximately million in additional lease income during north american renewal and assignment activity was strong in and utilization remained at 
rail s secondary market acquisitions and new railcar investments increased the average size of the active fleet by approximately  railcars over  leading to a corresponding increase in lease income 
in  lease rates continued to improve as the average renewal rate on a basket of common railcar types increased versus the expiring rate 
the full impact of these higher rate leases will be reflected in rail s financial results 
gatx expects lease rate increases to continue in as of the north american fleet is scheduled for renewal 
lease income also increased million from as a result of the locomotive business 
no lease income from locomotives was reported in as rail s share of llp s results was reported in share of affiliates earnings 
rail s european leasing operations also improved during  where an increase in the average active fleet of  railcars along with rising lease rates and stronger foreign currency exchange rates contributed an additional million in lease income over these results reflect rail s success in new markets  expanded investment in current markets  and the transition of its polish subsidiary leasing model 
asset remarketing income in increased compared to  primarily due to a gain from the sale of certain six axle locomotives 
other income of million increased million from due primarily to higher revenue from customer and railroad damage reimbursements and third party repairs 
costs associated with this repair work are included in maintenance expense 
this increase was partially offset by lower scrapping gains resulting from the combination of higher net book values of scrapped cars and fewer railcars scrapped in rail expects its volume of railcar scrappings to continue to decline in share of affiliates earnings of million was million lower than the prior year 
included the results of the llp joint venture  which contributed million 
additionally included the write off of a non core logistics investment 
excluding these factors  share of affiliates earnings increased million due to improved results at rail s aae affiliate 
ownership costs the increase in ownership costs of million in was primarily due to the impact of significant investment volume throughout and  and the consolidation of llp 
this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates resulting from improved credit spreads 
the mix of ownership costs was affected by the combined effects of the increase in the size of gatx s worldwide fleet over and and the sale and leaseback of railcars with a net book value of million in other costs and expenses maintenance expense in increased million from as a result of the combination of several factors 
comparability between years is impacted by repairs mandated by aar regulatory actions in north america in each year 
maintenance expense in included million to inspect or replace certain bolsters  while included an incremental million of expense related to wheel set replacements 
maintenance expense also increased in due to a larger fleet  higher railcar conversion costs and third party repair expenses 
repairs of railcars damaged by railroads or customers  the reimbursement of which is included in other income  also contributed to the increase 
in europe  favorable maintenance costs were partially offset by the effect of stronger foreign currency exchange rates 
as previously discussed herein  rail expects maintenance costs in to increase from levels 
other costs and expenses of million in increased million from the increase is primarily due to million of debt extinguishment costs related to the termination of a structured financing in canada  which was an important component of a company wide initiative to repatriate foreign earnings in asset impairment charges of million were million higher than this increase is primarily due to the additional write down taken on a north american repair facility held for sale and the write down of certain locomotives in europe also held for sale

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  summary net income of million in increased million from the prior year 
the increase in was driven primarily by higher lease income and higher asset remarketing income for both rail and its affiliates  as the rail market continued to improve  and larger gains on scrapping of railcars as a result of higher steel prices  partially offset by higher maintenance and ownership costs 
gross income rail s gross income of million was million higher than due primarily to favorable north american market conditions and higher scrapping gains resulting from higher scrap metal prices 
north american renewal and assignment activity was strong in and the active fleet increased by approximately  railcars 
rail s secondary market acquisitions and new railcar investments significantly contributed to the increase in active cars and the corresponding increase in lease income 
north american utilization improved to at december  representing approximately  railcars on lease compared to at december  in  the average renewal rate on a basket of common railcar types increased versus the expiring rate  with this improvement largely attributable to activity in the second half of the year 
also favorably impacting rail s gross income was the impact of foreign exchange rates 
rail s european rail operations improved during the course of the year 
utilization rates remained high and operations were positively impacted by success in new markets and the placement of new car deliveries 
asset remarketing income in primarily included a gain on the sale of railcars  residual sharing fees from a managed portfolio and other residual sharing fees 
asset remarketing income in included the gain on disposition of a leveraged lease commitment on passenger rail equipment 
other income of million increased million from due primarily to higher scrapping gains as the price of steel increased significantly from share of affiliates earnings of million were higher than the prior year 
the increase was the result of significant asset remarketing gains at domestic and foreign affiliates 
ownership costs ownership costs were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of significant investment volume in through new car and secondary market acquisitions  rail purchased approximately  railcars and  railcars in north america and europe  respectively 
other costs and expenses maintenance expense of million in increased million from maintenance costs increased sharply for a variety of reasons  including costs associated with assignments  moving cars from idle to active service and continuing regulatory compliance 
as railcars move from idle to active service  repairs and improvements  such as replacement of tank car linings and valves  are often required 
although fewer cars were repaired  the cost per car increased due to the nature of the repairs 
during  the aar issued an early warning letter that required all owners of railcars in the united states  canada and mexico to inspect or replace certain bolsters manufactured from the mid s to by a now bankrupt supplier 
rail owned approximately  railcars equipped with bolsters that were required to be inspected or replaced 
approximately  of rail s affected railcars are on full service leases in which case rail is responsible for the costs of inspection or replacement 
as of december   bolsters on  cars have been replaced 
the cost attributable to the inspection and replacement of bolsters was million in  a decrease of million from the prior year period

gatx air airline industry market conditions improved in according to airline industry data  worldwide revenue passenger miles increased in aircraft lease rates are recovering from the low levels of recent years 
while airlines remained under financial pressure due to intense competition and rising fuel costs  there were relatively fewer credit defaults  bankruptcies and liquidations 
additionally  new airlines were able to raise capital to support entry into the industry  particularly in foreign markets 
air plans to capitalize on the strengthening market by extending the average lease term on its remaining fleet and improving other conditions of its leases  such as maintenance reserve levels and security deposits  and shifting more transition costs to aircraft operators 
aircraft on lease comprise nearly of the fleet  and remarketing pressures have eased as many customers are choosing to extend existing leases at higher rates 
in  air was able to leverage its industry expertise by identifying aircraft management opportunities with various financial institutions 
these management engagements involve remarketing  repossession  and sale efforts on behalf of clients 
fee income in was million  a improvement over the prior year 
fees from current partnership activities will decrease in the future as a result of the previously discussed aircraft sales 
however  in air expects to more than offset this decrease with other fees as it focuses resources toward pursuing additional aircraft management engagements 
during  air completed a comprehensive evaluation of its aircraft and aircraft investments and as a result identified aircraft  comprised of wholly owned and held by affiliates  for disposition and is evaluating disposition alternatives for its investment in pembroke group  a owned affiliate that owns aircraft 
aircraft and or affiliate dispositions are largely expected to be completed during air recognized impairment losses of million million after tax in associated with these actions 
the assets identified for disposition primarily consist of older or less desirable aircraft 
the details and results of gatx s impairment review are more completely discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
after completion of the disposition process  air s remaining portfolio will consist of newer  more desirable aircraft 
the improved asset mix  coupled with the ability to focus greater resources on expanding aircraft management opportunities  is expected to improve air s profitability and financial returns

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  summary net loss was million in compared to net income of million in the prior year 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to impairment losses recorded on twelve wholly owned aircraft and on the company s investments in five joint ventures 
gross income air s gross income of million was million lower than the decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings from affiliates due to impairments 
excluding the effects of the impairments  gross income was million  an increase of million primarily driven by higher lease income and the significant increase in fee income 
lease income increased primarily due to the impact of higher rents on variable rate leases  which are indexed to market interest rates 
lease income also increased due to the full year recognition of lease income on three new aircraft  which were delivered at various times during  and higher rates on certain renewed lease contracts 
the increase in lease income was offset partially by a lower rental rate for a restructured lease with bankrupt carrier ata holdings and lower rates on lease extensions of certain older aircraft that were subsequently targeted for disposition 
air expects lease income to increase next year as a result of the full year effect of variable rate leases that repriced in in addition  based on current market conditions  aircraft scheduled for renewal in are expected to renew or re lease at higher rental rates 
the timing of the dispositions of the held for sale aircraft may also impact lease income in asset remarketing income decreased in due to lower realized gains on the sale of aircraft in during  air was able to leverage its expertise in managing and remarketing aircraft on behalf of its affiliates as well as other third parties 
these efforts resulted in fee income of million in air expects its fee income to increase in as it allocates resources toward expanding aircraft management opportunities 
share of affiliates earnings decreased from the prior year primarily due to asset impairment charges of million relating to affiliate aircraft and affiliate investments targeted for disposition in excluding these impairment losses  share of affiliates earnings increased million from the prior year primarily due to stronger earnings from several of air s other affiliates  particularly the rolls royce engine leasing affiliate and the new alster and thames partners affiliate 
the increase was partially offset by a million impairment loss at the pembroke group affiliate that was recognized on its three aircraft on lease to delta related to the airline s bankruptcy proceedings 
earnings from affiliates will continue to be affected in by the timing of aircraft and or affiliate dispositions and the absence of depreciation for certain aircraft held for sale  as well as by the resulting final disposition gains and or losses 
ownership costs ownership costs of million in were million higher than in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense  which was primarily due to higher interest rates on debt associated with variable rate leases and was partially offset by lower average outstanding debt 
operating lease expense increased million primarily due to a million loss on a restructured sublease to ata holdings 
ownership costs in are expected to decrease principally as a result of the absence of depreciation on held for sale aircraft and the absence of the ata loss 
depreciation expense in on the aircraft held for sale was million 
interest expense is also expected to decrease as a result of lower debt levels as proceeds associated with aircraft and or affiliate dispositions will be used to reduce debt 
other costs and expenses total other costs and expenses of million in were million higher than in primarily due to asset impairment charges of million related to the write down of the aircraft held for sale 
impairment charges in also included a write down of million related to aircraft spare parts 
asset impairment charges in may reflect gains or losses as held for sale aircraft fair value reassessments and or final disposition results are recognized

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  summary net income of million in increased million from the prior year primarily due to gains on the sale of aircraft and the negative effect in of a loss on an unsecured air canada note 
profit was also driven by strong joint venture performance  particularly at the rolls royce engine leasing affiliate 
gross income air s gross income of million was million higher than the increase was primarily driven by higher lease and asset remarketing income 
lease income increased primarily due to the full year revenue recognition on six new aircraft that were delivered at various times during and the purchase and lease of three new aircraft along with the purchase of four aircraft subject to existing leases in lease income in on the new aircraft purchases in and was approximately million 
the impact in of higher rents on variable rates leases  which are indexed to market interest rates  was million 
these increases were offset by early lease terminations and lower lease rates on certain renewed lease contracts 
asset remarketing income increased as the result of gains from the sale of four aircraft in share of affiliates earnings decreased from the prior year primarily due to asset impairments at the pembroke group in  more than offsetting continued strong performance at the rolls royce engine leasing joint venture

the venture finance portfolio has been substantially liquidated and as of december   consists primarily of million of investments 
specialty is pursuing new investment opportunities  focusing on marine assets and other long lived industrial equipment in targeted mature industries 
during  specialty invested approximately million in these asset types 
prospectively  it is expected that specialty s asset levels will grow based on anticipated new investment volume 
such investments may be originated through direct or indirect channels 
future revenues may continue to be uneven due to the uncertain timing of asset remarketing income  fees and gains from the sales of securities

while specialty expects anticipated investment volume in to fuel growth in its loan  lease and affiliate income  net income in is expected to be lower than primarily due to an expected decline in asset remarketing gains 
gross income specialty s gross income of million was million higher than the increase was primarily the result of higher asset remarketing income and share of affiliates earnings  offset by lower interest and fee income 
asset remarketing income increased million from and was comprised of both gains from the sale of assets from specialty s owned portfolio as well as residual sharing fees from the sale of managed assets 
because the timing of such sales is dependent on market conditions  asset remarketing income does not occur evenly from period to period 
the increase of million in share of affiliates earnings is primarily attributable to high freight rates and utilization of vessels in the marine joint ventures 
lower anticipated shipping activity in  compared to the historical highs achieved in  is expected to lead to reduced marine affiliate income for the year 
the decrease of million in interest income was primarily the result of lower loan balances due to repayments in and fee income decreased million due to large asset management fees received in ownership costs ownership costs of million in were million lower than due to lower interest expense resulting from a smaller investment portfolio and lower debt balances 
other costs and expenses other costs and expenses of million in were million higher than primarily as a result of a decrease in the reversal of provision for possible losses 
specialty reversed million less in provision for possible losses in versus the reversals in both years were primarily due to favorable credit experience during the run off of the venture finance portfolio and improvements in overall portfolio quality 
no further reversals of the provision for losses are expected in additionally  other operating costs increased in related to a marine operation that experienced higher utilization levels

balance sheet discussion assets total assets of continuing operations were billion at december  compared to billion at december  decreases in operating lease assets and investments in affiliated companies were partially offset by increases in cash  receivables and other assets 
in addition to its assets recorded on the balance sheet  gatx utilizes approximately billion of other assets  such as railcars and aircraft  which were financed with operating leases and therefore are not recorded on the balance sheet 
the off balance sheet assets represent the present value of gatx s committed future operating lease payments using a discount rate

allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses on gross receivables 
in addition to establishing loss estimates for known troubled accounts  this estimate involves consideration of historical loss experience  judgments about the impact of present economic conditions  collateral values  and the state of the markets in which gatx operates 
this overall allowance for possible losses is measured and reported as a percentage of gross receivables 
the following summarizes changes in gatx s consolidated allowance for possible losses as of december in millions balance at the beginning of the year reversal of provision for possible losses charges to allowance recoveries and other balance at end of the year the following table presents the allowance for possible losses by segment as of december in millions rail air specialty other the allowance for possible losses is reviewed regularly for adequacy by considering changes in economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the receivables portfolio as of december  the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  which could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
the allowance for possible losses of million at december  decreased million from and represented of gross receivables  compared to in the prior year 
the decrease of allowance for possible losses as a percentage of gross receivables in reflects the general improvement in the credit quality of gatx s portfolio as well as the better than expected performance and run off of venture finance assets  which were reserved at a relatively higher rate than the rest of the portfolio 
net charge offs  which is calculated as charge offs less recoveries excluding other  totaled million for the year  an improvement of million from the charge offs to the allowance in were substantially related to specialty s venture finance portfolio 
operating lease assets  facilities and other net operating lease assets and facilities decreased million from the decrease was primarily related to the following activities during the air reclassed aircraft with a pre impairment net book value of million to assets held for sale and transferred million of aircraft to an affiliate in which gatx has a interest  rail completed a sale leaseback for million of railcars and sold million of railcars and locomotives  depreciation contributed million 
partially offsetting the decrease were investments by rail and specialty of million and million  respectively 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies decreased million in primarily due to the million impairment charge taken on aircraft assets targeted for disposition

cash flow discussion gatx generates a significant amount of cash from its operating activities and proceeds from its investment portfolio  which is used to service debt  pay dividends  and fund portfolio investments and capital additions 
net cash provided by continuing operations net cash provided by continuing operations of million decreased million compared to excluding the impact of insurance proceeds of million and income tax refunds of million received in  operating cash flow increased by million  benefiting from higher lease income  partially offset by debt management costs and higher operating lease payments 
portfolio investments and capital additions portfolio investments and capital additions primarily consist of purchases of operating lease assets  investments in joint ventures  loans and capitalized asset improvements 
portfolio investments and capital additions of million decreased million from rail invested million in  a decrease of million from the prior year 
high steel prices and intense competition for railcar acquisitions in the secondary markets have made it challenging to find attractive new investments 
portfolio investments and capital additions at air of million were million lower than the prior year 
lower investment volume in was due to limited available aircraft investment opportunities at an acceptable risk adjusted rate of return 
gatx did not acquire any aircraft in compared to seven deliveries three of which were new aircraft in specialty invested million in  an increase of million from the prior year 
significant activity at specialty included the funding of an interest in a new marine joint venture and investments in select long lived industrial equipment 
the following table presents portfolio investments and capital additions by segment in millions rail air specialty other future portfolio investments and capital additions excluding contractual commitments will depend on market conditions and opportunities to acquire desirable assets 
portfolio proceeds portfolio proceeds primarily consist of loan and finance lease receipts  proceeds from asset remarketing and sales of securities  and capital distributions from affiliates 
portfolio proceeds of million decreased million from the decrease was primarily due to a decline in loan payments received  related to a reduction in the loan portfolio  and lower distributions from affiliates 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from asset remarketing 
asset remarketing proceeds included million related to the transfer of four aircraft to a newly formed joint venture in which the company has a interest 
portfolio proceeds were as follows for the years ended december in millions finance lease rents received  net of earned income and leveraged lease nonrecourse debt service loan principal received proceeds from asset remarketing proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities capital distributions from affiliates proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and other asset sales in  the company completed a sale leaseback transaction for approximately  of its railcars net book value of million for net proceeds of million

in addition  rail s canadian subsidiary executed a private placement for million of unsecured debt with a ten year term and scheduled amortization  guaranteed by gatx s wholly owned subsidiary  gatx financial corporation gfc 
the proceeds from the debt issuances were primarily used to repay existing debt and to fund a dividend from its canadian subsidiary 
repayments of debt were million in the majority of the debt repaid consisted of scheduled maturities 
additionally  as part of a debt management strategy to reduce interest costs and to realign future maturities  the company completed a bond tender for an aggregate principal amount of million for certain notes scheduled to mature in and prepaid million of certain other debt scheduled to mature after liquidity and capital resources general gatx s operating subsidiaries fund investments and meet debt  lease and dividend obligations through cash from operating activities  portfolio proceeds including proceeds from asset sales  commercial paper issuances  uncommitted money market lines  committed revolving credit facilities and the issuance of secured and unsecured debt

this new five year senior unsecured revolving facility expires in june and replaced the million three year revolving credit facility previously in place 
at december   availability of the credit facility was million  with million of letters of credit issued and backed by the facility 
these sources of cash are typically used to fund daily operations  and accumulate until they are paid down using cash flow or proceeds of long term debt issuance 
restrictive covenants gfc is subject to various restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain a defined net worth and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  there are certain negative pledge provisions  including an asset coverage test 
gfc does not anticipate any covenant violation in the credit facility  bank financings  or indenture  or other financings  nor does gfc anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict its operations or its ability to procure additional financing 
debt financing during  all of gatx s debt issuance was at gfc and its subsidiaries 
secured financings are comprised of the sale leaseback of railcars and loans secured by railcars and aircraft 
the railcar sale leasebacks qualify as operating leases and the assets or liabilities associated with this equipment are not recorded on the balance sheet 
as of december   gfc had a shelf registration for billion of debt securities and pass through certificates  of which million of senior unsecured notes had been issued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information on gatx s credit facilities  debt obligations and related restrictive covenants 
subsequent to december   gfc issued million of senior unsecured debt with a coupon and a ten year term 
credit ratings the availability of gatx s funding options may be affected by certain factors including the global capital market environment and outlook as well as gfc s financial performance 
access to capital markets at competitive rates is dependent on gfc s credit rating and rating outlook  as determined by rating agencies such as standard poor s s p and moody s investor service moody s 
subsequent to december   s p upgraded its credit rating on gfc s long term unsecured debt to bbb from bbb and changed gfc s rating outlook to stable 
also  s p s credit rating for short term unsecured debt was upgraded to a from a during the year  moody s modified gfc s rating outlook from stable to positive  while its credit rating on gfc s long term unsecured debt remained unchanged at baa throughout  gfc s commercial paper credit ratings of a s p and p moody s restricted gfc s ability to utilize the commercial paper market as a source of funding 
despite these restrictions  at various times during  gfc had in excess of million of commercial paper outstanding 
the upgraded s p rating on gfc s short term  unsecured debt is positive  however gfc s access to the commercial paper market may continue to be restricted as a result of moody s p rating 
liquidity position gfc expects that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations for through a combination of projected cash from operating activities  portfolio proceeds and its revolving credit facilities

convertible securities in august  gatx completed a private offering of million long term  senior unsecured notes which are convertible into gatx corporation common stock 
as of december   the notes were convertible at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment based on various factors  including changes in the dividend on gatx s common stock 
holders of the notes have the right to require all or a portion of the notes to be purchased at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest in august  august  and august any required purchases in august  will be payable in cash  whereas any purchases in august or august may be paid in cash or shares of gatx common stock or any combination thereof  at gatx s option 
gatx also has the right  beginning in august  to redeem the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if gatx provides notice of redemption  the holders of the notes may elect to exercise their conversion privilege 
upon conversion  gatx may elect  at its option  to deliver cash  shares of gatx common stock or any combination thereof 
in february  gatx completed a private offering of million of long term  senior unsecured convertible notes 
the five year notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into gatx corporation common stock at a price of per share 
unconditional purchase obligations at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations of million consisted primarily of commitments to purchase railcars and aircraft 
gatx had commitments of million related to the committed railcar purchase program entered into in gatx also had commitments of million for orders on three new aircraft to be delivered in and additional unconditional purchase obligations include million of other rail related commitments 
at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations by segment were in millions payments due by period total thereafter rail air specialty future cash inflows the company s primary projected cash inflow commitments arising from minimum future lease receipts from finance leases  net of debt payments for leveraged leases  and minimum future rental receipts from noncancelable operating leases as of december  were as follows in millions projected cash inflow commitments by period total thereafter finance leases operating leases  total  guarantees in connection with certain investments or transactions  gatx has entered into various commercial commitments  such as guarantees and standby letters of credit  which could require performance in the event of demands by third parties 
similar to gatx s balance sheet investments  these guarantees expose gatx to credit  market and equipment risk  accordingly  gatx evaluates its commitments and other contingent obligations using techniques similar to those used to evaluate funded transactions 
affiliate guarantees generally involve guaranteeing repayment of the financing utilized to acquire or lease in assets being leased by an affiliate to customers  and are in lieu of making direct equity investments in the affiliate 
gatx is not aware of any event of default which would require it to satisfy these guarantees  and expects the affiliates to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy their lease and loan obligations 
asset residual value guarantees represent gatx s commitment to third parties that an asset or group of assets will be worth a specified amount at the end of a lease term 
approximately of the company s asset residual value guarantees are related to rail equipment 
based on known facts and current market conditions  management does not believe that the asset residual value guarantees will result in any negative financial impact to gatx 
historically  gains associated with the residual value guarantees have exceeded any losses incurred 
gatx believes these asset residual value guarantees will likely generate future income in the form of fees and residual sharing proceeds 
lease payment guarantees represent gatx s guarantees to financial institutions of finance and operating lease payments of an unrelated party in exchange for a fee 
other guarantees consists of gatx s indemnification of airbus industrie airbus related to the dissolution of flightlease holdings limited fhg and the allocation by airbus of million of pre delivery payments to gatx towards the purchase of aircraft in these pre delivery payments are also the subject of active litigation as discussed in item legal proceedings 
no liability has been recorded with respect to this indemnification as gatx believes that the likelihood of having to perform under the indemnity is remote 
gatx and its subsidiaries are also parties to standing letters of credit and bonds primarily related to workers compensation and general liability insurance coverages 
no material claims have been made against these obligations 
at december   gatx does not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments because performance is not anticipated to be required 
gatx s commercial commitments at december  were in millions amount of commitment expiration by period total thereafter affiliate guarantees asset residual value guarantees lease payment guarantees other guarantees a guarantees standby letters of credit and bonds a no specific maturity date 
pension contributions in  gatx contributed million to its funded and unfunded pension plans 
in  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million with respect to its pension plans 
additional contributions will be dependent on a number of factors including plan asset investment returns and actuarial experience 
subject to the impact of these factors  the company may make additional material plan contributions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant factors and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as critical accounting policies operating lease assets and facilities operating lease assets and facilities are stated principally at cost 
assets acquired under capital leases are included in operating lease assets and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
provisions for depreciation include the amortization of the cost of capital leases 
certain operating lease assets and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method to an estimated residual value 
railcars  locomotives  aircraft  marine vessels  buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the appropriateness of depreciable lives and residual values based on physical and economic factors  as well as existing market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  gatx performs a review for impairment of long lived assets  such as operating lease assets and facilities  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimated future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease term  operating costs  life of the asset and disposition proceeds 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
fair value is based on internal estimates supplemented with independent appraisals and or market comparables when available and appropriate 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
impairment of investments in affiliated companies in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  gatx reviews the carrying amount of its investments in affiliates annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred 
if management determines that indicators of impairment are present  an analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of the investment 
management defines fair value  for purposes of this policy  as the price that would be received for an investment in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller 
while quoted prices in active markets provide the best evidence of fair value  an active market does not exist for the majority of our joint venture investments 
thus an estimate of their fair value must be made 
some examples of acceptable valuation techniques that gatx may use to estimate fair value are discounted cash flows at the investee level  capitalized earnings or the present value of expected distributable cash from the investee 
additionally  price earnings ratios based on comparable businesses may also be acceptable in certain circumstances 
other valuation techniques that are appropriate for the particular circumstances of a joint venture and for which sufficient data are available may also be used 
once an estimate of fair value is obtained it is compared to the investment s carrying value 
if the investment s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  then the investment is impaired 
if an investment is impaired  then a determination is made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors that management considers in making this determination include expected operating results for the near future  the length of the economic life cycle of the underlying assets of the business and the ability of the company to hold the investment through the end of the underlying assets useful life 
anticipated management actions that are probable of being taken that may improve the business prospects of the investee are also considered 
if management reasonably determines an investment to be temporarily impaired  no impairment loss would be recorded 
alternatively  if management determines that an investment is impaired on an other than temporary basis  a loss equal to the difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying value is recorded in the period of identification 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  gatx reviews the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the impairment review is performed at the reporting unit level  which is one level below an operating segment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process and requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts 
management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit s carrying amount  which includes goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  an additional step is performed that compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of the goodwill requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in the period of identification 
pension and post retirement benefits assumptions gatx s pension and post retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
gatx evaluates these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality  turnover  health care cost trends and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and post retirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the guideline for establishing this rate is high quality  long term bond rates 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions 
income taxes gatx evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing the likelihood of whether deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforward benefits  will be realized in the future 
the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required involves judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives  if applicable 
taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the company has historically maintained that undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates were intended to be permanently reinvested in those foreign operations 
if in the future  these earnings are repatriated to the us  or if the company expects such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  provision for additional taxes would be required 
gatx s operations are subject to taxes in the us  various states and foreign countries and as result  may be subject to audit in all of these jurisdictions 
tax audits may involve complex issues and disagreements with taxing authorities could require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and assessments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audit issues 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting pronouncements that may impact gatx s business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  gatx is exposed to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate  and equity price risks that could impact results of operations 
to manage these risks  gatx  pursuant to authorized policies  may enter into certain derivative transactions  principally interest rate swaps  treasury note derivatives and currency swaps 
these instruments and other derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes only to manage existing underlying exposures 
gatx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure gatx s interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate debt instruments 
based on gatx s variable rate debt instruments at december  and giving affect to related derivatives  if market rates were to increase hypothetically by basis points  after tax interest expense would increase by approximately million in functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposure gatx conducts operations in foreign countries  principally europe and canada 
as a result  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies would affect gatx s reported earnings 
based on reported earnings from continuing operations  a uniform and hypothetical strengthening in the us dollar versus applicable foreign currencies would decrease after tax income from continuing operations in by approximately million 
the interpretation and analysis of the results from the hypothetical changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates should not be considered in isolation  such changes would typically have corresponding offsetting effects 
for example  offsetting effects are present to the extent that floating rate debt is associated with floating rate assets 
equity price exposure gatx also has equity price risk inherent in stock and warrants of companies in which it has investments 
at december   the fair value of the stock and warrants was million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical change in value from a sensitivity test would not be material to gatx operations
