item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
except for the historical financial information contained herein  the matters discussed below may be considered forward looking statements 
please see cautionary statement about forward looking statements  for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of contract oil and natural gas drilling services  primarily in the united states us gulf of mexico shallow water and inland marine region  an area that we refer to as the us gulf coast 
we provide these services primarily to independent oil and natural gas companies  but we also service major international and government controlled oil and natural gas companies 
our customers in the us gulf coast typically focus on drilling for natural gas 
we provide contract oil and gas drilling and other support services and report the results of those operations in four business segments which  for our contract drilling services  correspond to the principal geographic regions in which we operate us gulf of mexico segment we currently operate jackup and three submersible rigs in the us gulf of mexico shallow water market which begins at the outer limit of the transition zone and extends to water depths of about feet 
our jackup rigs in this market consist of independent leg cantilever type units  mat supported cantilever type rigs and mat supported slot type jackup rigs that can operate in water depths up to feet 
us inland barge segment our barge rig fleet currently operating in this market consists of conventional and posted barge rigs 
these units operate in marshes  rivers  lakes and shallow bay or coastal waterways that are known as the transition zone 
this area along the us gulf coast  where jackup rigs are unable to operate  is the world s largest market for this type of equipment 
other international segment our other operations are currently conducted in angola  colombia  mexico  trinidad and venezuela 
we operate one jackup rig in angola and one jackup rig in colombia 
in mexico  we operate two jackup rigs and a platform rig 
we have two jackup rigs and a land rig in trinidad and eight land rigs in venezuela 
we may pursue selected opportunities in other international areas from time to time 
delta towing segment during  we had a interest in delta towing  a joint venture that operates a fleet of us marine support vessels consisting primarily of shallow water tugs  crewboats and utility barges 
in january  we purchased the interest owned by chouest 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
our operating revenues for our drilling segments are based on dayrates received for our drilling services and the number of operating days during the relevant periods 
the level of our operating revenues depends on dayrates  which in turn are primarily a function of industry supply and demand for drilling units in the market segments in which we operate 
supply and demand for drilling units in the us gulf coast  which is our primary operating region  has historically been volatile 
during periods of high demand  our rigs typically achieve higher utilization and dayrates than during periods of low demand 
our operating and maintenance costs for our drilling segments represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling rigs 
the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits  freight costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  general taxes and licenses  boat and helicopter rentals  communications  tool rentals and services 
labor  repair and maintenance and insurance costs represent the most significant components of our operating and maintenance costs 
operating and maintenance expenses may not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues because we generally seek to preserve crew continuity and maintain equipment when our rigs are idle 
in general  labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and inflation 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
industry background  trends and outlook the drilling industry in the us gulf coast is highly cyclical and is typically driven by general economic activity and changes in actual or anticipated oil and gas prices 
we believe that both our earnings and demand for our rigs will typically be correlated to our customers expectations of energy prices  particularly natural gas prices  and that sustained energy price increases will generally have a positive impact on our earnings 
we believe there are several trends in our industry that could effect our operations  including high natural gas prices 
while us natural gas prices are volatile  the rolling twelve month average price of natural gas has increased from in january to in january high natural gas prices in the united states have resulted in more exploration and development drilling activity and higher utilization and dayrates for drilling companies like us 
if high natural gas prices are sustained  we expect this trend to continue 
need for increased natural gas drilling activity 
from to  us demand for natural gas grew at an annual rate of while its supply grew at an annual rate of 
we believe that this supply and demand growth imbalance will continue if demand for natural gas continues to increase and production decline rates continue to accelerate 
even though the number of us gas wells drilled has increased overall in recent years  a corresponding increase in production has not been realized 
we believe that an increase in us drilling activity will be required for the natural gas industry to meet the expected increased demand for  and compensate for the slowing production of  natural gas in the united states 
trend towards drilling deeper shallow water gas wells 
a current trend by oil and gas companies is to drill deep gas wells along the us gulf coast in search of new and potentially prolific untapped natural gas reserves 
we believe that this trend towards deeper drilling will benefit premium jackup rigs as well as barge rigs and submersible rigs that are capable of drilling deep gas wells 
in addition  this trend will indirectly benefit conventional jackup fleets  such as ours  as the use of premium rigs in the us gulf coast to drill deep wells should reduce the supply of rigs available to drill shallower wells 
redeployment of jackup rigs 
greater demand for jackup rigs in international areas over the last three years has reduced the overall supply of jackups in the us gulf of mexico 
this has created a more favorable supply environment for the remaining jackups  including ours 
this favorable supply environment has contributed to increased jackup utilization and dayrates 
new building of jackup rigs 
in response to the improved market conditions  our competitors and speculators have recently begun ordering new jackup drilling rigs 
we believe there are currently jackup rigs on order with delivery dates ranging from to most of the rigs on order are premium cantilevered drilling units with to foot water depth capability 
this trend of new jackup construction could curtail a further strengthening of utilization and dayrates  or reduce them 
however  the worldwide jackup fleet is aging and will need to be replaced at some point 
currently  the average age worldwide is approximately years old 
in addition  attrition continues and was recently accelerated when the us gulf of mexico experienced two major hurricanes  which destroyed or significantly damaged nine jackup drilling rigs 
market conditions for our us gulf coast jackup fleet improved beginning in the third quarter of and continued to improve through as shown in the following table  from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of  our average revenue per day for us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles improved by 
during the same period  average revenue per day for our us inland barges improved by 
as of february   of our marketed jackup and submersible rigs working in the us gulf coast were operating at dayrates ranging from  to  as of february   of our marketed inland barges were operating at dayrates ranging from  to  we anticipate that the declining jackup rig supply in the us gulf coast due to the recent hurricane damage  the redeployment of rigs to international locations and the trend towards more deep gas well drilling will continue to result in improved utilization and higher dayrates into as a result  we are actively pursuing long term contracts with our customers to reactivate our five cold stacked us gulf of mexico jackup rigs 
additionally  we are pursuing long term contracts to reactivate some of our ten cold stacked inland barge rigs 
the following table shows our average rig revenue per day and utilization for the quarterly periods ended on or prior to december  with respect to each of our three drilling segments 
average rig revenue per day is defined as operating revenue earned per revenue earning day in the period 
utilization in the table below is defined as the total actual number of revenue earning days in the period as a percentage of the total number of calendar days in the period for all drilling rigs in our fleet  as adjusted to include calendar days available for rigs that were held for sale during the periods ended on or prior to december  three months ended december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  average rig revenue per day us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles us inland barges other international utilization us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles us inland barges other international in response to strengthening demand for drilling rigs  we began reactivating certain of our cold stacked rigs beginning in the second quarter of and continuing into we did so  however  only if we first obtained a term drilling contract for each reactivated rig at a dayrate sufficient to recover  over the full term of the contract  all of our expected operating expenses of performing the contract plus all  or a substantial portion of  our anticipated costs of reactivating the rig 
since december   we have commenced or completed the reactivation of eight drilling rigs  consisting of three jackup rigs  two submersible rigs and three barge rigs 
we estimate that the total actual and estimated remaining costs of reactivating these eight rigs will be approximately million but that we will receive million in total historical and estimated future revenues over the full term of the related drilling contracts 
for additional information concerning each of our completed and pending rig reactivations and the related term contract  please see business reactivation of rigs against term contracts 
approximately million was capitalized and million was charged to operating and maintenance expense in connection with rig reactivations in with respect to currently pending rig reactivations  we estimate that million of reactivation costs will be capitalized in  and that approximately million will be charged to operating and maintenance expense 
we expect that we may reactivate or commit to reactivate additional cold stacked rigs in  but only if we are able to obtain suitable term contracts on the reactivated rig or if we are confident that we will be able to do so in view of then favorable market conditions 
in anticipation of reactivating cold stacked rigs in  we have ordered certain rig components and equipment that have extended delivery times 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and capital resources  below 
in the third quarter of  we were awarded contracts with pemex for two of our jackup rigs and a platform rig 
after upgrades to comply with contract specifications  one rig  the  began operating on a day contract in early november at a contract dayrate of approximately  a new day contract was awarded for the at dayrates of approximately  which became effective in late october the other jackup rig  the  began operating in early december on a  day contract at a contract dayrate of approximately  the platform rig contract is  days in duration and began operating in december at a contract dayrate of approximately  each of the contracts can be terminated by pemex on five days notice  subject to certain conditions 
all of the damage caused by these two hurricanes is covered under our hull and machinery insurance policy with a total incident deductible of million  which will be exceeded in both incidents 
currently  we have recognized million of insurance claims expense through the fourth quarter of for the insurance deductibles related to the damage sustained during hurricane katrina 
we also incurred million in expenses related to damages caused by hurricane rita 
we recorded million of claims receivable for the repair amount incurred above the million insurance deductible related to losses sustained during hurricane rita 
any remaining expenses incurred related to damage caused by hurricane rita will be recorded as a claims receivable 
in january  we retained simmons company international to explore alternatives for the disposition of our venezuelan land drilling business  which is not viewed by us as being core to our ongoing offshore drilling business 
the evaluation may result in the sale of some or all of our venezuelan assets 
in october  we renewed our principal insurance coverages for property damage  liability and occupational injury and illness for a one year term 
generally  our deductible levels under the new hull and machinery policies are of individual insured asset values per occurrence except in the event of a total loss only where the deductible would be zero 
an annual limit of million and a minimum deductible of million per occurrence applies in the event of a windstorm 
previously  our deductible level under these policies was million per occurrence with no windstorm limits 
in addition  in an effort to control premium costs  we reduced our insurance coverage to of our losses in excess of the applicable deductible and we are uninsured for the remaining of any such losses 
the primary marine package also provides coverage for cargo  control of well  seepage  pollution and property in our care  custody and control 
our deductible for this coverage varies between  and million per occurrence depending upon the coverage line 
in addition to our marine package  we have separate policies providing coverage for general domestic liability  employer s liability  domestic auto liability and non owned aircraft liability with million deductibles per occurrence 
we also have an excess liability policy that extends our coverage to an aggregate of million under all of these policies 
our insurance program also includes separate policies that cover certain liabilities in foreign countries where we operate 
our premium cost increased from approximately million to approximately million under these new policies  which also included an increase of approximately million for insured values 
we believe our current insurance coverage  deductibles and the level of risk involved is adequate and reasonable 
however  insurance premiums and or deductibles could be increased or coverages may be unavailable in the future 
ipo and separation from transocean in july  transocean announced plans to divest its gulf of mexico shallow and inland water shallow water business through an initial public offering of todco common stock 
during  we completed the transfer to transocean of all assets not related to our shallow water business transocean assets  including the transfer of all revenue producing transocean assets 
accordingly  the transocean assets and related operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in our historical financial statements 
in february  we completed our initial public offering in which transocean sold  shares of our class a common stock the ipo 
after several stock offerings and a private sale in and  transocean had converted all of its unsold shares of class b common stock into an equal number of shares of class a common stock and had sold all of its remaining shares of our common stock 
as a result of the conversion  no class b common stock was outstanding as of december  and we received no proceeds from any of these sales 
prior to the ipo  we entered into several agreements with transocean defining the terms of the separation of our business from transocean s business 
these agreements included a master separation agreement which defined our separate businesses and provided for allocations of responsibilities and rights in connection therewith  a tax sharing agreement which allocated certain rights and responsibilities with respect to pre and post ipo taxes  a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we are required to file registration statements to assist transocean in selling its shares of our common stock  an employee matters agreement which governed the application of the separation of our employees from transocean and its benefit plans and a transition services agreement under which transocean provided certain services to us during the initial phases of our separation from transocean 
see notes    and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion concerning our separation from transocean 
changes in results of operations related to our separation from transocean as a result of our separation from transocean  including the transfer of the transocean assets to transocean in and the completion of our ipo in february  our reporting of certain aspects of our results of operations differs from our historical reporting of results of operations 
the following discussion describes these and other differences 
general and administrative expense includes costs related to our corporate executives  corporate accounting and reporting  engineering  health  safety and environment  information technology  marketing  operations management  legal  tax  treasury  risk management and human resource functions 
prior to june  and the transfer of the transocean assets to transocean  general and administrative expense also included an allocation from transocean for certain administrative support 
after june   general and administrative expense includes costs for services provided to us under our transition services agreement with transocean 
in addition  we are incurring additional general and administrative expense associated with the vesting of stock options and restricted stock granted in conjunction with the ipo 
in february  we adopted a long term incentive plan for certain of our employees and non employee directors in order to provide additional incentives through the grant of awards the plan 
in conjunction with the closing of the ipo  we granted restricted stock and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
additional awards were made during from the plan which has since been replaced by a new plan 
in  a new plan was adopted to continue to provide employees  non employee directors and our consultants with additional incentives and increase their personal stake in our success the plan 
based upon the price per share at date of issuance  the value of the plan and the plan awards that we will recognize as compensation expense is approximately million 
during and we recognized million and million  respectively  of compensation expense related to these awards and grants 
we will amortize the remaining million to compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards and options 
in addition to these grants under the plan and the plan  we expect to make additional grants of restricted stock  deferred performance units  deferred stock units and stock options annually 
the value of any additional awards under the plan will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
in addition  certain of our employees held options to acquire transocean ordinary shares that were granted prior to the ipo 
in accordance with the employee matters agreement  the employees holding such options were treated as terminated for the convenience of transocean on the ipo date 
as a result  these options became fully vested and were modified to remain exercisable over the original contractual life 
in connection with the modification of the options  we recognized million in additional compensation expense in the first quarter of no further compensation expense will be recognized related to the transocean options 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances and  for periods before december   on notes receivable from delta towing 
because of the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin see variable interest entity delta towing  and the resulting consolidation of delta towing in our consolidated balance sheet effective december   we expect future interest income to consist of interest earned on our cash balances 
for periods before the ipo  interest expense consisted of financing cost amortization and interest associated with our senior notes  other debt and other related party debt as described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
after the closing of the ipo  interest expense primarily included interest on the approximately million face value of our senior notes payable to third parties  commitment fees on the unused portion of our line of credit and the amortization of financing costs 
during  the face value of our senior notes payable was further reduced to approximately million 
our debt levels and  correspondingly  our interest expense were substantially lower in and compared to prior years as a result of the notes payable to transocean prior to the ipo 
in connection with the ipo  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with transocean 
the agreement provides that we must pay transocean for substantially all pre ipo tax benefits utilized or deemed to have been utilized subsequent to the closing of the ipo 
it also provides that we must pay transocean for any tax benefit resulting from the delivery by transocean of its stock to one of our active employees in connection with the exercise of an employee stock option 
in return  transocean agreed to indemnify us against substantially all pre ipo income tax liabilities 
additionally  the tax sharing agreement provides that if any person other than transocean or its subsidiaries becomes the beneficial owner of greater than of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock  we will be deemed to have utilized all of the pre ipo tax benefits  and we will be required to pay transocean an amount for the deemed utilization of these tax benefits adjusted by a specified discount factor 
this payment is required even if we are unable to utilize the pre ipo tax benefits 
under the tax sharing agreement with transocean  if the utilization of a pre ipo tax benefit defers or precludes our utilization of any post ipo tax benefit  our payment obligation with respect to the pre ipo tax benefit generally will be deferred until we actually utilize that post ipo tax benefit 
this payment deferral will not apply with respect to  and we will have to pay currently for the utilization of pre ipo tax benefits to the extent of a up to of any deferred or precluded post ipo tax benefit arising out of our payment of foreign income taxes  and b of any deferred or precluded post ipo tax benefit arising out of a carryback from a subsequent year 
therefore  we may not realize the full economic value of tax deductions  credits and other tax benefits that arise post ipo until we have utilized all of the pre ipo tax benefits  if ever 
upon consummation of the ipo  we recorded the tax sharing agreement to eliminate the valuation allowance associated with the pre ipo tax benefits and reflect the associated liability to transocean for the pre ipo tax benefits as a corresponding obligation within the deferred income tax accounts 
the net effect was a million reduction in additional paid in capital 
in addition  we recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital million for transocean s indemnification for pre ipo liabilities that existed as of the ipo date with a corresponding offset to a related party receivable from transocean 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an additional million in pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities that existed at the ipo date 
the recognition of these pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities resulted in a million reduction in additional paid in capital  million of deferred state tax benefit and a million increase in deferred tax liabilities 
in september  transocean instructed us  pursuant to a provision in the tax sharing agreement  to take a tax deduction for profits realized by our current and former employees and directors from the exercise of transocean stock options during calendar transocean also indicated that it expected us to take a similar deduction in future years to the extent there were profits realized by our current and former employees and directors during those future periods 
it is our belief that the tax sharing agreement only requires us to pay transocean for deductions related to stock option exercises by persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
transocean disagrees with our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement as it relates to this issue and believes that we must pay for all stock option exercises  irrespective of whether any employment or other service provider relationship may have terminated prior to the exercise of the employee stock option 
as such  transocean initiated dispute resolution proceedings against us 
we recorded our obligation to transocean based upon our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement 
however  due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this dispute  we established a reserve equal to the benefit derived from stock option deductions relating to persons who were not our employees on the date of the exercise 
for the tax year ending december   the deduction related to all of our current and former employees and directors was million  with only million attributable to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
additionally  we have been informed by transocean that from january  to december   our current and former employees and directors have realized million of gains from the exercise of transocean stock options with million relating to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
if transocean s interpretation of the tax sharing agreement prevails  we would recognize a tax benefit for former employee and director stock option exercises and pay transocean in cash for an amount equal to for the deduction 
while this would not increase our tax expense  it would defer utilization of pre ipo income tax benefits 
during the years ended december  and  we utilized pre ipo income tax benefits to offset our current federal income tax obligation resulting in a liability to transocean of million and million  respectively 
additionally  during the years ended december  and  we utilized pre ipo state tax benefits resulting in a liability to transocean of million and million  respectively 
we also utilized pre ipo foreign tax benefits during resulting in a liability to transocean of million at december  there was no liability due to transocean for the utilization of foreign tax benefits at december  as of december  and  we estimate our liability to transocean to be million and million  respectively  for pre ipo federal  state and foreign income tax benefits utilized 
as of december   we had approximately million of estimated pre ipo income tax benefits subject to the obligation to reimburse transocean 
if an acquisition of beneficial ownership had occurred on december   the estimated amount that we would have been required to pay transocean would have been approximately million  or of the pre ipo tax benefits at december  the estimated liabilities to transocean at december  and and the estimated amount of remaining pre ipo income tax benefits subject to the obligation to reimburse transocean at december  do not reflect the benefit of the tax deduction for stock option exercises of former employees who were not our employees on the date of the exercise and are presented within accrued income taxes related party in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we had an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  in connection with our secondary offering in september as a result  our ability to utilize certain of our tax benefits is subject to an annual limitation 
however  we believe that  in light of the amount of the annual limitation  it should not have a material effect on our ability to utilize these tax benefits for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  investments  property  equipment and other long lived assets  income taxes  workers injury claims  employment benefits and contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment represent approximately of our total assets as of december  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our rigs 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale as prescribed by the fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the application of our property and equipment accounting policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
using different estimates  assumptions and judgments  especially those involving the useful lives of our rigs and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would result in different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
for example  a prolonged downturn in the drilling industry in which utilization and dayrates were significantly reduced could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our drilling rigs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the collection of specific amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
our operating revenues are principally derived from services to us independent oil and natural gas companies and international and government controlled oil companies and our receivables are concentrated in the united states 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be required to establish additional reserves 
provision for income taxes 
our tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
our effective tax rate is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
currently payable income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the changes in the balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates  we would make revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities  and such revisions could be material

prior to the adoption of fin  we recorded our interest in the results of delta towing as equity in income loss of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations and also recognized interest income related party related to delta towing s notes payable to us 
see variable interest entity delta towing for a discussion of the effects of fin on our investment in delta towing 
years ended december  and operating revenues 
total operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to  primarily due to higher overall average rig revenue per day earned in  as compared to overall average rig revenue per day increased from  for to  for  as a consequence of the continued improvement of market conditions in the us gulf of mexico and transition zone along the us gulf coast  the revenue contribution from our platform rig which began operating in mexico in december  the commencement of operations in angola and three land rigs which began operating in venezuela in the last half of average rig utilization of for was up from in operating revenues for our us gulf of mexico segment increased million  or  in  as compared to in  we achieved higher average rig revenue per day for our jackup and submersible drilling fleet  improving from  per day to  per day 
this resulted in an additional million in operating revenues for  as compared to the same period in the increase in average rig revenue per day is the result of our success in obtaining contracts with our customers at higher dayrates in response to increased market demand 
results for also reflect higher utilization for our current rig fleet in this market  after giving effect to the transfer of the jackup drilling unit the from our other international segment in the fourth quarter of this increase in utilization resulted in million in additional rig revenues in  as compared to the same period in the transfer of the generated operating revenues of million in before it was transferred to colombia in the last quarter of operating revenues for our us inland barge segment increased million  or  in  as compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to higher average rig revenue per day achieved in  as compared to average rig revenue per day increased from  for to  for  as a result of our successful marketing efforts in negotiating higher dayrates for our fleet of inland barges during the increase in average rig revenue per day resulted in additional revenues of million for as compared to utilization of our inland barge fleet was for  as compared to for  which resulted in million additional operating revenues in as compared to operating revenues for our other international segment were million for the  or million  increase over operating revenues reported for reflects commencement of operation of our platform rig in mexico in late under a long term contract  the commencement of operations in angola in september and the commencement of operations in venezuela of three land rigs in the last half of the operation of the platform rig contributed an additional million in operating revenues during higher land rig utilization in venezuela contributed an additional million in operating revenues in compared to in addition  the commencement of operations in angola in september contributed an additional million to operating revenues 
also  the was transferred from the us gulf of mexico to colombia in the last quarter of and generated million revenue after beginning operations in december 
these favorable contributions were offset by the transfer of the from venezuela to the us gulf of mexico which generated million in operating revenues for our operating revenues for included million related to the operation of delta towing s fleet of us marine support vessels which increased from million recognized in due to increased vessel utilization in response to improved market conditions 
operating and maintenance expenses 
total operating and maintenance expenses increased million  or  in as compared to operating expenses of million for operating and maintenance expenses for our us gulf of mexico segment were million higher for as compared to the factors contributing to this increase were additional personnel costs of million relating to the higher utilizations and wage increases in  the relocation of the back to the us gulf of mexico million and increased mobilization expense million 
repair and maintenance expense resulting from the higher utilizations increased million for as compared to our insurance claims expense increased million from damages sustained during hurricanes katrina and rita and also from damage to the during a jacking incident 
our expenses were also favorably impacted by a million reduction in our reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable and a million recovery of insurance claims related to one of our jackup drilling rigs 
operating and maintenance expenses for our us inland barge segment were million for as compared to million for this million  or  increase was primarily the result of increasing personnel costs million and higher repair and maintenance expenses million  primarily on rig hull repairs and the reactivation of rig  which was cold stacked and began operations in the third quarter of mobilization expense and rental recharges increased million when comparing results from to as a result of increased activity and utilization 
insurance claims expense related to hurricane damage in of million was more than offset by a million decrease in personal injury claim expense and insurance costs when comparing to  primarily the result of an improvement in the actuarial factors used to develop our personal injury claims 
operating and maintenance expenses for our other international segment for increased million  or  as compared to this increase was due to our platform rig in mexico which began operations in december and incurred million of expenses in  an increase of million over in addition  we incurred higher expenses on our other mexico operations of million during as compared to higher land rig utilization and increasing costs in venezuela resulted in an increase of million when comparing to reactivation of the for operations in angola resulted in an additional million in expense being incurred during the commencement of operations of a land rig in trinidad in the last quarter of contributed an additional million in expenses 
the relocation of the from the us gulf of mexico segment to colombia in the last quarter of contributed an additional million in operating expenses 
these additional expenses were partially offset by the transfer of the from venezuela in the last quarter of to our us gulf of mexico operations which lowered expenses in our other international segment by million for as compared to and a million reduction in a venezuelan labor claim legal reserve due to favorable settlements 
delta towing operations incurred million in operating costs for this represented a million  or  increase over operating costs of million recognized in which was principally due to increased marine support vessel utilization and increased repairs and maintenance expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for as compared to million for general and administrative expenses for increased million as compared to  due primarily to higher payroll costs of million and an increase in delta towing and other general and administrative expenses of million 
additional audit fees  a secondary offering in may and sarbanes oxley compliance work contributed to an increase of million in our professional  legal and accounting fees 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock option and restricted stock award expense of million 
the stock option expense of million recognized in included million of stock compensation expense associated with post ipo grants of stock options and restricted stock awards 
comparable stock compensation expense for was million which also included expense related to deferred performance units and deferred stock units 
additionally in  we recognized a one time million stock compensation expense related to the modification of transocean stock options held by some of our employees 
in addition  we incurred no administrative charges under our transition services agreement with transocean in as compared to million in gain on disposal of assets  net 
during  we realized net gains on disposal of assets of million related to the sale of three out of service jackup rigs  the million  the million and the million  the sale of drill pipe and miscellaneous equipment million and the sale of five marine support vessels by delta towing million 
during  we realized gains on disposal of assets of million  primarily related to the sale of six marine support vessels by delta towing million  the settlement of an october insurance claim for one of our jackup rigs million and the sale of drill pipe and miscellaneous equipment million 
interest expense 
third party interest expense and interest expense related party decreased million in as compared to  primarily due to lower debt balances owed to third parties and transocean 
in the first quarter of  we completed the debt for equity exchange of all our remaining outstanding related party debt payable to transocean and in the second quarter of we made payments of million to retire our senior notes 
income tax expense benefit 
the income tax expense of million for reflects a effective tax rate etr and is comprised of our obligation to transocean under the tax sharing agreement for the utilization of pre ipo federal and state tax benefits and the recognition of foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions where we have a low tax basis in our assets 
the etr is higher than the federal rate of principally due to foreign tax expense  state tax expense and a tax return adjustment 
tax expense for also includes the effect of recognizing an additional million in pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities that existed at the ipo date 
the recognition of these pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities resulted in a million reduction in additional paid in capital  million of deferred state tax benefit and a million increase in deferred tax liabilities 
under the tax sharing agreement  we are unable to reduce our federal tax benefit obligation owed to transocean for the state tax benefits utilized 
for  our net loss generated a tax benefit of million  or a etr  which was lower than the federal tax rate due to a valuation allowance on the delta towing tax benefits generated during during  transocean instructed us  pursuant to a provision in the tax sharing agreement  to take a tax deduction for profits realized by current and former employees and directors who exercised transocean stock options during calendar transocean also indicated that it expected us to take a similar deduction in future years to the extent there were profits realized by our current and former employees and directors during those future periods 
it is our belief that the tax sharing agreement only requires us to pay transocean for deductions related to stock option exercises by persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
the payment obligation is generally of the tax deduction 
transocean disagrees with our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement as it relates to this issue and it believes that we must pay for all stock option exercises  irrespective of whether any employment or other service provider relationship may have terminated prior to the exercise of the employee stock option 
as such  transocean initiated dispute resolution proceedings against us 
we recorded our obligation to transocean based on our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement 
however  due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this dispute  we established a reserve equal to the benefit derived from stock option deductions relating to persons who were not our employees on the date of the exercise 
for the tax year ending december   the deduction related to all of our current and former employees and directors was million with only million attributable to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
additionally  we have been informed by transocean that from january  to december   our current and former employees and directors have realized million of gains from the exercise of transocean stock options with million relating to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
if transocean s interpretation of the tax sharing agreement prevails  we would recognize a tax benefit for former employee and director stock option exercises and pay transocean for the deduction 
while this would not increase our tax expense  it would defer utilization of pre ipo income tax benefits 
years ended december  and operating revenues 
total operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in operating revenues is primarily attributable to higher overall average rig revenue per day earned in  and the inclusion of revenues from the operation of delta towing s fleet of marine support vessels 
overall average rig revenue per day increased from  for to  for the increase in average rig revenue per day reflects the continued improvement of market conditions in the us gulf coast  as well as the addition of two of our jackup rigs which began operating offshore mexico in late and a jackup rig that recently completed its contract offshore venezuela 
average rig utilization of for is up slightly from average rig utilization in the increased utilization is principally due to a decrease in total available rig operating days in the period as a result of the removal of five jackup rigs from drilling service in the second quarter of  partially offset by the effect of lower land rig utilization in venezuela during operating revenues for our us gulf of mexico segment increased million  or  during as compared to in  we achieved higher average rig revenue per day for our jackup and submersible drilling fleet as a result of our success in obtaining contracts with our customers at higher dayrates in response to increased market demand and decreased jackup drilling rig supply in the us gulf of mexico 
average revenue per day increased to  for  up from  for  which resulted in an additional million in operating revenues for as compared to results for also reflect higher utilization for our current rig fleet in this market  after giving effect to the transfers of the jackup drilling units the  the and the to our other international segment in the fourth quarter of this increase in utilization resulted in million in additional rig revenues in as compared to the drilling units transferred to our other international segment generated revenues of million in operating revenues for our us inland barge segment increased million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to higher average rig revenue per day 
average rig revenue per day increased from for to  for  as a result of our successful marketing efforts in negotiating higher dayrates for our fleet of inland barges during the increase in average rig revenue per day resulted in additional revenues of million for as compared to this market has continued to improve in resulting in improved utilization of our inland barge fleet compared to utilization levels experienced beginning in the last half of utilization of our inland barge fleet was for  as compared to for  which resulted in a million increase in operating revenues in operating revenues for our other international segment were million for the million  or  increase over operating revenues for reflects the operation of two of our jackup rigs  the and the  which began working offshore mexico in late under long term contracts and the operation of the  which began operating under a multi well contract with conocophillips in late december the operation of these rigs in contributed an additional million in operating revenues during the favorable contribution by these jackup rigs was partially offset by lower utilization for our land rigs in venezuela and a platform rig in trinidad that completed its contract in the third quarter of the lower utilization for our land rigs in venezuela resulted in a million decrease in operating revenues for as compared to our platform rig  which was operating in trinidad until the third quarter of  generated million of operating revenues in our operating revenues for included million related to the operation of delta towing s fleet of us marine support vessels 
operating and maintenance expenses 
total operating and maintenance expenses increased million  or  in as compared to operating expenses of million for a decrease in operating expenses for our us gulf of mexico and inland barge segments was offset by higher operating expenses in our other international segment  primarily as a result of the three additional jackup rigs working in international locations in and the inclusion of million in operating expenses related to delta towing 
the decrease in operating expenses for our domestic segments for as compared to  is primarily due to the transfer of three jackup drilling rigs from the us gulf of mexico to international locations  the absence of one time charges related to a well control incident and a fire on two of our barge rigs and an insurance provision for damages sustained to the mat finger on one of our jackup rigs in operating and maintenance expenses for our us gulf of mexico segment declined million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to the transfer of three of our jackup rigs to locations in mexico and venezuela in the fourth quarter of million and an insurance provision in for damages sustained to one of our jackup rigs million 
these favorable variances in operating costs were partly offset by higher costs for maintenance of our jackup rig fleet in the us gulf of mexico million  increased labor costs million  higher reimbursable mobilization costs million  and increased personnel related charges for labor and health benefits claims million in as compared to operating and maintenance expenses for our us inland barge segment were million for as compared to million for our results for included one time charges of million and million related to a june well control incident on rig and a september fire on rig  respectively 
the further decrease in operating expenses for this segment in as compared to  was due primarily to lower operating costs related to support vessels and other equipment rentals million  lower write downs of other receivables million and lower personal injury claims million 
these favorable decreases were partly offset by million in higher maintenance costs in operating and maintenance expenses for our other international segment for increased million as compared to  primarily due to million of additional operating expenses as a result of our jackup drilling operations in mexico 
operating expenses in also included million of costs related to the operation of the offshore venezuela through the third quarter of our results for this segment in included million of additional operating costs related to our platform rig in trinidad  which completed its contract in the third quarter of our platform rig began operating under a new contract in mexico in late december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for as compared to million for the million increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the inclusion of million of stock compensation expense associated with post ipo grants of stock options and restricted stock awards  million in stock compensation expense related to the modification of transocean stock options held by some of our employees  million in general and administrative expenses for delta towing and million in higher other overhead costs  primarily related to corporate insurance policies and professional fees 
these unfavorable variances in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  were partly offset by lower administrative charges of million for under our transition services agreement with transocean  which became effective in the third quarter of see related party transactions allocation of administrative costs 
impairment loss on long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge related to our decision to decommission our three venezuelan lake barges and to salvage any remaining useable equipment 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million resulting from our decision to take five jackup rigs out of drilling service and market the rigs for alternative uses 
we do not anticipate returning these rigs to drilling service  as we believe it would be cost prohibitive to do so 
in conjunction with these decisions  and in accordance with sfas  the carrying value of these assets was adjusted to fair market value 
the fair market value of the drilling equipment on board the lake barges and the non drilling rigs was primarily based on third party valuations 
additionally in the second quarter of  we recorded a million non cash impairment resulting from our determination that assets of entities in which we had an investment did not support our recorded investment 
the impairment was determined and measured based upon the remaining book value of the assets and our assessment of the fair value at the time the decision was made 
in december  we received million in proceeds from certain assets sold by the entities  which was recorded as a reduction to the impairment charge 
the entities were liquidated in early gain on disposal of assets  net 
during  we realized gains on disposal of assets of million  primarily related to the sale of six marine support vessels by delta towing million  the settlement of an october insurance claim for one of our jackup rigs million  and sales and disposals of used drill pipe million 
net gains losses on disposal of assets were not significant in interest expense 
third party interest expense and interest expense related party decreased million in as compared to  primarily due to lower debt balances owed to third parties and transocean  partly offset by million in bank commitment fees related to our million line of credit entered into in december in  we repaid million of third party debt and  in conjunction with the transfer of the transocean assets  we retired million in related party debt payable to transocean 
additionally  prior to the closing of our ipo  we completed a debt for equity exchange of all our remaining outstanding related party debt payable to transocean 
loss on retirement of debt 
in conjunction with the retirement of debt held by transocean in  we recorded losses on retirement of related party debt in of million

other expense  net was million for  including a million loss on revaluation of our local currency in venezuela 
in january  venezuela implemented foreign exchange controls that limited our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
the exchange controls caused an artificially high value to be placed on the local currency 
as a result  we recognized a loss on revaluation of the local currency into functional us dollars during the second quarter of in  other income  net included million in foreign currency exchange gains 
income tax benefit 
the income tax benefit of million for reflects an effective tax rate etr of  as compared to million for  based on an etr of 
the increased etr is primarily the result of providing a valuation allowance on net operating losses generated in during  we recorded a valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits generated during the year

financial condition at december  and december   we had total assets of million and million  respectively 
the million increase in assets during is primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the increased dayrates and utilizations experienced throughout million  a million increase in our accounts receivable primarily due to the increased dayrates  capital expenditures of million and the recognition of an additional million in deferred income tax assets in these increases were partly offset by depreciation of million  million in net amortization of deferred preparation and mobilization cost and the sale of assets with a net book value of million

total assets by business segment were as follows for the periods indicated below december  us gulf of mexico segment us inland barge segment other international segment delta towing segment corporate and other total assets working capital at december  was million  as compared to a working capital of million at december  the increase in working capital during is primarily attributable increases in cash and accounts receivable resulting from higher dayrates and utilization rates for our drilling rigs for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources and use of cash compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in net income of million 
adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were lower in  primarily due to unfavorable variances related to an increase in deferred income taxes of million  a million decrease in stock compensation expense recognized by us in as compared to  the million loss in related to impairment of three lake barges in venezuela and the retirement of related party debt and the additional million in gains recognized from asset sales in these were partially offset by a favorable variance resulting from an increase in deferred income recognized during of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effect of distributions to transocean  resulted in a million increase in cash in  compared to a million reduction in this million favorable increase is primarily the result of the increase in net taxes payable due to current year income million and the increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities resulting from the increased levels of activity million 
these increases were partly offset by the increase in accounts receivable which had an unfavorable impact of million when reconciling net income to net cash provided by operating activities 
higher revenues  the result of increasing dayrates and utilizations  during resulted in a significantly higher receivable balance at year end when compared to year end net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the million increase in net cash provided by investing activities relates primarily to the higher proceeds recognized from asset sales during the year of million offset by the increase in capital expenditures of million

financing activities in included an increase in restricted cash of million related to performance bonds for our mexico operations and capital lease payments of million 
sources of liquidity and capital expenditures our cash flows from operations  asset sales and existing cash balances were our primary sources of liquidity for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our primary uses of cash were operating costs  the special cash dividend payment of million  capital expenditures of and debt repayments of million 
for the year ended december   our primary uses of cash were capital expenditures of million related to upgrades and replacements of equipment  the use of million for restricted cash to support our three performance bonds related to our mexico operations and the retirement of amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated cash flows to maintain liquidity 
from time to time  we may also make use of our revolving line of credit for cash liquidity 
in december  we entered into a two year million floating rate secured revolving credit facility the facility that declined to million in december the facility expired in december at which time we entered into a two year  million floating rate secured revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility is secured by most of our drilling rigs  receivables  the stock of most of its us subsidiaries and is guaranteed by some of its subsidiaries 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at our option at either the higher of a the prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin in either case of or the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the facility are of the average daily available portion and are payable quarterly 
borrowings and letters of credit issued under the facility may not exceed the lesser of million or one third of the fair market value of the drilling rigs securing the facility  as determined from time to time by a third party approved by the agent under the facility 
financial covenants include maintenance of the following a working capital ratio of current assets plus unused availability under the facility to current liabilities of at least to  a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of not more than to tangible net worth of not less than million  and in the event availability under the facility is less than million  a ratio of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures to interest expense of not less than to  for the previous four fiscal quarters 
the revolving credit facility provides  among other things  for the issuance of letters of credit that we may utilize to guarantee its performance under some drilling contracts  as well as insurance  tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions 
the facility also provides for customary fees and expense reimbursements and includes other covenants including limitations on the incurrence of debt  mergers and other fundamental changes  asset sales and dividends and events of default including a change of control that are customary for similar secured non investment grade facilities 
at december  and  we had no borrowings outstanding under either of the facilities 
in the third quarter of  we entered into an unsecured line of credit with a bank in venezuela that provides for a maximum of million venezuela bolivars million us dollars at the current exchange rate at december  in order to establish a source of local currency to meet our current obligations in venezuela bolivars 
each draw on the line of credit is denominated in venezuela bolivars and is evidenced by a day promissory note that bears interest at the then market rate as designated by the bank 
the promissory notes are pre payable at any time at our option 
however  if not repaid within days  the promissory notes may be renewed at mutually agreeable terms for an additional day period at the then designated interest rate 
there are no commitment fees payable on the unused portion of the line of credit  and the facility is reviewed annually by the bank s board of directors 
at december   we had a balance of million outstanding under this line of credit 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at december  we expect capital expenditures primarily for rig refurbishments and the purchase of capital equipment to be approximately million in  including approximately million for announced rig reactivations 
the timing and amounts we actually spend in connection with our plans to upgrade and refurbish other selected rigs is subject to our discretion and will depend on our view of market conditions and our cash flows 
we would expect capital expenditures to increase as market conditions improve 
our cold stacked rigs requiring refurbishment to be ready for service are noted in the tables in business drilling rig fleet 
from time to time we may review possible acquisitions of drilling rigs or businesses  joint ventures  mergers or other business combinations and may in the future make significant capital commitments for such purposes 
any such transactions could involve the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares or other securities or the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash 
we would likely fund the cash portion  if any  of such transactions through cash balances on hand  the incurrence of additional debt  sales of assets  shares or other securities or a combination thereof 
in addition  from time to time we may consider dispositions of drilling rigs 
our ability to fund capital expenditures would be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate in our business  we experience poor results in our operations or we fail to meet covenants under the revolving credit facility described above 
we anticipate that market conditions should provide us an opportunity to obtain in term contracts with customers for the reactivation and return to service of all five of our remaining cold stacked us gulf of mexico jackup rigs 
approximately to million in the aggregate would be required to return these rigs to service  based on our cost projections for these future reactivations 
additionally  we anticipate that we should be able to obtain in term contracts with customers to reactivate and return to service two or three of our cold stacked  or  horsepower inland barge rigs 
based upon our historical experience and previous rig reactivation assessments we believe the estimated costs to prepare these two or three inland barge rigs for service would be approximately to million per rig 
the amounts we estimate for restoring cold stacked rigs to service are based on our projections of the costs of equipment  supplies and services  which have been rising and are becoming more difficult to project 
in addition to the uncertainty of projecting costs in a time of increasing prices  our estimates of rig reactivation costs are also subject to numerous other variables including further rig deterioration over time  the availability and cost of shipyard facilities  customer specifications  and the actual extent of required repairs and maintenance and optional upgrading of the rigs 
the actual amounts we ultimately pay for returning these rigs to service could  therefore  vary substantially from our estimates 
in anticipation of reactivating some of these rigs  we have already placed orders for equipment with long lead times  including a million commitment for three top drives with an month option for ten additional top drive units and million of drill pipe for delivery in we anticipate that our available funds  together with our cash generated from operations and amounts that we may borrow  will be sufficient to fund our required capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
future cash flows and the availability of outside funding sources  however  are subject to a number of uncertainties  especially the condition of the oil and natural gas industry 
accordingly  these resources may not be available or sufficient to fund our cash requirements 
dividend policy we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock 
we generally intend to invest our future earnings  if any  to fund our growth 
subject to delaware law  any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  level of indebtedness  statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends  and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant 
our credit facility also includes limitations on our payment of dividends 
however  due to favorable market conditions  our unrestricted cash balances grew to levels that exceeded our foreseeable needs for cash held for reinvestment and unknown contingencies 
after we secured the approval of our lenders  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share  totaling million  that was paid in august this special cash dividend is not indicative of a change in our basic dividend policy nor does it guarantee that any future dividends will be paid 
in connection with the special cash dividend and as contemplated by our long term incentive plans  our executive compensation committee awarded special cash bonuses to holders of stock options under our long term incentive plans in the aggregate amount of million to compensate them for any potential loss in option value 
these bonuses were paid in the third quarter of contractual obligations as of december   our scheduled debt maturities and other contractual obligations are presented in the table below with debt obligations presented at face value for the years ended december  to to total thereafter in millions contractual obligations debt debt related party operating leases purchase obligations accrued income taxes related party other total contractual obligations at december   we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash should the obligations be called 
these obligations represent surety bonds that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts  insurance  tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions 
these obligations could be called at any time prior to their expiration dates 
the obligations that are the subject of these surety bonds are geographically concentrated in mexico  trinidad and venezuela 
for the years ended december  to to total thereafter in millions other commercial commitments surety bonds a a relates to bonds issued primarily in connection with our contracts with pemex  pdvsa and trinidad 
derivative instruments we have established policies and procedures for derivative instruments that have been approved by our board of directors 
these policies and procedures provide for the prior approval of derivative instruments by our chief financial officer and periodic review by the audit committee of our board of directors 
from time to time  we may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not plan to enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes  however  for accounting purposes  certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative instruments that qualify as accounting hedges are deferred as accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized when the underlying foreign exchange exposure is realized 
gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized currently based on the change in market value of the derivative instruments 
at december   we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange derivative instruments 
from time to time  we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on future income 
interest rate swaps would be designated as a hedge of underlying future interest payments and would not be used for speculative purposes 
the interest rate differential to be received or paid under the swaps is recognized over the lives of the swaps as an adjustment to interest expense 
if an interest rate swap is terminated  the gain or loss is amortized over the life of the underlying debt 
at december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps

as a result of the consolidation of delta towing in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fin beginning december   the purchase of the additional interest in delta towing is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

we owned  as of december   a equity interest in delta towing  which was formed to own and operate our us marine support vessel business consisting primarily of shallow water tugs  crewboats and utility barges 
we contributed this business to delta towing in return for a ownership interest and secured notes issued by delta towing with a face value of million

in january  delta towing defaulted on the notes by failing to make its scheduled quarterly interest payments and remains in default as a result of its failure to make its quarterly interest payments 
the default continued in and when delta towing failed to make a scheduled principal repayment due in january as a result of our continued evaluation of the collectibility of the notes  we recorded a million impairment of the notes in june based on delta towing s discounted cash flows over the terms of the notes  which deteriorated in the second quarter of as a result of the continued decline in delta towing s business outlook 
in the third quarter of  we established a million reserve for interest income earned during the quarter on the notes receivable 
in january  the fasb issued fin which requires that an enterprise consolidate a variable interest entity vie if the enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity  if such loss or residual return occurs 
if one enterprise absorbs a majority of a vie s expected losses and another enterprise receives a majority of that entity s expected residual returns  the enterprise absorbing a majority of the expected losses is required to consolidate the vie and will be deemed the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes 
under fin  delta towing is considered a vie because its equity is not sufficient to absorb the joint venture s expected future losses 
todco is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of delta towing for accounting purposes because we have the largest percentage of investment at risk through the secured notes held by us and would thereby absorb the majority of the expected losses of delta towing 
we consolidated delta towing as of december  as of december   the consolidation of delta towing resulted in an increase in our net assets and a corresponding gain of million which was presented as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations

immediately following this exchange  we exchanged million and million principal amount of our outstanding and exchanged notes  respectively  held by transocean  plus accrued interest thereon  for  shares of our class b common stock  shares of class b common stock after giving effect to the stock dividend 
the determination of the number of shares issued in the exchange transactions was based on a method that took into account the ipo price of per share 
the net effect of these transactions was to decrease notes payable related party and interest payable related party by million with an offsetting increase in common stock of million and additional paid in capital of million 
there were no exchanged notes payable to transocean outstanding at december  we recognized million in interest expense related party associated with these notes prior to their cancellation in february in connection with the exchange offer  we made an aggregate of million in consent payments to holders of our notes that were exchanged 
the consent payments were amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective exchanged notes using the interest method and such amortization totaled million for the year ended december  in connection with the retirement of the exchanged notes prior to the completion of the ipo  we expensed the remaining balance of these deferred consent fees of approximately million in february  which has been reflected as a loss on retirement of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  asset transfers to transocean we transferred certain assets to transocean primarily as in kind dividends and transfers in exchange for the cancellation of debt to transocean and  in some instances  for cash 
specified contracts were assigned to transocean for no consideration 
these transactions had no effect on our results of continuing operations except to the extent that debt was retired and any gain or loss was recognized 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
other transactions between us and transocean in september  transocean instructed us  pursuant to a provision in the tax sharing agreement  to take a tax deduction for profits realized by our current and former employees and directors from the exercise of transocean stock options during calendar transocean also indicated that it expected us to take a similar deduction in future years to the extent there were profits realized by our current and former employees and directors during those future periods 
it is our belief that the tax sharing agreement only requires us to pay transocean for deductions related to stock option exercises by persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
transocean disagreed with our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement as it relates to this issue and it believes that we must pay for all stock option exercises  irrespective of whether any employment or other service provider relationship may have terminated prior to the exercise of the employee stock option 
as such  transocean initiated dispute resolution proceedings against us 
we recorded our obligation to transocean based upon our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement 
however  due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this dispute  we established a reserve equal to the benefit derived from stock option deductions relating to persons who were not our employees on the date of the exercise 
for the tax year ending december   the deduction related to all of our current and former employees and directors was million with only million attributable to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
additionally  we have been informed by transocean that from january  to december   our current and former employees and directors have realized million of gains from the exercise of transocean stock options with million relating to persons who were our employees on the date of exercise 
if transocean s interpretation of the tax sharing agreement prevails  we would recognize a tax benefit for former employee and director stock option exercises and pay transocean for the deduction 
while this would not increase our tax expense  it would defer utilization of pre ipo income tax benefits 
in february  we recorded an equity transaction related to net liabilities related to transocean s business of million for which legal title had not been transferred to transocean as of the ipo date in accordance with the master separation agreement between us and transocean 
the indemnification by transocean was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital with a corresponding offset to a related party receivable from transocean 
as part of the tax sharing agreement  we must pay transocean for substantially all pre closing income tax benefits utilized or deemed to have been utilized subsequent to the closing of the ipo 
accordingly  we recorded an equity transaction in to eliminate the valuation allowance associated with the pre closing tax benefits and reflect the associated liability to transocean for the pre closing tax benefits as a corresponding obligation within the deferred income tax asset accounts 
the net effect was a million reduction in additional paid in capital 
in  we recorded an additional million in pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities that existed at the ipo date 
the recognition of these pre ipo deferred state tax liabilities resulted in a million reduction in additional paid in capital  million of deferred state tax benefit and a million increase in deferred tax liabilities 
in addition  transocean agreed to indemnify us for certain tax liabilities that existed as of the ipo date which are currently estimated to be million 
we recorded the tax indemnification by transocean as a credit to additional paid in capital with a corresponding offset to a related party receivable from transocean

foreign exchange risk our international operations in angola  colombia  mexico  trinidad and venezuela expose us to foreign exchange risk 
we use a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
our primary foreign exchange risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
we may also use foreign exchange derivative instruments or spot purchases 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
in january  venezuela implemented foreign exchange controls that limited our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
prior to august  our drilling contracts in venezuela typically called for payments to be made in local currency  even when the dayrate is denominated in us dollars 
in august  we negotiated an agreement with our principal customer in venezuela to pay the majority of the us dollar denominated amounts in us dollars to one of our banks in the united states 
the exchange controls could also result in an artificially high value being placed on the local currency 
in the second quarter of  we established a currency valuation allowance of million pertaining to cash and receivables in venezuela in order to adjust our venezuelan financial assets to net realizable value as of june  this valuation allowance was necessary due to the continuing political instability in venezuela and the continuation of foreign exchange controls  which limited our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
in march and september  we reversed million and million  respectively  of the currency valuation allowance that was no longer deemed necessary due to a sustained decrease in the net carrying value of assets denominated in the local currency  primarily as a result of an agreement with our primary customer in venezuela to pay the majority of the us dollar denominated accounts receivable in us dollars to one of our banks in the united states 
as a result of the march reversal  we no longer have a currency valuation allowance 
on march   venezuela increased the official exchange rate from  bolivars us dollar to  bolivars us dollar 
we do not anticipate that this change in exchange rate will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows
