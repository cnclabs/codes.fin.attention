item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the information in the item a 
risk factors section of this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market a range of products serving the aesthetic medicine market  including plastic and reconstructive surgery 
our products include surgically implantable prosthesis for plastic and reconstructive surgery  as well as capital equipment and consumables used for soft tissue aspiration for body contouring liposuction 
historically  we operated in three reportable segments aesthetic and general surgery  surgical urology  and clinical and consumer healthcare 
our surgical and urology products included surgically implantable prostheses for the treatment of impotence  surgically implantable incontinence products  urinary care products and brachytherapy seeds for the treatment of prostate cancer 
our clinical and consumer healthcare products included catheters and other products for the management or urinary incontinence and retention 
in october  we began to evaluate strategic alternatives for our surgical urology and clinical and consumer healthcare businesses 
on may   we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell our urology business to coloplast a s for total consideration of million million in cash and the remainder consisting of the value of certain foreign tax credits that we expect to realize arising from the transaction prior to the close 
on june   the sale of the urology business was completed 
on june   our porges sas subsidiary sold certain intellectual property to coloplast for million  which is included in the total consideration of million 
the purchase price is subject to a post closing adjustment based on the working capital of the acquired business as of the closing date  and a downward reduction in an amount equal to of the amount of certain transfer taxes and related fees incurred in connection with the transaction  of the cost of severance obligations in respect of certain former employees of the urology business who will not continue with the urology business following the closing of the transaction  and certain other administrative costs 
the purchase agreement with coloplast contains customary representations and warranties and indemnification provisions whereby each party agrees to indemnify the other for breaches of representations and warranties  breaches of covenants and other matters  with our liability for breaches of representations and warranties generally limited to of the purchase price 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  an escrow fund was established with million withheld from the purchase price to secure our indemnification obligations with respect to any breaches of our representations and warranties for a period of months 
in addition  the purchase agreement provides that we will not enter into or engage in a business that competes with the urology business  on a worldwide basis  for a period of seven years following the closing of the transaction 
these restrictions on competition do not apply to i the development  manufacture or sale of any oral pharmaceuticals or any product or treatments involving dermal fillers or other bulking agents or toxins  including botulinum toxins  or ii any business acquired and operated by us or our affiliates for so long as any such businesses generate less than million in aggregate annual revenues from any competing business 
these restrictions on competition terminate upon a change in control of mentor 
in connection with the sale to coloplast  we also entered into a transition services agreement and various supply agreements 
pursuant to the transition services agreement  in exchange for specified fees  we will provide to coloplast and coloplast will provide to us  services including accounting  information technology  customer support and use of facilities 
under the supply agreements we will supply various products  including silicone gel filled testicular implants to coloplast and coloplast will supply us with components for the manufacture of our breast implants 
these services agreements are expected to extend through a period not to exceed twelve months and the supply agreements range from a period of months 
these services and supply agreements are not expected to have a significant impact on our future cash flows from continuing operations 
on june   we also completed the sale of our intellectual property  raw materials and tangible assets for the production of silicone male external catheters relating to our catheter production facility in anoka  minnesota and our inventory of such catheters to rochester medical corporation  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
as a result of the sale to coloplast  the assets and liabilities related to the urology business have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  operations associated with the urology business have been classified as income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
prior to being designated as discontinued operations  the urology business contributed approximately of our consolidated net sales and approximately of our operating profit in fiscal year we will record a net gain on the sale of our urology business in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of this sale  we will be able to focus on the aesthetic medicine market 
we intend to leverage our traditional strengths in plastic surgery and grow our market presence in cosmetic dermatology 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of discounts  returns  and rebates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
as required by these standards  revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met  and sales and related cost of sales are recognized  upon the shipment of products  or in the case of consignment inventories  upon the notification of usage by the customer 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and other volume based incentives 
should the actual level of customer participation in these programs differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale based on historical experience  recent gross sales levels and any notification of pending returns 
should the actual returns differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
our deferred revenue consists of both current and long term and includes funds received in connection with sales of our enhanced advantage breast implant limited warranty program 
the fees received in connection with a sale of an enhanced advantage breast implant limited warranty are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the life of the warranty term 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  canada  western europe  central and south america  and the pacific rim 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers  primarily hospitals  doctors and distributors 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers  or the economy as whole  were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances for estimated losses would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost  based on the first in first out fifo cost method  or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
these additional valuation adjustments would be included in cost of sales 
warranty reserves we offer two types of warranties relating to our breast implants in the united states  canada  and puerto rico a standard limited warranty which is offered at no additional charge and an enhanced limited warranty at an additional charge of in the us cad in canada  which provide limited financial assistance in the event of a deflation or rupture 
our standard limited warranty is also offered in certain european and other international countries for silicone gel filled breast implants 
we provide an accrual for the estimated cost of breast implant warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
costs related to warranties are recorded in cost of sales 
the estimated cost of the standard limited warranty is recorded as an expense at the time of sale  whereas the estimated cost of the enhanced limited warranty is deferred and recognized over the term of the enhanced limited warranty which approximates costs as incurred 
such accruals are based on estimates  which are based on relevant factors such as unit sales  historical experience  the limited warranty period  estimated costs  and  to a limited extent  information developed by our insurance company using actuarial techniques 
these accruals are analyzed periodically for adequacy 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by reported rates of warranty claims and levels of financial assistance specified in the limited warranties 
should actual patient claim rates reported differ from our estimates  adjustments to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these adjustments would be included in cost of sales 
product liability reserves we have product liability reserves for product related claims to the extent those claims may result in litigation expenses  settlements or judgments within our self insured retention limits 
we have also established additional reserves  through our wholly owned captive insurance company  for estimated liabilities for product related claims based on actuarially determined estimated liabilities  taking also into account our excess insurance coverages 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
product liability costs are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses as they are directly under the control of our general counsel and other general and administrative staff and are directly impacted by our overall corporate risk management strategy 
should actual product liability experience differ from the estimates and assumptions used to develop these reserves  subsequent changes in reserves will be recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  and may affect our operating results in future periods 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  we evaluate goodwill and other intangibles annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  and analyzed goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
impairment tests were performed at adoption  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and  and no impairment was noted as a result of these analyses 
the impairment tests performed in fiscal indicated certain impaired assets  for which we recorded impairment charges in fiscal these impairment charges are included in the results of operations 
see note i intangible assets and goodwill of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense for fiscal and thereafter effective april  we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in fiscal and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in fiscal and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share in note g of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative research and development severance charges restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges operating income interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income years ended march  and sales net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of breast implant products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the majority of the increase in breast implant product sales is attributable to organic growth in unit sales of our breast implants and associated products 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the euro  had a minimal year to year impact on international net sales 
increased net sales were driven by growth in the reconstruction markets both domestically and internationally 
we saw overall growth in unit sales of breast implant products of approximately 
although we try to avoid competing on price  we continued to see competitive price pressure in both the domestic and international markets for breast implants 
net sales of body contouring products decreased to million from million in the prior year 
liposuction continues to be the leading surgical cosmetic procedure in the united states  however  we have seen some recent softness in sales growth in our body contouring business 
we have seen some variability in capital equipment purchasing patterns  specifically in our ultrasonically assisted product line  and we are in the process of defining our strategy to improve growth in this business 
other aesthetic products net sales increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenue from our facial aesthetics products  including puragen  which was launched in a variety of international markets in may we expect our net sales to increase to approximately million in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal remained relatively unchanged at of net sales  compared to in fiscal cost of sales had some variations in quarterly results primarily due to timing of the building of silicone gel breast implant inventory in anticipation of potential fda approval 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of legal and professional fees related to an unsolicited offer to acquire medicis inc  which did not materialize 
we did not incur any similar fees during fiscal also contributing to the increased expenses was i an increase of approximately million in costs associated with our global facial aesthetics selling and marketing efforts in support of our hyaluronic acid based dermal filler product  puragen  ii an increase of approximately million in costs associated with the expansion of our domestic sales force  iii higher levels of expenses at our foreign sales subsidiaries of approximately  iv an increase of approximately million related to increased sales and marketing efforts focusing on our international markets  v an increase of approximately million in compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock grants  and vi an increase of approximately million in our patient and physician education programs 
to a lesser extent  increased personnel costs in support of sales and marketing contributed to the year over year increase 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in performance related compensation of approximately million and the completion of our direct to consumer television advertising program related to our breast implant products  resulting in decreased expenses of approximately million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to significantly increase in fiscal as a result of our adoption of sfas r effective april  however  the amount of the increase cannot be predicted because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted in fiscal and the then current fair values 
in addition  during fiscal we anticipate that we will incur various severance and other restructuring related charges associated with our transition to a company focused on aesthetic medicine  which we also expect to result in higher selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year 
research and development research and development spending primarily supports our key strategic product development programs 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending was primarily to support key strategic product development programs  including our silicone gel filled breast implant regulatory submissions in the united states and canada  our botulinum toxin project  us clinical studies for our hyaluronic acid based dermal filler product  puragen  and the continued development of automated manufacturing technologies 
we continue to be committed to a variety of clinical studies and laboratory tests in connection with our silicone gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 
severance charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  two individuals resigned as directors and executive officers of the company 
in connection with their resignation and severance agreements  we incurred million in expenses  comprised of million in cash expense and million in non cash expense 
restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred million in expenses related to restructuring of certain of our operations to achieve improved efficiencies and certain long lived assets that were determined to be impaired 
the restructuring charges totaled million and the impairment charges totaled million 
interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal these costs included interest on our million convertible subordinated notes at issued in december  interest expense on balances outstanding under our foreign lines of credit  commitment fees on our credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs 
the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher commitment fees and was partially offset by lower borrowings on our international facilities 
interest income increased million to million compared to million in fiscal  as a result of generally higher rates of interest and higher balances of cash and cash equivalents available for investment 
other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales of marketable securities and foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations 
other income decreased to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of the increase in the euro s relative strength compared to the us dollar 
income taxes our effective rate of corporate income taxes was in fiscal year  a decrease of of pretax income from the rate in fiscal year this decrease is a result of greater tax benefits associated with our foreign operations  lower state taxes and increased research and development credits 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we repatriated million in foreign profits  and estimated the tax liability on the repatriation was approximately million 
net income from continuing operations and earnings per share net income from continuing operations in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal earnings per share from continuing operations increased to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to for the fiscal year compared to for fiscal as a result of additional net income  partially offset by a increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earning per share 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  represents the results of our former surgical urology and clinical and consumer healthcare business segments  which were sold to coloplast on june   as discussed above 
during fiscal  income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase is the result of an increase in net sales of million  a decrease in cost of sales of million  and a decrease in research and development expense of million  partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense and a million increase in income tax expense 
the increase in net sales was less than historic rates of growth due to the disruption as a result of the aforementioned sale process in the second half of the fiscal year  the negative impact of foreign exchange movements of million  and the decrease of million due to a planned reduction of oem contract revenue from million to million 
cost of sales decreased due to an improved manufacturing process  changes to a more profitable product mix following decreased oem sales  and product rationalization 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreased restructuring and long term asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year  and a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements of million 
income tax expense related to discontinued operations increased due to an additional provision related to open audit issues 
for further details regarding discontinued operations  see note t of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended march  and sales during fiscal  net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of breast implant products increased to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in breast implant product sales was attributable to organic growth in unit sales of our breast implants and associated products and approximately million was the result of a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
increased net sales were driven by growth in the augmentation and reconstruction markets both domestically and internationally 
we saw overall growth in domestic unit sales of breast implant products of approximately 
we continued to see competitive price pressure in both the domestic and international markets for breast implants 
net sales of body contouring products increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of our capital equipment  associated disposable products  and higher average selling prices were the leading contributors to our body contouring sales growth 
other aesthetic products net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenue from physician participation in our extreme mentor direct to consumer television advertising program which began in september cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal was of net sales  compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to favorable pricing on raw materials and overall improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas and netherlands facilities in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal we had generally higher levels of expenses at our foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries of approximately  of which approximately million reflected the effect of foreign currency rate movements  primarily the stronger euro 
also contributing to the increase was approximately million in incentive compensation expenses associated with achieving specific operating targets  our direct to consumer television advertising program  which was launched in september  of approximately million  and higher legal related expenses of approximately million due to increased litigation expenses and other legal and corporate matters 
in addition  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and increased support of sales and marketing contributed to the year over year increase 
research and development research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal the majority of the increase was attributable to increased support for our silicone gel filled breast implant regulatory submissions in the united states and canada  increased patient volume in our adjunct study  new clinical studies and laboratory testing for our hyaluronic acid based dermal filler product  puragen  and our botulinum toxin project 
severance charges on february   christopher j 
conway and adel michael each resigned as a director and executive officer of the company 
in connection with resignation and severance agreements entered into with them  we incurred a total of million in expenses in february as one of the co founders of our company  and following years of service  mr 
conway received certain severance compensation in the form of cash payments totaling million and non cash benefits in the amount of million related to the accelerated vesting of his unvested and unexpired stock options 
in addition  mr 
adel michael  our former vice chairman  received severance compensation in the form of cash benefits in the amount of million and non cash benefits in the amount of million related to the accelerated vesting of his unvested and unexpired employee stock options 
there were no similar charges in fiscal restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred million in expenses related to restructuring of certain of our operations to achieve improved efficiencies and certain long lived assets that were determined to be impaired 
the restructuring charges totaled million and the impairment charges totaled million 
there were no similar charges in fiscal interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the fiscal expense related to the coupon and issuance cost amortization for our million convertible subordinated notes issued in december the increase in interest expense was attributable to a full year of interest and amortization of issuance costs on these notes in fiscal in fiscal  interest expense included only four months of accrued interest payable and amortization of bond issue costs 
the remaining interest expense in fiscal  was interest on balances outstanding under our foreign lines of credit  which benefited from lower rates of interest and lower levels of borrowings in fiscal interest income increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher prevailing interest rates on short term investments  and slightly longer maturities  partially offset by lower levels of cash balances available for investment 
other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of the less favorable impact of the euro s relative strength compared to the us dollar  and a decrease in realized and unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio of marketable securities 
these decreases were partially offset by a one time gain in fiscal of approximately million relating to insurance proceeds received to cover lost sales margin on finished goods inventory that was damaged 
income taxes our effective rate of corporate income taxes remained relatively flat at in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year net income from continuing operations and earnings per share net income from continuing operations in fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal earnings per share from continuing operations was per share in fiscal and per share in fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to for the fiscal year compared to a restated for fiscal as required by eitf  we have retroactively restated diluted earnings per share figures for fiscal for the impact of our convertible subordinated notes issued in december the effect of share repurchases was offset by the dilutive effect to earnings per share following the adoption of eitf which required the inclusion  for calculation purposes  of additional shares that are contingently issuable 
net income from continuing operations in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal increased net sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal were offset by higher operating expenses  including severance  restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges  as well as higher interest expense resulting in net income from continuing operations being less than in fiscal income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  represents the results of our former surgical urology and clinical and consumer healthcare business segments  which were sold to coloplast on june   as discussed above 
during fiscal  income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of an increase in net sales of million  partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense and a million increase in income taxes 
the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate variations contributed approximately million to the increase in sales while the remainder of the increase was due to continued market acceptance of our new products and or line extensions  and an increase in unit sales for commodity type items 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges of million which were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes related to discontinued operations increased due to an increase in state and foreign taxes and decrease in r d credits 
for further details regarding discontinued operations  see note t of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition and results of operation for the reporting periods presented in this report 
we cannot be certain that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
as of april   sfas no 
r requires us to account for our stock options using a fair value based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements 
the majority of this compensation expense will be captured in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sfas r will also require the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
prior to april   we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  which generally results in no employee stock option expense 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities and from the exercise of employee stock options has been our primary recurring source of funds 
we recently completed the sale of our urology business to coloplast for total consideration of million  which is subject to customary post closing adjustments and includes non cash consideration consisting of the value of certain foreign tax credits that mentor expects to realize arising from the transaction prior to the close 
on the closing date of june   we received million in cash from coloplast  and an additional million is held under an escrow agreement in connection with the transaction 
after expenses  we expect net after tax proceeds from the sale to be approximately million 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from continuing operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure  and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the loss of future cash flows from our discontinued surgical urology and clinical and consumer healthcare segments will not have a significant negative impact on our future finance levels  terms of financing or covenants 
cash flows have been segregated between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  an increase of million or  compared to million as of march  the principal components of the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations of million  cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations of million  proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  net borrowings under line of credit agreements of million for continuing operations  offset by million in dividends paid  million for shares repurchased  million used for net capital expenditures of continuing operations  million used for net capital expenditures of discontinued operations  and million for repayment of debt on our foreign lines of credit for discontinued operations 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and which have varying maturities 
our short term marketable securities consist primarily of state and municipal government and government agency obligations  federal home loan bank and mortgage association bonds  and investment grade corporate obligations  including commercial paper 
as of march  in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities percentage of total assets cash flow changes the following table summarizes our cash flow activity year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations net cash provided by used by discontinued operations effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of million  and million for the years ended march   and  respectively  was greater than net income in those years  due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
non cash adjustments include tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and loss on the disposal of assets 
for the years ended march   and  operating cash flows were positively impacted in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  by changes in working capital balances 
our working capital was million at march   and million at march  cash used for investing activities of continuing operations cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was primarily attributable to purchases and sales of marketable debt and equity securities  as well as capital expenditures on property and equipment and intangibles 
for the year ended march   total cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million 
our net purchases of marketable securities totaled million and our capital expenditures totaled million 
we anticipate our capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal  as we will continue to invest in facility improvements  software to support our manufacturing processes  and production equipment 
for the year ended march   total cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million 
this amount was comprised of net investments of million in marketable securities  million in capital expenditures and million in other investment activities 
cash provided by discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this amount in was comprised of million provided by operating activities of discontinued operations  less capital expenditures of million  million repaid on lines of credit  million in loans made and million in currency exchange rate adjustments 
in  the amount was comprised of million provided by operating activities of discontinued operations and million in currency exchange rate adjustments  less capital expenditures of million and million repaid on lines of credit 
cash used for financing activities of continuing operations net cash from financing activities is primarily a result of cash provided by employee stock option exercises  cash used in payments of dividends and our stock repurchase program  and the net impact of our debt financing activities 
we have a stock repurchase program  primarily to offset the dilutive effect of our employee equity compensation program  to provide liquidity to the market  and to reduce the overall number of shares outstanding 
all shares repurchased under the program are retired and are no longer deemed to be outstanding 
during the quarter ended march  our board of directors authorized an additional million shares for repurchase under our repurchase program 
as part of that repurchase program  a total of approximately  shares were repurchased from two directors who retired during the quarter 
these shares were purchased on march  for approximately million at per share  a discount from the market closing price quotation from the nyse of on that date 
during the quarter ended december   million shares were repurchased for million 
the december repurchase included the repurchase of million shares from two investment partnerships managed by va partners  llc  which was at the time  our largest shareholder 
on june   we agreed to repurchase million additional shares from an investment partnership managed by valueact capital at per share  a discount from the closing market price quoted on the nyse of on that date 
the million shares were repurchased for a total of million pursuant to the company s continuing stock repurchase program 
mr 
jeff ubben  managing director of valueact capital  is a member of our board of directors 
the repurchase of these shares was pre approved by the audit committee and the board of directors with interested parties abstaining or not in attendance 
at june   approximately million shares remained authorized for repurchase 
the timing of our repurchases is subject to market conditions  cash availability  and blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing shares

in addition to our rabobank facility  we previously established several lines of credit with local foreign lenders to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign urology subsidiaries

the total amount of additional borrowings available to us under all lines of credit was million and million at march  and  respectively 
the increase in the amounts available from the prior year is primarily due to the addition of our new million senior credit facility in may convertible subordinated notes on december   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due january   pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes bear interest at per annum and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share and are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt

both the bond hedge and the warrants transactions may be settled at our option either in cash or net shares and expire january  the convertible bond hedge and warrants transactions combined are intended to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes by effectively increasing the conversion price per share  from our perspective  to approximately

contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other commitments at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
certain of the obligations shown below were assumed by coloplast  the buyer of our urology business and thus are not contractual obligations for us subsequent to the close of the sale on june  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years convertible notes operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest on debt lines of credit credit agreement commitment fees acquisition and other milestones other long term liabilities total on june   in connection with the sale of our urology business  our operating lease agreements relating to the urology business were assigned to coloplast 
as a result  our future payments due under our outstanding lease agreements decreased by a total of million million due in less than one year  million due in one to three years  million due in four to five years  and million due in more than five years 
on june   also in connection with the sale of our urology business  our purchase obligations relating to the urology business were assigned to coloplast

the nature of our business creates a need to enter into purchase obligations with suppliers 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory related and other purchase obligations do not exceed our projected requirements over the normal course of business 
we enter into various product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations 
in connection with some of these activities  we agree to make payments to third parties when specific milestones are achieved  such as receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that funds generated from operations  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net after tax proceeds from our sale of the urology business received subsequent to year end  plus funds available under our line of credit agreements will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure investment requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance unforeseen requirements or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies through the sale of equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds in the short term  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow for other reasons 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risks involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not use derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
we also have current marketable securities  consisting primarily of tax exempt variable demand notes  government agency obligations  federal home loan bank and mortgage association bonds with maturities on or before march   and investment grade corporate obligations  including commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the relative short term nature of these investments  we do not expect to experience any material impact upon our results of operation as a result of changes to interest rates related to these investments 
on december   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due january  pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
our subsidiaries also maintain certain levels of variable rate debt such as operating lines of credit 
the majority of our debt carries a fixed rate percentage and therefore is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition related to the variable rate debt described exchange rate risk a portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign markets 
we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and europe and sell them throughout the world through a combination of wholly owned sales offices and international distributors 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are transacted in us dollars  euros  british pounds  and canadian dollars 
our foreign sales offices primarily invoice customers in their local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets mentioned 
the principal risk exposure we face results from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates 
we experience transactional exchange rate risk when one of our subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
in the last two fiscal years  the effect of exchange rate risk has been favorable upon our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently hedge any of the foreign exchange rate exposures 
a significant and rapid change in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations
