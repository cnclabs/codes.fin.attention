item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statements of cash flows discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview piedmont natural gas company is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers in portions of north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
we also have equity method investments in joint venture  energy related businesses 
our operations are comprised of two business segments 
the regulated utility segment is the largest segment of our business with approximately of our consolidated assets 
this segment is regulated by three state regulatory commissions that approve rates and tariffs that are designed to give us the opportunity to generate revenues to cover our gas and non gas costs and to earn a fair rate of return for our shareholders 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include a safe  reliable natural gas distribution system and the ability to recover the costs and expenses of the business in rates charged to customers 
the non utility activities segment consists of our equity method investments in joint venture  energy related businesses that are involved in unregulated retail natural gas marketing  interstate natural gas storage and intrastate natural gas transportation 
we invest in joint ventures that are aligned with our business strategies to complement or supplement income from utility operations 
we continually monitor performance of these ventures against expectations 
weather conditions directly influence the volumes of natural gas delivered by the regulated utility 
significant portions of our revenues are generated during the winter season 
during warm winters or unevenly cold winters  heating customers may significantly reduce their consumption of natural gas 
although we have weather normalization adjustment wna mechanisms that are designed to protect a portion of our revenues against warmer than normal weather  deviations from normal weather can affect our financial performance and liquidity 
the wna also serves to offset the impact of colder than normal weather by reducing the amounts we can charge our customers 
in a general rate case proceeding during  the north carolina utilities commission ncuc ordered the establishment of a customer utilization tracker cut and the elimination of the wna  effective november  the north carolina office of the attorney general has filed a notice of appeal in this rate proceeding challenging the lawfulness of the ncuc s authorization and approval of the cut 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
over the past few years  there have been significant increases in the wholesale cost of natural gas 
the relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on wholesale gas prices 
the natural gas production  processing and pipeline infrastructure in the gulf of mexico was significantly affected by hurricanes in august and september after the hurricanes  this production was shut in at various levels for extended periods due to lack of power  damage to facilities and lack of gas flow 
some of the production remains closed or is operating at reduced capacity 
as a result of this disruption in supply and other supply and demand factors  wholesale gas prices are expected to remain high and significantly increase customers bills during the heating season 
we believe we have sufficient supplies of natural gas under contract to meet the needs of our firm customers  however  price increases could shift our customers preference away from natural gas toward other energy sources  particularly in the industrial market 
price increases could also affect the consumption levels of our customers or make it more difficult for them to pay their bills 
we expect that the wholesale price of natural gas will remain high and volatile until natural gas supply and demand are in better balance 
on august   president bush signed into law the energy policy act of  the first major energy legislation passed by congress in years 
we believe this legislation is the first step towards addressing our nation s energy issues  but it falls short 
we believe the legislation does not adequately stimulate domestic natural gas supply development and additional measures are necessary to provide access to supplies in areas such as the outer continental shelf  the rocky mountains and alaska 
it is too early to identify the impact of this legislation on us 
although we have been operating in a relatively low interest rate environment for both short and long term debt financing during the past few years  the federal funds rate has steadily increased and is the highest it has been in over four years 
we anticipate that interest rates will continue to rise  which could result in an increase in rates on our borrowings 
part of our strategic plan is to manage our gas distribution business through sound rate and regulatory initiatives  control of our operating costs and implementation of new technologies 
we are working to enhance the value and growth of our utility assets by good management of capital spending  both for improvements for current customers and the pursuit of customer growth opportunities in our service areas 
we strive for quality customer service by investing in systems  processes and people 
we will continue to work with our state regulators to maintain fair rates of return and balance the interests of our customers and shareholders 
our strategic plan includes a focus on maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio within a range of to 
we will continue to stress the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings to support our operating and investment needs 
we continually monitor our level of short term borrowings and secure short term bank lines that meet our short term operating needs

million from secondary market activity 
secondary market transactions consist of off system sales and capacity release arrangements 
million from changes in delivery mix  including the impacts of sales revenues versus transportation revenues and sales and transportation to power generation customers 
million from the wna due to charges of million in compared with charges of million in as discussed in financial condition and liquidity below  we had  through october   a wna in all three states designed to offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on residential and commercial customer billings and margin

million from increased customer rates and charges  including changes in rate design  in tennessee  effective november  excluding ncng  volumes decreased million dekatherms in primarily due to warmer weather 
this decrease resulted in a decrease in operating revenues of million 
in general rate proceedings  state regulatory commissions authorize us to recover a margin  applicable rate less cost of gas  on each unit of gas delivered 
the commissions also authorize us to recover margin losses resulting from negotiating lower rates to industrial customers when necessary to remain competitive 
the ability to recover such negotiated margin reductions is subject to continuing regulatory approvals

the gain on sale of equity method investments of million in resulted from the sale of our propane interests effective january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the gain on sale of marketable securities of million in resulted from the sale in february of common units of energy transfer partners  lp  which we received in connection with the sale of our propane interests in the equity portion of the allowance for funds used during construction afudc was zero in  
million in and million in afudc is allocated between equity and debt based on actual amounts computed and the ratio of construction work in progress to average short term borrowings 
non operating income is comprised of merchandising  service work  the non equity method portion of the activities of our subsidiaries  interest income and other miscellaneous income 
non operating income in includes a pre tax gain on the sale of the corporate office land of million 
changes in all other non operating income were not significant

million increase in interest on short term debt due to higher balances outstanding at higher interest rates  largely due to purchases of gas at higher prices 
million increase in interest on long term debt due to higher balances outstanding  including amounts due to the permanent financing of the ncng and easternnc acquisitions 
utility interest charges increased million in compared with primarily due to the following changes million increase in interest on long term debt due to higher balances outstanding  including amounts due to the permanent financing of the ncng and easternnc acquisitions 

million increase for interest in connection with the internal revenue service audit of our federal income tax return for million decrease in net interest expense on amounts due to from customers due to higher net receivables in compared with significantly higher net payables in our business piedmont natural gas company  inc  which began operations in  is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to  residential  commercial and industrial customers in portions of north carolina  south carolina and tennessee  including  customers served by municipalities who are our wholesale customers 
we are invested in joint venture  energy related businesses  including unregulated retail natural gas marketing  interstate natural gas storage and intrastate natural gas transportation 
in  our predecessor  which was incorporated in under the same name  was merged into a newly formed north carolina corporation for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation to north carolina 
effective at the close of business on september   we purchased of the common stock of ncng from progress energy  inc progress  for million in cash plus million for estimated working capital 
we paid an additional 
million for actual working capital in the second quarter ended april  at the time of the acquisition  ncng  a regulated natural gas distribution company  served  customers in eastern north carolina  including  customers served by four municipalities who were wholesale customers of ncng 
ncng was merged into piedmont immediately following the closing 
on september   we also purchased for million in cash progress equity interest in easternnc 
at that time  easternnc was a regulated utility with a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the ncuc to provide natural gas service to counties in eastern north carolina that previously were not served with natural gas 
progress equity interest in easternnc consisted of of easternnc s outstanding common stock and of easternnc s outstanding preferred stock 
effective at the close of business on october   we purchased for the remaining interest in common stock of easternnc from albemarle pamlico economic development corporation 
easternnc was merged into piedmont immediately following the closing 
for further information on this transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we continually assess the nature of our business and explore alternatives to traditional utility regulation 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services provide additional challenges and opportunities for us 
we also regularly evaluate opportunities for obtaining natural gas supplies from different production regions and supply sources to maximize our natural gas portfolio flexibility and reliability 
for further information  see gas supply and regulatory proceedings below and note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have two reportable business segments  regulated utility and non utility activities 
for further information on business segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our utility operations are regulated by the ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina pscsc and the tennessee regulatory authority tra as to rates  service area  adequacy of service  safety standards  extensions and abandonment of facilities  accounting and depreciation 
we are also regulated by the ncuc as to the issuance of securities 
we are also subject to or affected by various federal regulations 
these federal regulations include regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry  such as regulations of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that affect the availability of and the prices paid for the interstate transportation of natural gas  regulations of the department of transportation that affect the construction  operation  maintenance  integrity and safety of natural gas distribution systems and regulations of the environmental protection agency relating to the use and release into the environment of hazardous wastes 
in addition  we are subject to numerous regulations  such as those relating to employment practices  which are generally applicable to companies doing business in the united states of america 
in the carolinas  our service area is comprised of numerous cities  towns and communities including anderson  greenville and spartanburg in south carolina and charlotte  salisbury  greensboro  winston salem  high point  burlington  hickory  spruce pine  reidsville  fayetteville  new bern  wilmington  tarboro  elizabeth city  rockingham and goldsboro in north carolina 
in north carolina  we also provide wholesale natural gas service to greenville  monroe  rocky mount and wilson 
in tennessee  our service area is the metropolitan area of nashville  including wholesale natural gas service to gallatin and smyrna 
we invest in joint ventures to complement or supplement income from utility operations 
if an opportunity aligns with our overall business strategies  we analyze and evaluate the project with a major factor being a projected rate of return greater than the returns allowed in our utility operations  due to the higher risk of such projects 
we participate in the governance of the venture by having a management representative on the governing board of the venture 
we monitor actual performance against expectations 
decisions regarding existing joint ventures are based on many factors  including performance results and continued alignment with our business strategies 
financial condition and liquidity we believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for working capital  construction expenditures  anticipated debt redemptions and dividend payments 
these resources include net cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets  cash generated from our investments in joint ventures and bank lines of credit 
cash flows from operating activities 
the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature 
operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to such factors as weather  natural gas prices  collections from customers  natural gas purchases and gas inventory storage activity 
we rely on operating cash flows and short term bank borrowings to meet seasonal working capital needs 
during our first and second quarters  we generally have positive cash flows from the sale of flowing gas and gas in storage and the collection of accounts billed to customers 
we use this cash to reduce short term debt to zero during much of the second and third quarters 
we realize most of our annual earnings in the winter period  which is the first five months of our fiscal year 
cash requirements generally increase during the third and fourth quarters due to increases in natural gas purchases for storage and decreases in receipts from customers 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash flows from operations are impacted by weather which affects gas purchases and sales 
warmer weather can lead to lower total margin from fewer volumes of natural gas sold or transported 
colder weather can increase volumes sold to weather sensitive customers  but may lead to conservation by customers in order to reduce their consumption 
temperatures above normal can lead to reduced operating cash flows  thereby increasing the need for short term borrowings to meet current cash requirements 
our regulatory commissions approve rates that are designed to give us the opportunity to generate revenues  assuming normal weather  to cover our gas costs and fixed and variable non gas costs and to earn a fair return for our shareholders 
we have had a wna in place in all three states that partially offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on bills rendered in november through march for weather sensitive customers 
the wna generated charges to customers of million in and million in and credits to customers of million in in north carolina and tennessee  adjustments are made directly to the customer s bill 
in south carolina  the adjustments are calculated at the individual customer level and recorded in a deferred account for subsequent collection from or refund to all customers in the class 
the wna formula calculates the actual weather variance from normal  using years of history  which results in an increase in revenues when weather is warmer than normal and a decrease in revenues when weather is colder than normal 
the gas cost portion of our costs is recoverable through purchased gas adjustment pga procedures and is not affected by the wna 
the financial condition of the natural gas marketers and pipelines that supply and deliver natural gas to our distribution system can increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we believe our risk exposure to the financial condition of the marketers and pipelines is minimal based on our receipt of the products and services prior to payment and the availability of other marketers of natural gas to meet our firm supply needs if necessary 
in anticipation of higher gas prices for the winter heating season  we have worked with our regulators to design mechanisms to assist residential customers who experience difficulty in paying their winter bills by expanding the availability of alternative billing arrangements 
we have held educational forums in each of our jurisdictions  and have communicated via radio and newspaper  to educate customers on winter gas prices and available payment plans and to encourage conservation efforts 
in addition  we have established a web site  naturalgasanswers 
com  to help customers learn how to reduce the cost of heating their homes 
we have also asked our representatives in congress to approve additional funds for low income home energy assistance program funds  and have encouraged our customers to do so also 
the regulated utility competes with other energy products  such as electricity and propane  in the residential and commercial customer markets 
the most significant product competition is with electricity for space heating  water heating and cooking 
increases in the price of natural gas can negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer 
this can impact our cash needs if customer growth slows  resulting in reduced capital expenditures  or if customers conserve  resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 
in the industrial market  many of our customers are capable of burning a fuel other than natural gas  fuel oil being the most significant competing energy alternative 
our ability to maintain industrial market share is largely dependent on price 
the relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas 
with a tighter balance between domestic supply and demand  the cost of natural gas from non domestic sources may play a greater role in establishing the future market price of natural gas 
the price of oil depends upon a number of factors beyond our control  including the relationship between supply and demand and the policies of foreign and domestic governments 
our liquidity could be impacted  either positively or negatively  as a result of alternate fuel decisions made by industrial customers 
with significantly higher wholesale gas costs due in part to the recent hurricanes  we anticipate that there may be more fuel switching by large industrial customers in the near term 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for utility construction expenditures  and in  the purchases of ncng and easternnc 
gross utility construction expenditures were million million net of afudc  contributions in aid of construction and bond reimbursements for easternnc s expenditures 
as expenditures are made in easternnc s service territory  reimbursement requests are made to the state of north carolina under orders issued by the ncuc granting easternnc a total of million of bond funds 
such funds are available to pay for the uneconomic portion of the construction of the natural gas distribution infrastructure in the eastern part of the state 
for further information about the bond fund  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have a substantial capital expansion program for construction of distribution facilities  purchase of equipment and other general improvements 
this program primarily supports the growth in our customer base 
net utility construction expenditures in were million  compared with million in and million in gross utility construction expenditures totaling million  primarily to serve customer growth  are budgeted for  however  we are not contractually obligated to expend capital until the work is completed 
due to projected growth in our service areas  significant utility construction expenditures are expected to continue and are a part of our long range forecasts that are prepared at least annually and typically cover a forecast period of five years 
on may   we sold our corporate office building located in charlotte  north carolina for million in cash  net of expenses 
in accordance with utility plant accounting  we recorded the disposition of the land as a pre tax gain of million in other income expense in the consolidated statement of income and a loss of million on the disposition of the building as a charge to accumulated depreciation in the consolidated balance sheet  based on the sales price allocation from an independent third party 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  we leased back the building from the new owner until our new office space was ready for occupancy 
we negotiated a ten year lease with renewable options in a building that we relocated to in november the lease payments for the ten year term range from million to million annually 
we received million in cash in from the sale of marketable securities which we received in connection with the sale of our propane interests in we received million in cash in from the sale of equity method investments  million from our investment in us propane  lp  and million from our investment in greenbrier pipeline company  llc 
in  we acquired of the common stock of ncng and a equity interest in easternnc from progress 
in  we acquired the remaining equity interest in easternnc 
these acquisitions were a part of our focus on growing our core utility business 
for further information regarding the acquisitions  see note e and note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in funds were primarily provided from bank borrowings and  in and  the issuance of common stock through dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans 
financing activities in and also reflect the temporary and permanent financing of the acquisitions of ncng and easternnc 
when required  we sell common stock and long term debt to cover cash requirements when market and other conditions favor such long term financing 
as of october   our current assets were million and our current liabilities were million  primarily due to seasonal requirements as discussed above 
under committed bank lines of credit totaling million  for which we pay a maximum annual fee of 
million  outstanding short term borrowings during ranged from zero to million  and interest rates ranged from to 
as of october   we had additional uncommitted lines of credit totaling million on a no fee and as needed  if available  basis 
as of january   we have increased the amount of uncommitted lines to million 
as of october   we had a line of credit for letters of credit of million  of which million were issued and outstanding 
these letters of credit are used to guarantee claims from self insurance under our general liability policies 
the level of short term borrowings can vary significantly due to changes in the wholesale prices of natural gas and to the level of purchases of natural gas supplies to serve customer demand and for storage 
short term debt may increase when wholesale prices for natural gas increase because we must pay suppliers for the gas before we collect our costs from customers through their monthly bills 
gas prices could continue to increase and fluctuate 
if wholesale gas prices remain high  we may incur more short term debt to pay for natural gas supplies and other operating costs since collections from customers could be slower and some customers may not be able to pay their gas bills on a timely basis 
during  we issued million of common stock through dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
under the common stock open market purchase program discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during we paid million for million shares of common stock that are available for reissuance to these plans 
we increased our common stock dividend on an annualized basis by 
per share in and 
per share in and dividends of million  million and million for  and  respectively  were paid on common stock 
the amount of cash dividends that may be paid on common stock is restricted by provisions contained in certain note agreements under which long term debt was issued  however  as of october   none of our retained earnings were restricted 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  we expect to make the scheduled payment of million on the senior notes 
we expect to issue long term debt in depending upon our needs for long term financing and current market conditions 
as of october   our capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  consisted of in long term debt and in common equity 
our long term targeted capitalization ratio is in long term debt and in common equity 
as of october   all of our long term debt was unsecured 
our long term debt is rated a by standard poor s ratings services and a by moody s investors 
credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short term and long term financing and the cost of such financings 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider various factors 
the more significant quantitative factors include ratio of total debt to total capitalization  including balance sheet leverage  ratio of net cash flows to capital expenditures  funds from operations interest coverage  ratio of funds from operations to average total debt  and pre tax interest coverage 
qualitative factors include  among other things stability of regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate  risks and controls inherent in the distribution of natural gas  predictability of cash flows  business strategy and management  corporate governance guidelines and practices  industry position  and contingencies 
we are subject to default provisions related to our long term debt and short term bank lines of credit 
the default provisions of our senior notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  interest coverage of times  total debt cannot exceed of total capitalization  funded debt of all subsidiaries in the aggregate cannot exceed of total company capitalization  failure to make payments on any capitalized lease obligation  bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency  and final judgment against us in excess of million that after days is not discharged  satisfied or stayed pending appeal 
the default provisions of our medium term notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  failure after the receipt of a day notice to observe or perform for any covenant or agreement in the notes or in the indenture under which the notes were issued  and bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency 
failure to satisfy any of the default provisions would result in total outstanding issues of debt becoming due 
there are cross default provisions in all our debt agreements 
as of october   we are in compliance with all default provisions 
as of october   our estimated future contractual obligations were as follows 
payments due by period less than after in thousands year years years years total long term debt interest on long term debt pipeline and storage capacity gas supply telecommunications and information technology defined benefit pension plan funding postretirement benefits plan funding operating leases other purchase obligations total see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recoverable through purchased gas adjustment pga procedures 
reservation fees that are recoverable through pga procedures 
consists primarily of maintenance fees for hardware and software applications  usage fees  local and long distance data costs  frame relay  cell phone and pager usage fees and contract labor and consulting fees 
estimated funding beyond three years is not available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consists primarily of pipeline products  vehicles  contractors and merchandise 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases that are reflected in the table above and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other relevant factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions and make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current information if we determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are warranted 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or a different estimate that could have been used would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we consider regulatory accounting  revenue recognition  goodwill and pension and postretirement benefits to be our critical accounting estimates 
management has discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates presented below with the audit committee of the board of directors 
regulatory accounting 
our regulated utility segment is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
our accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement  and are in accordance with accounting requirements and ratemaking practices prescribed by the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows us to defer expenses and revenues in the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when those expenses and revenues will be allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
we then recognize these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
if we  for any reason  cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of our operations  we would eliminate from the balance sheet the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria and include them in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such an event could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period this action was recorded 
regulatory assets as of october  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
regulatory liabilities as of october  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
the detail of these regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
utility sales and transportation revenues are based on rates approved by state regulatory commissions 
base rates charged to customers may not be changed without formal approval by the regulatory commission in that jurisdiction  however  the wholesale cost of gas component of rates may be adjusted periodically under pga procedures 
through october   a wna factor  based on the margin or base rate component of the billing rate  is included in rates charged to residential and commercial customers during the winter period of november through march in all jurisdictions except easternnc 
the wna is designed to offset the impact that unusually cold or warm weather has on customer billings during the winter season 
without the wna  our operating revenues in would have been lower by million 
revenues are recognized monthly on the accrual basis  which includes estimated amounts for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method from the last meter reading date to month end 
meters are read throughout the month based on an approximate day usage cycle  therefore  at any point in time  volumes are delivered to customers that have not been metered and billed 
the unbilled revenue estimate reflects factors requiring judgment related to estimated usage by customer class  changes in weather during the period and the impact of the wna 
secondary market  or wholesale  sales revenues are recognized when the physical sales are delivered based on contract or market prices 
goodwill 
all of our goodwill is attributable to the regulated utility segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a weighted average of the guideline company method of the market approach and the discounted cash flow method of the income approach on the premise of continued use  which assumes that a buyer and seller contemplate the continued use of the reporting unit at its present location as part of current and future operations 
the guideline company method of the market approach is based on market multiples of companies that are representative of our peers in the natural gas distribution industry 
the discounted cash flow method of the income approach consists of estimating annual future cash flows and individually discounting them back to the present value 
these calculations are dependent on several subjective factors  including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
the calculations also define the reporting unit as the domestic natural gas distribution business 
an impairment charge would be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded its fair value 
using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions and continued cash flows 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of capital would have the following effects 
in thousands basis point increase basis point decrease change in fair value of the regulated utility segment the basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would not have required the recording of an impairment charge 
pension and postretirement benefits 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of eligible full time employees 
we also provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible full time employees 
our reported costs of providing these benefits  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are impacted by numerous factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics and various actuarial calculations  assumptions and accounting mechanisms 
because of the complexity of these calculations  the long term nature of these obligations and the importance of the assumptions used  our estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations  projected health care cost trend rates  expected long term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases  within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate projected benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods 
the discount rate in was determined for each plan by projecting the plan s cash flows and developing a zero coupon spot rate yield curve using non arbitrage pricing and moody s aa or better rated non callable bonds 
based on this approach  the weighted average discount rate for the pension plans changed from in to in and in similarly  based on this approach  the weighted average discount rate for postretirement benefits changed from in to in and in based on our review of actual cost trend rates and projected future trends in establishing health care cost trend rates  we changed our health care cost trend rate from in to in and in  declining gradually to in in determining our expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we review past long term performance  asset allocations and long term inflation assumptions 
we target our asset allocations for pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit assets to be approximately equity securities and fixed income securities 
the expected long term rate of return of plan assets was in  and  and will be maintained at in based on a fairly stagnant inflation trend  our age related assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels was in and  but increased to in due to a change in the demographics of the participants 
the following reflects the sensitivity of pension cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions  assuming that the other components of the calculation are constant 
in thousands change in impact on impact on projected actuarial assumption assumption pension cost benefit obligation increase decrease discount rate rate of return on plan assets 
n a rate of increase in compensation the following reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions  assuming that the other components of the calculation are constant 
impact on impact on accumulated in thousands change in postretirement postretirement actuarial assumption assumption benefit cost benefit obligation increase decrease health care cost trend rate rate of return on plan assets 
n a discount rate we utilize a number of accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs 
differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets 
if necessary  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees 
gas supply and regulatory proceedings we continue to pursue the diversification of our supply portfolio through pipeline capacity arrangements that access new sources of supply and market area storage and that diversify supply concentration away from the gulf coast region 
we have a firm transportation contract pending with midwestern gas transmission company for  dekatherms per day of additional pipeline capacity that will provide access to canadian and rocky mountain gas supplies via the chicago hub  primarily to serve our tennessee markets 
the anticipated in service date is november we have also executed an agreement with hardy storage company for market area storage capacity with an anticipated in service date in we have a equity interest in this project which is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
secondary market transactions permit us to market gas supplies and transportation services by contract with wholesale or off system customers 
these sales contribute smaller per unit wholesale margins to earnings  however  the program allows us to act as a wholesale marketer of natural gas and transportation capacity in order to generate operating margin from sources not restricted by the capacity of our retail distribution system 
in north carolina and south carolina  a sharing mechanism is in effect where of any margin earned is refunded to customers 
secondary market transactions in tennessee are included in the performance incentive plan discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
rate proceedings in north carolina and south carolina were completed during that will impact earnings 
proceedings in both states adopted new approaches to ratemaking design 
for further information about these regulatory proceedings and other regulatory information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity method investments for information about our equity method investments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we have developed an environmental self assessment plan to assess our facilities and program areas for compliance with federal  state and local environmental regulations and to correct any deficiencies identified 
as a member of the north carolina mgp initiative group  we  along with other responsible parties  work directly with the north carolina department of environment and natural resources to set priorities for manufactured gas plant mgp site remediation

accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment statement r 
statement r requires entities to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based plans 
the fair value method requires the amortization of the fair value of stock based compensation as determined at the date of grant over the related vesting period 
under statement r  most employee stock purchase plans that offer a discount of greater than are considered compensatory 
we will adopt statement r on november   and amend our employee stock purchase plan to lower the discount from to 
the adoption of statement r will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  to clarify the term conditional asset retirement as used in sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin requires that a liability be recognized for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred  if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  accordingly  we will adopt fin no later than our fourth fiscal quarter in we are currently assessing the impact fin may have on our consolidated balance sheet  however  we believe the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
forward looking statements documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec may contain forward looking statements 
in addition  our senior management and other authorized spokespersons may make forward looking statements in print or orally to analysts  investors  the media and others 
forward looking statements concern  among others  plans  objectives  proposed capital expenditures and future events or performance 
these statements reflect our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include regulatory issues  including those that affect allowed rates of return  terms and conditions of service  rate structures and financings 
we monitor our effectiveness in achieving the allowed rates of return and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed 
in addition  we purchase natural gas transportation and storage services from interstate and intrastate pipeline companies whose rates and services are regulated 
residential  commercial and industrial growth in our service areas 
the ability to grow our customer base and the pace of that growth are impacted by general business and economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in the capital markets and the overall strength of the economy in our service areas and the country  and fluctuations in the wholesale prices of natural gas and competitive energy sources 
deregulation  regulatory restructuring and competition in the energy industry 
we face competition from electric companies and energy marketing and trading companies and we expect this highly competitive environment to continue 
the potential loss of large volume industrial customers to alternate fuels or to bypass  or the shift by such customers to special competitive contracts at lower per unit margins 
regulatory issues  customer growth  deregulation  economic and capital market conditions  the cost and availability of natural gas and weather conditions can impact our ability to meet internal performance goals 
the capital intensive nature of our business 
in order to maintain growth  we must add to our natural gas distribution system each year 
the cost of this construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining governmental approvals  compliance with federal and state pipeline safety and integrity regulations  development project delays and changes in project costs 
weather  general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost of a project 
our internally generated cash flows are not adequate to finance the full cost of this construction 
as a result  we rely on access to both short term and long term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
changes in the availability and cost of natural gas 
to meet firm customer requirements  we must acquire sufficient gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to our distribution system while also ensuring that our supply and capacity contracts allow us to remain competitive 
natural gas is an unregulated commodity market subject to supply and demand and price volatility 
producers  marketers and pipelines are subject to operating and financial risks associated with exploring  drilling  producing  gathering  marketing and transporting natural gas and have risks that increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
impact of the energy policy act of key components of the bill include provisions that encourage fuel diversity in the generation of electricity  provide incentives promoting energy efficiency and innovative technology  allow an inventory of energy reserves in the outer continental shelf and support liquified natural gas lng imports and improved leasing and permitting processes in the development of existing supply fields 
the effect of this legislation on our future operations is unknown 
changes in weather conditions 
weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a material impact on our earnings 
severe weather conditions  including destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes  can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system 
weather conditions directly influence the supply of  demand for and the cost of natural gas 
changes in environmental  safety and system integrity regulations and the cost of compliance 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations 
compliance with such regulations may result in increased capital or operating costs 
ability to retain and attract professional and technical employees 
to provide quality service to our customers and meet regulatory requirements  we are dependent on our ability to recruit  train  motivate and retain qualified employees 
changes in accounting regulations and practices 
we are subject to accounting regulations and practices issued periodically by accounting standard setting bodies 
new accounting standards may be issued that could change the way we record revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
future changes in accounting standards could affect our reported earnings or increase our liabilities 
earnings from our equity method investments 
we invest in companies that have risks that are inherent in their businesses and we assume such risks as an equity investor 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe the assumptions underlying our forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that these statements will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
when used in our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  seek  intend  plan  estimate  expect  objective  projection  budget  forecast  goal or similar words or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may are intended to identify forward looking statements 
factors relating to regulation and management also may be described or incorporated by reference in future filings with the sec 
some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ have been described above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold all financial instruments discussed below for purposes other than trading 
we are potentially exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the cost of gas 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to short term debt 
we are exposed to interest rate changes to long term debt when we are in the market to issue long term debt 
as of october   all of our long term debt was at fixed rates 
exposure to gas cost variations relates to the wholesale supply  demand and price of natural gas 
interest rate risk we have short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds 
the level of borrowings under such arrangements varies from period to period depending upon many factors  including our investments in capital projects 
future short term interest expense and payments will be impacted by both short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
as of october   we had million of short term debt outstanding under committed bank lines of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 
the carrying amount of our short term debt approximates fair value 
during  such short term debt outstanding ranged from zero to million  with interest rates from to 
information as of october   about our long term debt that  for holders of our long term debt  is sensitive to changes in interest rates is presented below 
expected maturity date fair value as there of october in millions after total fixed rate long term debt average interest rate commodity price risk in the normal course of business  we utilize exchange traded contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of a portion of our natural gas requirements 
we also manage our gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers 
due to cost based rate regulation in our utility operations  we have limited financial exposure to changes in commodity prices as substantially all changes in purchased gas costs and the costs of hedging our gas supplies are passed on to customers through pga mechanisms 
materials risk our supply of plastic pipe was affected by the august and september hurricanes in the gulf coast region as the pipe is a petroleum product 
one of our suppliers evoked force majeure and placed all of its customers on an allocation program 
our allocation was increased in november and december and is expected to be at a normal level by early we have avoided any stock outages by relocating inventory within our service areas and by receiving additional allotments from vendors 
additional information concerning market risk is set forth in financial condition and liquidity in item of this form k
