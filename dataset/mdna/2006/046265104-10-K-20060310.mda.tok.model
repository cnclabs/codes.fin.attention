item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with our md a in its entirety 
as a premier long island community bank  our goal is to enhance shareholder value while building a solid banking franchise 
we focus on growing our core businesses of mortgage lending and retail banking while maintaining superior asset quality and controlling operating expenses 
additionally  we continue to provide returns to shareholders through increased dividends and our stock repurchases 
we have been successful in achieving this goal over the past several years and that trend has continued during during the year ended december   the national and local real estate markets remained strong and continued to support new and existing home sales 
the fomc raised the federal funds rate eight times during as a result  us treasury yields at december  have increased from december   with the exception of the thirty year us treasury yield  which has decreased 
although us treasury yields have risen  yields on the longer end of the us treasury yield curve have not risen to the same degree as shorter term yields 
this has resulted in a significant flattening of the us treasury yield curve  which began in the latter half of and continued during in addition  changes in medium and long term yields within individual quarters have resulted in variability in cash flows and refinance activity during as a result of the us treasury yield curve environment that prevailed during  we pursued a strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through a reduction in the securities and borrowings portfolios through normal cash flow  while emphasizing deposit and loan growth 
our total loan portfolio increased during the year ended december  this increase was a result of the increase in our mortgage loan portfolio due to the overall reduction in repayment activity in as compared to  coupled with continued strong loan origination volume 
total deposits increased during the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our certificates of deposit and our new liquid cds as a result of the continued success of our marketing campaigns which have focused on attracting these types of deposits 
growth in our certificates of deposit and liquid cds contributes to the management of interest rate risk  enables us to reduce our borrowing levels and continues to produce new customers from our communities  creating relationship development opportunities 
our securities and borrowings portfolios decreased from december   which is consistent with our strategy of reducing these portfolios through normal cash flow in response to the continued flattening of the us treasury yield curve 
during the third quarter of we entered into a sub servicing agreement with dmi to outsource our mortgage loan servicing activities 
pursuant to this sub servicing agreement  effective december   dmi has undertaken the servicing of our mortgage loan portfolio  including our portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for other investors 
the decision to take this action was driven by economics as we continue to strive to increase operating efficiency in all aspects of our operations 
while our individual mortgage loan balances are currently larger than in prior years  the number of loans we service has decreased over the past several years  thereby lowering operating efficiency 
in addition  we implemented other company wide cost saving initiatives in an effort to improve future operating efficiency 
our results of operations for year ended december  include million  before tax  in charges related to the outsourcing of our mortgage loan servicing activities and other company wide cost saving initiatives 
these initiatives  which resulted in staff reductions primarily in our mortgage servicing  retail banking and loan origination areas  are expected to result in annual net expense savings of approximately million  before tax  beginning in net income for increased from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increases in net interest income and non interest income 
the increase in net interest income is attributable to an increase in interest income  partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  coupled with a decrease in net premium amortization on our mortgage backed securities and mortgage loan portfolios 
the decrease in net premium amortization was primarily due to the reduction in repayment levels during  as well as the reduced amount of unamortized premium remaining in our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in interest expense on certificates of deposit and liquid cds as a result of the increases in the average balances of these deposits  partially offset by the decrease in interest expense on borrowings primarily resulting from the decrease in the average balance of borrowings 
the increase in non interest income relates primarily to the other than temporary impairment write down on our fhlmc perpetual preferred securities in the fourth quarter  coupled with an increase in customer service fees  partially offset by the absence of gains on sales of securities in we expect the operating environment to remain challenging throughout as rising short term interest rates and relatively stable medium and long term interest rates exert further pressure on the net interest margin 
as a result  we expect to continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through a reduction in the securities and borrowings portfolios through normal cash flow  while we emphasize deposit and loan growth  all of which should continue to improve both the quality of the balance sheet and earnings 
overall  these activities should result in a further reduction in the balance sheet similar to the reduction 
additionally  we anticipate that the net interest margin will be somewhat lower in as compared to  but should not decline below an average of for the full year 
as we continue to reduce the size of the balance sheet during this challenging interest rate environment  we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital
