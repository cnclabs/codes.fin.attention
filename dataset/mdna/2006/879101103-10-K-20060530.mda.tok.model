item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
restatement of previously issued financial statements as discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and the unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the quarters in the nine months ended september  and for each of the quarters in the year ended december  specifically  we have restated our consolidated financial statements as the result of certain errors that existed in our previously issued financial statements  principally related to our application of sop and to our accounting  presentation and disclosure of certain financial statement items such as i customer service costs  ii deferred income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and iii certain miscellaneous accrued expenses and prior period purchase accounting entries 
all referenced amounts in this report for years ended december  and and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis 
executive summary the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial statements  including a brief discussion of our business and products  key factors that impacted our performance  and a summary of our operating results 
this executive summary should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this item  risk factors in item a and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
overview of our business and products we are a developer of switching and signaling telecommunications products and services  network performance management technology  business intelligence and value added applications 
our products and services are widely deployed in traditional and next generation wireline and wireless networks and contact centers worldwide 
we are principally engaged in the design  development  manufacture  marketing  sales and 
table of contents support of our telecommunications products and services 
our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of telecommunications equipment and software  the related professional services  such as installation and training services  and the related customer support  including customer extended warranty service contracts 
payment terms for contracts with our customers are negotiated with each customer and are based on a variety of factors  including the customer s credit standing and our history with the customer 
our corporate headquarters are located in morrisville  north carolina with research and development facilities and sales offices throughout the world 
we generate revenues from our products and services in four geographic regions north america  europe  the middle east and africa  the caribbean and latin america  and asia and the pacific region  including china 
we are organized into four major operating groups the network signaling group  the switching solutions group  the communications software solutions group  and the iex contact center group 
network signaling group 
our network signaling group products help direct and control voice and data communications 
they enable carriers to establish  control and terminate calls 
they also enable carriers to offer intelligent services  which include any services other than the call or data transmission itself 
examples of such services include products such as voice messaging  toll free calls eg  calls  prepaid calling cards  text messaging and local number portability ie  the ability to take a phone number to another carrier 
switching solutions group 
the switching portion of a network carries and routes the actual voice or data comprising a call 
our switching solutions group is focused primarily on creating and enhancing next generation voice switching products and services for both traditional circuit based applications and newer packet based applications 
in a traditional circuit based application  electronic signals carrying a voice message traverse the network following a dedicated path  or circuit  from one user to the other 
packet based switching  however  breaks down the voice message into packets 
these packets then individually traverse the network  often taking separate paths  and are then reassembled on the other side of the network prior to delivery to the recipient 
packet based switching may utilize one of many protocols  the most common of which are asynchronous transfer mode or atm and internet protocol or ip 
voice transported using the ip protocol is often referred to as voice over ip or voip 
we offer switching products and services that allow network service providers to migrate their network infrastructure from circuit based technology to packet based technology 
in addition  we offer a suite of professional services that includes network design and capacity planning  as well as installation and cutover services 
communications software solutions group 
our communications software solutions group is focused on providing network related intelligence products and services to telecommunications operators 
these products and services enable operators to monitor their service and network performance by accessing and analyzing critical business data such as call volumes  subscriber behavior and traffic types and volumes 
as part of our communications software portfolio  we offer call management  revenue assurance  monitoring  network optimization  quality of service and marketing intelligence applications 
in addition  as more network providers transition from circuit to packet technology  we offer products and services that enable operators to monitor their service and network performance during the transition  helping to speed up the implementation of packet networks  while lowering their risks associated with the transition 
iex contact center group 
our iex contact center group provides workforce management and intelligent call routing systems for single and multiple site contact centers 
we sell our products primarily to customers in industries with significant contact center operations such as financial services  telecommunications and retail 
in april  we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of our iex contact center group as discussed under proposed disposition of iex contact center business unit below 
internal control and corporate governance as discussed further in item a of this annual report  we found three material weaknesses  as defined in the professional accounting literature  within our internal control structure that existed as of december  these material weaknesses  either directly or indirectly  primarily relate to or result from our not having 
table of contents had as of that date sufficient personnel with the requisite knowledge of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
as discussed further in item a  we believe the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the resulting transition to a new finance and accounting team have significantly improved our internal control and that the addition of new financial staff have resulted either directly or indirectly in the remediation of two of the three material weaknesses as of december  further  we have made significant additional progress in towards remediating the remaining material weakness 
notwithstanding the material weakness as of december  discussed above  we consider our internal control over financial reporting a high priority 
we continually review all aspects and make improvements in our internal control 
our executive management is committed to ensuring that our internal control over financial reporting is complete  effective and appropriately documented 
in the course of our evaluation of our internal control  we sought to identify data errors or control problems and to confirm that the appropriate corrective actions  including process improvements  were being undertaken 
we also sought to deal with any control matters in this evaluation  and in each case if a problem was identified  we considered what revision  improvement or correction to make in accordance with our ongoing procedures 
our continued objective is to maintain our internal control as a set of dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
in addition to striving to maintain an effective system of internal control relating to financial reporting  we follow high professional standards in measuring and reporting our financial performance 
specifically  we have adopted a code of conduct for all of our employees and directors that requires a high level of professionalism and ethical behavior 
we believe that our accounting policies are prudent and provide a clear view of our financial performance 
we utilize our internal audit function to help ensure that we follow these accounting policies and maintain our internal control 
further  our disclosure committee  composed primarily of senior financial and legal personnel  helps ensure the completeness and accuracy of the reporting of our financial results and our other disclosures 
prior to the release of our financial results  key members of our management review our operating results and key accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee  which is composed solely of independent members of our board of directors 
operating environment and key factors impacting our results currently  virtually all networks that carry both voice and data communications are primarily based on traditional circuit switching technology while newer data only networks rely predominantly on packet switching technology 
networks using packet switching technology are inherently more efficient and cost effective than circuit based networks resulting in a per transmission minute cost savings of up to by analyst s estimates 
we believe the telecommunications industry is in the early stages of a multi year migration to an ip multimedia subsystem ims core network architecture 
ims is a packet based core network architecture that will provide operators with increased flexibility and efficiencies 
fixed and mobile voice service providers are currently experiencing a commoditization of their voice services  which has resulted from increased competition 
the deployment of ims offers fixed and mobile service providers an opportunity to offset declining revenues from their traditional voice services by offering consumers expanded multimedia services such as video  chat and online gaming 
we also expect that ims may facilitate fixed mobile convergence  or fmc 
fmc is the integration of wireline and wireless networks and services to provide the end user a seamless communications service experience for voice and data 
our products and services provide our customers with what we believe to be key components to successfully migrate to ims 
we believe the migration to ims by our customers will be gradual  reflecting their desire to determine how best to leverage their existing network infrastructure in a next generation network environment 
however  we view this migration to be essential to their future growth and profitability  and as a result  their rate of migration could be at a much more accelerated rate than we currently anticipate 
we believe that in  our customers were still in the early stages of this migration and their capital spending was indicative of this stage of the migration 
for example  in  while we experienced significant growth in overall sales of our products and services deployed in traditional network structures  we experienced an even more pronounced increase in sales of our products and services for deployment in next generation networks 
we believe this trend may continue as the core technologies underlying ims mature and as our 
table of contents customers increasingly commit to a migration strategy 
we believe our expertise in call signaling  coupled with our increasing abilities to provide our customers expanded products and services geared for a next generation network environment  positions us well to pursue the opportunities that the migration to ims presents 
proposed disposition of iex contact center business unit on april   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  iex corporation  or iex 
the operations of iex are reflected in the discussions and tables within this item as our iex contact center group 
we currently anticipate that the closing of the sale of the iex shares will occur in the second quarter of  subject to certain conditions as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
as a result of our decision to sell this business unit  the results of iex s operations will be reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the quarter in which the closing occurs 
summary of our operating results for and certain key financial metrics the following is a brief summary of our performance relative to certain key financial metrics during compared to in thousands  except earnings loss per share and days sales outstanding or dso year ended december  restated statement of operations statistics revenues operating loss diluted earnings loss per share cash flows from operations balance sheet statistics cash  cash equivalents and investments accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding dso days days deferred revenue working capital shareholders equity revenues increased by in to million primarily due to i the growth in international revenues  representing an increase of million  and ii the increased demand for our product offerings domestically  in part resulting from the expansion of our product lines through strategic acquisitions  representing an increase of million 
operating loss increased from an operating loss in of million to an operating loss of million in  primarily due to certain significant and unusual charges relating to impaired technology million and impaired goodwill million associated with our t product line within our taqua reporting unit 
our diluted earnings per share for was also negatively impacted by these charges  decreasing from earnings per share of in to a per share loss of in cash flow from operations grew by in to million from million in this growth was attributable to growth in overall sales orders across all of our operating segments 
specifically  while many of our orders have not been recognized as revenue due primarily to partial shipments of the orders  we have received a portion of the non refundable payment related to these partial shipments  resulting in the significant year over year increase in our cash flow from operations 
also contributing to the increase in cash flow from operations is a reduction in our dso  as discussed below 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased during by million 
the majority of this decrease was driven by i our acquisitions of iptelorg and the minority interest in santera for cash consideration of million and ii capital expenditures of million  partially offset by positive cash flows from operations of million 
accounts receivable increased by million to million as of december  this increase was primarily attributable to the overall increase in our revenues in compared to in addition  we typically invoice a higher percentage of our customers for our extended warranty offering late in the fourth quarter of each year compared to other quarters 
as a result  we typically see an increase in accounts receivable as of each year end 
while overall accounts receivable has increased from to  our days sales outstanding  or dso  has decreased from days as of december  to days as of december   primarily due to significant increased collection efforts throughout deferred revenue increased by million or from million as of december  to million as of december   primarily due to an increase in sales arrangements that require the deferral of revenue eg  partial shipments of a sales order and increases related to our installed base of customers under our extended warranty offering 
working capital increased by from million as of december  to million as of december   primarily due to a net increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and deferred costs  partially offset by the increase in deferred revenues discussed above 
during  we determined that all of our marketable investments  regardless of stated maturity date  were available for current operations 
this  we believe  provides us with the flexibility required to respond quickly to critical business opportunities whether in the form of additional investments in internal infrastructure or strategic acquisitions of externally developed technologies or businesses to expand our product portfolio 
shareholders equity decreased by million in from million as of december  to million as of december  our net loss of million was partially offset by i amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million and ii proceeds from the issuance of shares resulting from employee stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan of million 
results of operations please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates in the following pages for a description of our significant accounting policies and our use of estimates 
revenues revenues in were million  compared with million and million in and  respectively  representing growth of in both and our revenues have increased from to due primarily to i increased geographical expansion and penetration into new markets internationally  ii continued expansion of our product offerings  including the expansion of our switching product portfolio through the acquisitions of santera in and taqua and vocaldata in and iii the continued growth of our existing product lines 
see the tables below for further details of our revenues by geographic region and by segment 
a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter results from orders that are received in that quarter  and are difficult to predict 
further  we typically generate a significant portion of our revenues for each quarter in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels based on our expectations as to future revenues  and if revenue levels were to fall below expectations  then such shortfall would cause expenses to be disproportionately high in relation to revenues 
therefore  a drop in near term demand could significantly affect revenues and margins  causing a disproportionate reduction in profits or even losses in any given quarter or year 
we believe that our future revenue growth depends in large part upon a number of factors affecting the demand for our signaling and switching products 
regarding our switching products  future revenue growth  both domestically and internationally  depends on the increasing adoption and deployment of packet switching 
table of contents technology  along with the success of our channel partners eg  alcatel 
in situations where we i sell multiple products or ii sell a combination of integrated products and services that we cannot separate into multiple elements  we are not able to recognize revenue until all of the products are shipped complete and where the services are essential to the functionality of the product  no revenue can be recognized until the services are completely delivered due to the fact that we follow the residual method of accounting as prescribed by sop as a result  our revenue may vary significantly from period to period as a result of our inability to ship an order in its entirety 
specifically  no revenue related to a sales arrangement may be recognized until all products in the sales arrangement are delivered  regardless of whether the undelivered product represents an insignificant portion of the arrangement fee 
the following table sets forth revenues from the four geographic regions in which we generate sales of our products north america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  the caribbean and latin america cala  and asia and the pacific region  including china asia pacific for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated north america emea cala asia pacific total revenues as the above table indicates  we continue to expand internationally  resulting in significant year over year growth in each of the major regions in which we operate 
we operate in four distinct business segments  the network signaling group nsg  switching solutions group ssg  communications software solutions group cssg and iex contact center group iex 
in order to provide a better understanding of the year over year changes and the underlying trends in our revenues  we have provided a discussion of revenues from each of our four operating segments 
revenues from each of our four operating segments for  and are as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated network signaling of total revenues switching solutions of total revenues communications software solutions of total revenues iex contact center of total revenues total revenues 
table of contents network signaling group nsg revenues for  and were comprised of sales of the following products and services for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated eagle stp initial systems eagle stp upgrades and extensions local number portability products customer extended warranty services other total nsg revenues our nsg revenues grew overall in due primarily to increased sales of stp initial systems and stp upgrades and extensions 
in  we experienced a growth in nsg s revenues over  due primarily to increased revenues from both new eagle stp system sales and installations and eagles stp upgrades and extensions sold to existing customers 
domestically  we derive the majority of nsg s revenue from wireless operators  as wireless networks generate significantly more signaling traffic than wireline networks and  as a result  require significantly more signaling infrastructure 
signaling traffic on our wireless customers networks in recent years has increased significantly due to several factors  including growth in the number of subscribers  the number of calls made per subscriber  minutes of use  roaming  and the use of advanced features  such as text messaging 
these factors have necessitated that the wireless operators expand their network capacity  leading to increased sales of our signaling products 
internationally  in addition to the factors affecting our domestic sales growth described above  nsg s product revenue growth depends on our ability to successfully penetrate new international markets  which often involves displacing an incumbent signaling vendor  and our ongoing ability to meet the signaling requirements of the newly acquired customers 
as indicated above  we experienced significant growth internationally in both and switching solutions group ssg revenues for  and were comprised of sales of the following product lines in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated t t t t total ssg revenues in  revenues from sales of our switching products increased primarily due to increased sales of our t product offerings  increased sales of our t media gateway product  particularly through alcatel  an oem customer  and a full year of sales from the t and t product offerings  which were obtained in our acquisitions of taqua in april and vocal data in september  respectively 
growth in our switching solutions revenues in was primarily due to i additional revenues from acquisitions consummated in and and ii increases in sales of ssg products to alcatel of million in revenues for include i a full year of revenues from our t products compared to only six months of revenues in following our acquisition of a majority interest in santera in june and 
table of contents ii sales from our t and t product lines  which resulted from our acquisitions of taqua and vocaldata discussed previously 
sales of ssg products to alcatel for  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated ssg sales to alcatel communications software solutions group cssg revenues for  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated integrated application solutions sentinel total cssg revenues growth in our communications software solutions revenues in is primarily a result of increased revenues from sales of our sentinel products as well as additional revenues from products related to our acquisition of steleus in october revenues from product lines acquired in the steleus transaction are classified as part of our integrated applications solutions ias products group 
in  revenues from sales of our ias products increased as a result of continued efforts to integrate the former steleus products into our offerings and to sell these solutions into our existing customer base 
in addition  revenues for include a full year of ias revenues compared to only approximately three months of revenues in following our acquisition of steleus 
iex contact center group revenues from contact center products increased in and due to increased sales of our totalview products and increased revenues from totalview service contracts ie  primarily maintenance service contracts  partially offset by lower sales of totalnet and other products and services  as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated totalview products totalview services totalnet and other total iex revenues cost of sales in order to provide a better understanding of the year over year changes within our cost of sales  the following is a discussion of each of the components that comprise our cost of sales cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes i materials  labor  and overhead costs paid to contract manufacturers to produce our products  ii personnel and other implementation costs incurred to install our products and iii customer service costs to provide continuing support to our customers under our warranty offerings 
cost 
table of contents of goods sold in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated cost of goods sold revenues cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues cost of goods sold in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues increased in both and the increase in cost of goods sold in absolute dollars is primarily driven by increases in revenues 
while revenues in all of our business segments increased during and  the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to revenues from our lower margin switching solutions group s products growing at a higher rate than revenues from our higher margin network signaling and other products 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we incurred approximately million  or of revenues  of significant and unusual charges that we have not historically incurred or  to extent these charges have been incurred in the past  have been insignificant 
specifically  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred certain warranty obligations aggregating million associated with i two class a defects ie  a warranty obligation resulting from our determination that we were obligated to correct a known product defect within our nsg product portfolio and ii a commitment to remedy an additional product warranty matter within our ssg product portfolio 
further  we determined that the cost associated with two of our customer contracts would exceed the expected revenues  resulting in an expected loss on these contracts upon completion of our delivery obligations in as required by the accounting literature  we have accrued the expected loss on these arrangements in the amount of approximately million in the fourth quarter of as an increase in cost of goods sold 
in the fourth quarter of  we renewed our contractual arrangement with alcatel within our ssg business unit 
under the terms of the new arrangement  we expect that the gross margins within our ssg business unit may decline significantly during compared to our margins in in addition  to the extent that revenues from sales of our lower margin product offerings  including our ssg products  continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues will continue to increase 
in addition  while we have experienced steady growth in our north american revenues of in and in  our revenues from other regions outside of north america are growing at much higher rates in and in 
sales of initial systems in international markets typically carry lower margins than sales domestically and as our sales internationally have increased at a rate greater than sales within the united states  cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues have increased from to as we enter new markets  particularly international markets  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues may continue to increase from time to time as the result of our decision to develop new sales channels and customer relationships in these emerging markets 
while this growth in sales of initial systems in international markets has had a negative impact on gross margins  we expect to achieve improved gross margins as sales of extensions increase in these markets 
pricing competition in the next generation switching market has been intense and we believe the competitive environment within this market will negatively impact our margins in the future 
in addition  changes in the following factors may also affect margins product and distribution channel mix  competition  customer discounts  supply and demand conditions in the electronic components industry  internal manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies  foreign currency fluctuations  pricing pressure as we expand internationally  additional loss contracts  if any  and general economic conditions 

table of contents amortization of purchased technology for purposes of measuring the results for each operating segment  we consider amortization of purchased technology to be part of general corporate expenses and therefore do not allocate the amortization of purchased technology to individual business segments 
amortization of purchased technology for  and was as follows in thousands for the years ended december  amortization of purchased technology related to iptelorg gmbh santera taqua vocaldata steleus iex other total as indicated in the above table  the primary reason for the decline in amortization expense relates to the purchased technology of iex  which was fully amortized in early impairment of purchased technology in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we acquired taqua in in order to expand our next generation switching portfolio to address the small switch service provider market 
based in part on market reports related to the small switch market at the time of the acquisition  we expected rapid growth in this market and  accordingly  rapid growth in the demand for taqua s products 
this market  to date  has not met the growth projections estimated by us and  as a consequence  taqua s operating results have underperformed our expectations 
throughout the first three quarters of  we continued to believe that the growth projections for this market had only been delayed but not materially reduced 
however  during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that both revenues and expected orders for the fourth quarter of and early would significantly underperform our previous expectations 
accordingly  in connection with our annual budgeting process performed during the fourth quarter of  we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the outlook for the small switch market in general and our projections and expectations for the taqua product line 
as a result of this reassessment and the significant shortfall in orders for these products in the fourth quarter of  we significantly lowered our forecast of taqua s future revenues and cash flows 
these revised projections  combined with the historical underperformance of the taqua product line  indicated that certain identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the original acquisition of taqua  specifically the purchased technology  may be impaired 
we determined that impairment indicators were present within the meaning of sfas  and therefore performed an impairment test in accordance with fas during the fourth quarter of in accordance with fas  we first determined if the future expected undiscounted cash flows related to the taqua purchased technology were less than the current carrying value of the technology 
applying this initial test  we determined that such cash flows were less than such carrying value  which indicated that an impairment of the asset existed 
to measure the impairment  we determined the fair value of the purchased technology using a discounted cash flow approach 
using this approach  the purchased technology was valued at approximately million which  when compared to its carrying value of million  indicated an 
table of contents impairment of million 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash impairment charge in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of related to the taqua purchased technology 
no impairment losses were recognized in the years ended december  and research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  consulting costs  and the cost of development equipment and supplies 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated research and development percentage of revenues the following is a summary of the year over year changes in our research and development expenses during and in thousands year over year change to to restated cost component salaries and benefits consulting and professional services supplies facilities and depreciation other total the dollar increases in salaries and benefits costs  consulting costs and supplies expenses from to were primarily attributable to increases in research activities and personnel following our acquisition of a majority interest in santera in june  our april acquisition of taqua  our september acquisition of vocaldata  and our october acquisition of steleus 
salaries and benefits costs and consulting costs also increased from to due to a full year of research and development costs attributable to the acquisitions of taqua  vocaldata and steleus being included in results  compared to only a partial year of costs associated with those same acquisitions being included in results 
in addition  our facilities costs increased by approximately million in due primarily to i a full year of depreciation and maintenance expenses related to our taqua and steleus facilities being included in results and ii the expansion of our facilities as a result of the expansion of our professional staff 
while research and development costs have increased from to  these costs have decreased consistently as a percentage of revenues due primarily to our focus on controlling costs 
we intend to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development  and we believe that our future success depends in a large part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop or acquire new products that maintain our technological competitiveness 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses are composed primarily of costs associated with our executive and administrative personnel eg  legal  finance  information technology  human resources and sales and marketing personnel and consist of i salaries and related costs  ii consulting and other professional services eg  attorneys fees  audit fees and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  iii facilities and insurance costs  and iv travel and other costs 
the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  year over year change to to restated restated restated selling  general and administrative percentage of revenues the following is a summary of the year over year changes of our selling  general and administrative expenses during and in thousands year over year change to to restated cost component salaries and benefits sales commissions consulting and professional services restatement related costs supplies facilities travel marketing and advertising other total the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses during and were primarily attributable to i our expanding global presence and the related increase in revenues  resulting in the expansion of our global sales force in proportion to our growth in revenues and ii increases in personnel following our acquisition of a majority interest in santera in june  our april acquisition of taqua  our september acquisition of vocaldata  and our october acquisition of steleus 
accordingly  each of the above expenses  particularly direct and indirect personnel related costs salaries benefits  travel and facilities  has increased on a year over year basis during and selling  general and administrative expenses also increased on a year over year basis during as a result of restatement related expenses  which totaled approximately million 
while selling  general and administrative costs have increased in dollars from to  these costs have remained fairly consistent as a percentage of revenues 
we have and intend to continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations by examining the way in which we operate in order to identify opportunities for cost savings and improvement 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded various intangible assets including trademarks  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions is as follows in thousands for the years ended december  year over year change to to iex santera taqua vocaldata steleus iptelorg as the table above indicates  the increase in amortization of intangible assets in was due primarily to recording a full year in of amortization of intangibles related to the vocaldata and steleus acquisitions compared to only a partial year in  partially offset by a decrease in amortization of the intangibles arising from the acquisitions of i iex and ii a majority interest in santera in the intangibles relating to iex and the santera acquisition became fully amortized in and  respectively 
in  the increase in amortization was due primarily to the acquisitions of a majority interest in santera in and taqua  vocaldata and steleus in  offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles related to the iex acquisition  which became fully amortized in mid acquired in process research and development during  and we made selective strategic acquisitions of entities in order to enhance and expand our product offerings 
at the time of each acquisition  these acquired companies had certain technology  products and functionality under development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  such technology  products and functionality were considered by us to be in process research and development ipr d and the fair value of these items was expensed at the acquisition date 
the following table is a summary of ipr d expense for  and  related to the acquisitions described below in thousands for the years ended december  iptelorg gmbh santera taqua vocaldata steleus total iptelorg gmbh 
on july   we completed the acquisition of iptelorg  a developer of sip routing software 
we believe that iptelorg s technology and certain products and functionality under development by iptelorg at the time of acquisition will enhance our current network signaling offerings 
iptelorg s ipr d related to further development of iptelorg s sip routing proxy technology as well as technologies related to an ip multimedia subsystem 
we estimated the fair value of the ipr d acquired in our acquisition of iptelorg to be million 
we included million of expense relating to this ipr d under the heading acquired in process research and development in the statement of operations for at the date of our acquisition of iptelorg  we estimated that the ipr d relating to iptelorg s products ranged from to complete and 
table of contents that we expected to incur up to an additional  to complete these development projects 
completion of these projects is expected to occur in we estimated the fair value of the ipr d using the income valuation approach and a discount rate of 
the discount rate was selected based in part on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted cash flows 
santera systems inc on june   we acquired a controlling ownership interest in santera systems inc santera  a company with a core competency in packet switching technology 
through this acquisition  we acquired the rights to two significant technology projects under development at santera that we believe enhance our switching products and services 
these ipr d projects related to versions x and x of santera s base product  santeraone 
we estimated the fair value of the ipr d acquired in our acquisition of santera to be million 
we included million of expense relating to this ipr d under the heading acquired in process research and development in the statement of operations for at the date of our acquisition of santera  we estimated that the ipr d relating to versions x and x was complete and that we expected to incur up to an additional million and million in the remainder of and to complete these development projects 
at the date of our acquisition  version x was expected to be released in and version x was expected to be released in we estimated the fair value of the ipr d using the income valuation approach and a discount rate of 
the discount rate was selected based in part on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted cash flows 
on october   we acquired the remaining shares of capital stock of santera owned by santera s minority stockholders 
as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest  santera became a wholly owned subsidiary of tekelec as of that date 
at the time of this acquisition  santera had three significant ipr d projects related to versions  and of its base product  the t formerly santeraone 
we estimated the fair value of the ipr d to be approximately million 
as we acquired only the remaining of santera  we included million of expense relating to this ipr d under the heading acquired in process research and development in the statement of operations for at the date of our acquisition of santera  we estimated the ipr d relating to versions  and to be  and complete  respectively  and that we expected to incur up to an additional million  million and million in the remainder of  and  respectively  to complete these development projects 
we estimated the fair value of the ipr d using the income valuation approach and a discount rate of

as a result of this transaction  santera recognized a gain of million 
in addition  we can receive up to an additional  shares of alcatel held in escrow pending the resolution of any acquisition related indemnification claims made by alcatel against the former spatial stockholders 
the shares are anticipated to be released from escrow beginning months from the acquisition date 
we may recognize additional gains when and if these shares are released from escrow 
other income expense 
other expense in consisted primarily of foreign currency exchange losses resulting from transactions in foreign currencies where our exposure to foreign currency risks were not mitigated through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and net losses incurred on sale of investments  primarily consisting of losses related to the sale of shares of alcatel in the first quarter of as we expand our international business further  we will continue to enter into a greater number of transactions denominated 
table of contents in currencies other than the us dollar  and will therefore be exposed to greater risk related to foreign currency fluctuation 
provision for income taxes during  and  we recognized income tax expense benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
provisions for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations were  and for  and  respectively 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate for  and minority interest minority interest represents the losses of santera allocable to santera s minority stockholders 
prior to october   the date of our acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of santera owned by santera s minority stockholders  the net income and losses of santera were allocated between tekelec and the minority interest based on their relative interests in the equity of santera and the related liquidation preferences 
this approach required net losses to be allocated first to the series a preferred stock  held primarily by the minority interest  until fully absorbed and then to the series b preferred stock held by us 
subsequent net income was allocated first to the series b preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized net losses allocated to series b preferred stock 
additional net income was then allocated to the series a preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized losses allocated to series a preferred stock and then to common stock in proportion to their relative ownership interests in the equity of santera

our working capital increased to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to i the determination in that we would make all of our investments available to fund current operations  resulting in these investments being classified as short term versus long term and ii cash flows from operations of million during  partially offset by the use of short term investments to fund acquisitions of million 
with a strong working capital position  we 
table of contents believe that we have the flexibility to continue to invest in further development of our technology and  when necessary or appropriate  make selective acquisitions to continue to strengthen our product portfolio 
the significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  reduced by trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  accrued payroll and related expenses and current portion of deferred revenues 
we continue to generate positive cash flows from operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december   we had a million line of credit collateralized by a pledged investment account held with an intermediary financial institution 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility  however  we have utilized  of the facility to secure a letter of credit 
as of december   substantially all of our short term investments had investment grade ratings and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at december  were in such position solely due to interest rate changes  sector credit rating changes or company specific rating changes 
as we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value  we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis on these securities 
when evaluating our investments for possible impairment  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis  the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
the declines in our securities are considered to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  we do not believe these securities are impaired as of december  we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in revenues resulting from a decline in demand for our products or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during  or we currently have million outstanding of senior subordinated convertible notes due june the notes which were issued under an indenture dated as of june  the indenture between deutsche bank trust company americas the trustee and us 
prior to the filing of this annual report on form k  we were in default of our obligation under section of the indenture  which required us to file with the trustee this annual report within days after the prescribed due date for the filing with the securities and exchange commission the commission 
as a result of the filing of this form k  we cured this default under the indenture 
we have also failed to timely deliver our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  the first quarter form q to the trustee on or before may   which resulted in an additional default under the indenture which  if not cured or waived within days after any notice of such default is delivered to us by the trustee or by the holders of or more in aggregate principal amount of the notes  will allow the trustee or holders of or more in aggregate principal amount of the notes to accelerate the payment of indebtedness under the indenture 
we currently expect to file our first quarter form q with the commission and deliver it to the trustee on or before june  and  accordingly  believe we will be able to cure this default under the indenture 
the indenture also provides that if our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq national market  any holder of notes may require the company to redeem the holder s notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
although the company is not currently in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c as a result of our failure to timely file this annual report and the first quarter form q with the sec  the nasdaq stock market has determined to continue the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  subject to the condition that the company file with the commission  on or before july   this annual report  all required restatements and the first quarter form q 
if we fail to meet the requirements of the nasdaq national market by july   then the individual 
table of contents holders of the notes may require repayment of their notes under the indenture 
as discussed above  we currently expect to meet these conditions 
contractual obligations as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments are as follows in thousands total to to and beyond long term convertible debt interest due on long term convertible debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations current liabilities on the balance sheet purchase obligations total current liabilities in the above table represents current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet  reduced by the current portion of capital lease obligations and the current portion of deferred revenues as deferred revenues will not be settled using cash payments  but rather with the provision of goods and services 
from time to time in the normal course of business we may enter into purchasing agreements with our suppliers that require us to accept delivery of  and remit full payment for  finished products that we have ordered  finished products that we requested be held as safety stock  and work in process started on our behalf in the event we cancel or terminate the purchasing agreement 
it is not our intent  nor is it reasonably likely  that we would cancel a purchase order that we have executed 
because these agreements do not specify fixed or minimum quantities  do not specify minimum or variable price provisions  and do not specify the approximate timing of the transaction  we have no basis to estimate any future liability under these agreements 
we lease a number of facilities throughout the united states and internationally under operating leases that range from one month to ten years 
we believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our needs at least through  and that we will be able to obtain additional space when  where and as needed on acceptable terms 
cash flows as discussed above  one of the primary sources of our liquidity is our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations 
the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased on a year over year basis during primarily as the result of increases in sales orders across our operating segments  which increased both our total revenues from operations for the year  as well as our total deferred revenue balance as of december  specifically  while many of sales orders have not been recognized as revenue due primarily to partial shipments of the orders  we have received a portion of the non refundable payment related to these partial shipments  resulting in the significant year over year increase in our cash flows from operations 
also contributing to the increase in cash flows from operations is a reduction in our dso 
cash 
table of contents provided by operating activities decreased on a year over year basis during primarily due to a decrease in earnings adjusted for non cash gains on sales of certain investments 
during  and  our cash flows from operations were primarily derived from i our earnings from ongoing operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  bad debt  write downs of inventory and non cash impairment charges  ii the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options  which reduces our cash outlay for income tax expense  and iii changes in our working capital  which are primarily composed of net increases in accounts receivable  increases in inventories and increases in deferred revenue and associated deferred costs collectively representing net cash outflows of million  million and million in  and  respectively  partially offset by changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related expenses 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to operate a cash positive business in our ability to meet these expectations depends on our ability to achieve positive earnings 
our ability to generate future cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to technological changes and increasing competition  or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our investment activities primarily relate to i transactions within our investments  ii strategic acquisitions  and iii the purchase of property and equipment 
for and our cash provided by investing activities included million and million  respectively  of net cash inflows associated with sales of available for sale securities from our short term investment portfolio  while in we invested a net cash amount of million in available for sale investments 
acquisition related cash outflows were million in  relating to the cash consideration component of our acquisitions of iptelorg and the santera minority interest 
in cash outflows relating to acquisitions was million  relating to the cash consideration component of our acquisitions of taqua  vocaldata and steleus 
in  the cash component of the consideration paid to acquire a majority interest in santera amounted to million 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these acquisitions 
our investment in new property and equipment amounted to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased during and primarily due to the continued growth of our global operations and resulting increase in employee headcount 
we intend to continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures  while making strategic investments to develop our existing products and replace certain older computer and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our expanding workforce 
accordingly  we expect our total capital expenditures to be between million and million for cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the change in cash flows from financing activities from net cash outflows in to positive cash inflows during and was primarily due to payments made to retire existing  and costs incurred to issue new  convertible debt in for  and  our remaining financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of debt of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
litigation with bouygues telecom as further described in item legal proceedings  bouygues telecom  sa  a french telecommunications operator filed a legal complaint against us seeking damages for economic losses caused by a service 
table of contents interruption bouygues telecom experienced 
the amount of damages sought by bouygues telecom is currently million plus unspecified interest  punitive damages and attorneys fees and costs 
at this stage of the litigation  we cannot assess the likely outcome of this matter  however  an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
financial and market risks we operate internationally and thus are exposed to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on receivables  payables and intercompany balances denominated in a foreign currency 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce or eliminate  and efficiently manage  the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results as effectively as possible 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on a monthly basis 
we enter into multiple forward contracts throughout a given month to match and mitigate our changing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is principally due to receivables generated from sales denominated in foreign currencies 
our exposure fluctuates as we generate new sales in foreign currencies and as existing receivables related to sales in foreign currencies are collected 
our foreign currency forward contracts generally will have terms of one month or less and are typically structured to expire on the last fiscal day of any given month 
to the extent necessary to continue to mitigate our risk  on the last fiscal day of any given month  we enter into new foreign currency forward contracts 
as of december   we had four foreign currency contracts outstanding  as follows contract amount contract fair local currency amount value us australian dollars aud contracts to pay aud receive us aud   euros eur contracts to pay eur receive us eur   brazilian real brl contracts to pay brl receive us brl   canadian dollars cad contracts to pay cad receive us cad   we entered into these contracts during the last day of our fiscal year and as such  the fair value of these contracts individually and in the aggregate was not significant as of december  for the years ending december   and  our gain or loss from foreign currency forward contracts was   and  respectively  which was generally offset by the remeasurement gain or loss on the underlying receivables 
please refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivatives and hedging activities 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
at any time  a significant rise or decrease in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as the fixed income securities we hold are subject to interest rate risk 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   then the fair value of our investments would decline by approximately million 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
we have invested in privately held companies  some of which are in startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are 
table of contents developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
these investments are primarily carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment 
no impairment charges were recognized during the years ended december   or there have been no significant borrowings under our variable rate credit facilities 
all of our outstanding long term debt is fixed rate and not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the fair value of our long term debt will increase or decrease as interest rates decrease or increase  respectively 
with respect to trade receivables  we sell network signaling  switching solutions  communications software solutions  and contact center systems worldwide primarily to telephone operating companies  equipment manufacturers and corporations that use our systems to design  install  maintain  test and operate communications equipment and networks 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  and generally collateral is not required 
generally  payment terms stipulate payment within days of shipment and currently  we do not engage in leasing or other customer financing arrangements 
many of our international sales are secured with export accounts receivable insurance or letters of credit 
although we have processes in place to monitor and mitigate credit risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in eliminating such risk 
our exposure to credit risk may increase as a result of weakened financial conditions in certain market segments 
credit losses for customers we deem to pose substantial collection risks have been provided for in the financial statements 
historically  credit losses have been within management s expectations 
future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
as of december   we leased facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring between and rent expense under operating leases for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of december  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled contractual obligations 
seasonality our first quarter sales orders have typically been lower than the sales orders in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because i many of our customers utilize a significant portion of their capital budgets at the end of their fiscal year  ii the majority of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january  and iii capital expenditures tend to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
we anticipate that this seasonality will continue 
the seasonality between the fourth quarter and first quarter may be impacted by a variety of factors  including changes in the global economy and other factors 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in item a 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and the application of gaap requires management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates 
in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely 
table of contents to occur 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  provision for inventory obsolescence  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  product warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock based compensation  restructuring activities  depreciation methodology  etc our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies  our critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures with our disclosure and audit committees 
these policies and our procedures are described below 
in addition  please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies  each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales or licensing of our i telecommunications products  ii professional services including installation  training  and general support  and iii warranty related support  comprised of telephone support  repair and return of defective products  and product updates commonly referred to as maintenance  post contract customer support or pcs 
our customers generally purchase a combination of our products and services as part of a multiple element arrangement 
our telecommunications solutions are comprised of hardware and or software components ranging from exclusively a software solution  such as our iex business unit s product offerings  to solutions that are much more hardware intensive  such as our nsg and ssg business unit s product offerings 
our assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition guidance involves significant judgment 
for instance  the determination of whether the software component of our telecommunications solutions is more than incidental to the related product in a sales arrangement can impact whether the entire sales arrangement is accounted for under software revenue recognition guidance or more general revenue recognition guidance 
this assessment has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
as the software component of all of our product offerings is generally deemed to be more than incidental to the products being provided  we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements collectively sop 
in applying existing revenue recognition guidance and especially the revenue recognition guidance of sop  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of product  warranty and professional services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
in addition to estimating the timing and amount of revenue to recognize  we must evaluate whether the estimated costs required to provide any undelivered elements exceed the expected revenue allocated to those elements 
when 
table of contents total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon the estimated cost of the remaining equipment to be delivered and the consulting personnel delivering the services 
as a result of applying these judgments  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized approximately million in estimated losses on existing contracts with our customers 
the complexity of current revenue guidance  in particular sop  and the related estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of current revenue recognition guidance  affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the key areas where we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period determining separate elements and allocating value to those elements for arrangements that involve multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement must be allocated to each of the elements based on the individual element s fair value 
each arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the arrangement have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
under sop  the determination of fair value must be based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value vsoe  which is limited to the price of that element when sold separately 
sales of our products always include at least a year of warranty coverage  which we have determined contains post contract customer support pcs elements as defined by sop inasmuch as we do not sell our products separately from this warranty coverage  and we rarely sell our products on a standalone basis  we are unable to establish vsoe for our products 
accordingly  we utilize the residual method as prescribed by sop to allocate revenue to each of the elements in an arrangement 
under the residual method  we allocate the total fee in an arrangement first to the undelivered elements ie  typically professional services and warranty offerings based on the vsoe of those elements and the remaining  or residual  portion of the fee to the delivered elements ie  typically the product or products 
we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement ie  professional services and warranty coverage based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we determine the fair value of the warranty portion of an arrangement based on the price charged to the customer for extending their warranty coverage 
we determine the fair value of the professional services portion of an arrangement based on the rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from our products 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of an arrangement  we defer revenue until the earlier of i delivery or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
in addition to evaluating the fair value of each element of an arrangement  we consider whether the elements can be separated for revenue recognition purposes under sop in making this determination  we consider the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the collectibility of the product fee 
product revenue for substantially all of our arrangements  we defer revenue for the fair value of the warranty offering and professional services to be provided to the customer and recognize revenue for all products in an arrangement when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery of the last product has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we generally evaluate each of these criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a non cancelable agreement such as an irrevocable customer purchase order  contract  etc 
to be evidence of an arrangement 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
delivery is considered to occur when title to our products has passed to the customer  which typically occurs at physical delivery of the products to a common carrier 
for arrangements with systems integrators and oem customers  we recognize revenue when title to the last product in a multiple element arrangement has passed 
for arrangements with resellers  we generally recognize revenue upon evidence of sell through to the end customer 
the fee is fixed and determinable 
we assess whether fees are fixed and determinable at the time of sale 
our standard payment terms may vary based on the country in which the arrangement is executed and the credit standing of the individual customer  among other factors 
we generally consider payments that are due within six months of shipment or acceptance to be fixed or determinable based upon our successful collection history on such arrangements and evaluate payment terms in excess of six months but less than one year on a case by case basis as to whether the fee is fixed or determinable 
in addition  we only consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
while many of our arrangements do not include customer acceptance provisions  certain arrangements include acceptance provisions  which are based on our published specifications 
revenue is recognized upon shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided that we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria and we have an established history with similar transactions 
if an arrangement includes acceptance provisions that are short term in nature  we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
in the event we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of returns  we defer revenue until the earlier that such estimate can reasonably be made or receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if the acceptance provisions are long term in nature or the acceptance is based upon customer specified criteria for which we cannot reliably demonstrate that the delivered product meets all the specified criteria  revenue is deferred until the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
our arrangements may include penalty provisions 
if an arrangement includes penalty provisions eg  for late delivery or installation of the product  we defer the portion of the arrangement subject to forfeiture under the penalty provision of the arrangement until the earlier of i a determination that the penalty was not incurred  ii the customer waives its rights to the penalty  or iii the customer s right to assess the penalty lapses 
warranty maintenance revenue our arrangements typically provide for one year of warranty coverage the standard warranty ending the sooner of one year after installation or months after shipment 
we typically provide our standard warranty coverage at no additional charge to our customer 
we allocate a portion of the arrangement fee to the standard warranty based on the vsoe of its fair value 
the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the standard warranty based on the number of days of warranty coverage during each period 
our customers can extend their warranty coverage outside the term of the standard warranty through our customer extended warranty service cews offerings 
renewal rates for cews are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net product fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional services revenue professional services revenue primarily consists of implementation services related to the installation of our products and training revenues 
our products are ready to use by the customer upon receipt and  
table of contents accordingly  our implementation services do not involve significant customization to or development of the product or any underlying software code embedded in the product 
substantially all of our professional service arrangements are related to installation and training services and are billed on a fixed fee basis 
we typically recognize the revenue related to our fixed fee service arrangements upon completion of the services  as these services are relatively short term in nature ie  typically a matter of days or  in limited cases  several weeks 
for arrangements that are billed on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
if there exists a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the professional services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
provision for doubtful accounts we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers  among other factors  i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable eg  product  professional services  maintenance  etc  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  which has ranged up to of total revenues per year during the last three years  v our historical write offs and recoveries  vi the credit worthiness of each customer  vii the economic conditions within the telecommunications industry  and viii general economic conditions 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories our inventory balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis inventories are reviewed and written down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
any adjustment to our inventory as a result of an estimated obsolescence or net realizable condition is reflected as a component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our provision for inventory obsolescence was approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates could be influenced by sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements  technological changes and changes in customer requirements 
investments marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value  and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as a separate component of 
table of contents shareholders equity net of tax 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments on a quarterly basis 
this review includes an evaluation of historical and projected financial performance of the investee  expected cash needs of the investee  recent funding events of the investee  general market conditions  industry and sector performance  and changes in technology  among other factors 
we also consider the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment 
other than temporary impairments are recognized in earnings if i the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period  which we generally define as nine to twelve months  ii the issuer has experienced significant financial declines  or iii the issuer has experienced difficulties in raising capital to continue operations  among other factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
to date  we have had no such other than temporary declines below cost basis 
intangible assets and goodwill we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while ipr d  if any  is recorded as an expense at the acquisition date 
the majority of the entities acquired by us do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill or intangibles 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet related to goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
specifically  the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets impact future amortization and the amounts assigned to ipr d are expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
as required by sfas  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment periodically and record any necessary impairment in accordance with sfas we are amortizing our intangible assets as follows i acquired technology  customer contracts and non compete agreements are currently being amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and ii customer relationship intangible assets are currently being amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the greater of the straight line method or the estimated customer attrition rates 
impairment of long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas we have determined that we have six reporting units  consisting of i nsg business unit  ii cssg business unit  iii iex contact center business unit  and iv santera  taqua and vocal data reporting units  which comprise our ssg business unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds their fair value  if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 

table of contents we evaluate all of our long lived assets primarily property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in the fourth quarter of we determined that certain intangible assets and the goodwill associated with our taqua reporting unit were impaired 
accordingly  we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of million  consisting of a million charge associated with the goodwill and million associated with the acquired technology intangible asset 
as of december   the net carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets ie  the primary asset categories in which we have experienced impairment charges in the past were million and million  respectively 
while we do not currently believe any of our long lived assets are impaired  and we do not anticipate an impairment in the near term  if a change in circumstances were to occur requiring an assessment of impairment  then we would be required to evaluate whether the future cash flows related to the asset will be greater than its carrying value at the time of the impairment test 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our operations  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
if such an evaluation resulted in an impairment of any of our long lived assets  such impairment would be recorded in the period we make the impairment determination 
product warranty costs our sales arrangements with our customers typically provide for to months of warranty coverage the standard warranty ending the sooner of one year from installation or months after shipment 
our customers can extend their warranty coverage outside the term of the standard warranty through our customer extended warranty service cews offerings 
as discussed further above under the section entitled revenue recognition  we account for our standard warranty and cews offerings as separate elements of an arrangement  with the fair value of these elements recognized as revenue ratably over the service period 
accordingly  we expense all costs associated with these elements as incurred 
for purposes of determining when the cost of our warranty offerings has been incurred  we follow the guidance of ftb accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts ftb 
under ftb  costs must be recognized as incurred when a warranty event occurs  which may precede the expenditures to satisfy the warranty claim 
while we generally expense all costs as the expenditure is made  we accrue the costs expected to be incurred with a specific product defect  which is generally a defect that is classified as a class a defect 
a class a defect is a designation that obligates us to correct a pervasive defect in one of our products 
in the case of a class a defect or specific known product defect that we have committed to remedy  we accrue the expected costs to be incurred at the time we determine that its probable that we have an obligation to repair a product defect and the expected expenditures are estimable 
all warranty related expenses are reflected within cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have historically had very few class a designated warranty events and accordingly have generally expensed the cost of our warranty obligations as incurred 
in  we had three class a designated events or other events that obligated us to satisfy specific warranty obligations 
accordingly  we established a warranty reserve within accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for these events of million as of december  our warranty reserve is based on our estimates of the associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
further  if we continue to experience an increase in warranty 
table of contents claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than the expectations on which the accrual has been based  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
certain of our cews agreements include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we fail to perform to specific service level requirements 
arrangements that include these indemnification provisions typically provide for a limit on the amount of damages that we may be obligated to pay our customers 
in addition to these indemnification provisions  our agreements typically include warranties that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable product documentation and that the services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards 
we do not believe that these warranty or indemnity obligations represent a separate element in the arrangement because fulfillment of these obligations is consistent with our obligations under our standard warranty 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs associated with these warranties 
stock based compensation for the years ended on and prior to december   we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and interpretations thereof collectively apb versus the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
we record and measure deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally four years 
as described further below under recent accounting pronouncements  the fasb recently issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  a revision to sfas sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under the purchase plan  stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units  and stock appreciation rights 
effective january   sfas r will require us to expense share based payment awards as compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the stock based payment awards 
we are still evaluating the impact of sfas r on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  however  we currently estimate that  upon adoption of sfas r  our stock based compensation expense after tax could be as much as million for this is a preliminary estimate of the impact and is based on the expense associated with stock options outstanding as of december  including stock based compensation under our employee stock purchase plan and a preliminary estimate of stock based compensation expected to be issued during the year 
sfas r also will require us to change the classification of certain tax benefits from share based compensation deductions to financing rather than operating cash flows 
the adoption and subsequent application of fas r is expected to be complex and will require us to make certain subjective judgments 
the actual impact to our annual earnings in could differ materially from our current estimate 
contingent liabilities we have a number of unresolved regulatory  legal and tax matters  as discussed further in note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas 
in accordance with sfas  a loss contingency is charged to income when i it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both those conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we expense all legal costs incurred to resolve regulatory  legal and tax matters as incurred 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by sfas  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable 
because of 
table of contents uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal and tax counsel  and recent legal and tax rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
as additional information becomes available  we reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
restructuring and related expenses we account for restructuring and related expenses in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value  ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period  iii liabilities related to an operating lease contract be recorded at fair value and measured when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity ie  the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract  and iv all other costs related to an exit or disposal activity be expensed as incurred 
we account for severance costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the severance benefits provided as part of restructurings are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement  and accordingly  we have accrued a liability for expected severance costs 
restructuring liabilities are included in accrued expenses and accrued payroll and the related costs are reflected as operating expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
during and  we incurred restructuring costs of million and million  respectively  as described further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements collectively  the restructurings 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings  we had to make significant estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings 
these estimates may vary significantly from actual costs depending  in part  upon factors that may be beyond our control 
we will continue to review the status of our restructurings obligations on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to these obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
income taxes we determine a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest in santera on october  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the ownership threshold provided under income tax regulations for inclusion of santera in our consolidated federal income tax return has been met 
we have removed the valuation allowance on santera s net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in future consolidated federal income tax returns of tekelec 
the elimination of this valuation allowance was recorded through purchase price accounting as an adjustment to goodwill 
realization of the remaining net deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount of our income in carryback years and on our generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
should it be determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax 
table of contents assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
tax liabilities can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for an additional valuation allowance on our remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we assess the likelihood of the ultimate determination of various contingent tax liabilities that arise in different tax jurisdictions 
these tax matters can be complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
we establish reserves for tax contingencies when we believe an unfavorable outcome is likely to occur and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
although we believe these positions are fully supportable  we consider the likelihood of potential challenges and sustainability of such challenges upon examination 
changes in our tax contingency reserves have occurred and are likely to continue to occur as our assessments change based on current facts and circumstances such as further developments and progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
providing only pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to financial statements is no longer an alternative 
we are required to adopt sfas r effective january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all prior periods presented or for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
prior to the effective date of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 as permitted by sfas  and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options as long as the exercise price was at least equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will cause our reported stock compensation cost to materially increase beginning in our first quarter of and will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
although we are still evaluating the impact of sfas r on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  we currently estimate that  upon adoption of sfas r  our stock based compensation expense after tax for could be as much as million 
this is a preliminary estimate of the impact and is based on the expense associated with stock options outstanding as of december  including stock based compensation under our employee stock purchase plan and a preliminary estimate of stock based compensation expected to be issued during the year 
sfas r also will require us to change the classification of certain tax benefits from share based compensation deductions to financing rather than operating cash flows 
the adoption and subsequent application of fas r is expected to be complex and will require us to make certain subjective judgments 
the actual impact to our annual earnings in could differ materially from our current estimate
