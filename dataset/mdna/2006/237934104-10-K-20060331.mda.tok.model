item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing  installing and supporting data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
the market for data storage products and services is large 
idc estimates that external disk storage revenue grew more than year over year and networked storage san and nas grew nearly year over year 
we have locations throughout the united states with the highest concentration of revenues in the central states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with datalink and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data storage market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  datalink s market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data storage industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as datalink to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for datalink  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scaleable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on increasing productivity of our sales and technical teams in our existing locations 
growing our customer support revenue and market share 
we believe that our customer support services offerings are becoming increasingly attractive to companies looking for system wide integrated support 
increasing our professional services revenues 
we believe there is an opportunity to sell more of our data storage services such as implementation services  storage environment assessments and on site data storage management and architecture services 
exploring potential regional acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and engineering teams to increase productivity 
hiring additional customer support staff and enhancing the customer support staff s communications and call management capabilities 
developing more effective delivery capabilities for professional services and solutions 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including that we may not increase our productivity and may lose  or not successfully recruit and retain key sales  technical or other personnel 
competition is intense and may adversely impact our profit margin 
customers have many options for data storage products and services 
we may not identify suitable acquisition candidates

our product sales increased in from to million  and increased in from to million 
our service sales  which include customer support  consulting and installation services  increased in from to million  and remained relatively flat between and at million as compared to million 
the increase in our product sales in as compared to reflects a greater number of customers funding large projects  particularly for enhanced data recovery technology solutions 
we had an increase in customers representing more than  in annual revenues from in to in since  we have continued to increase the productivity of our sales executives

the increase in the average number of account executives from to reflects our hiring of experienced  quality account executives in key geographic locations 
the decline in the number of account executives from to reflects our closure of selected offices and turnover primarily in late calendar the increase in our service revenues for over reflects an increase in all categories of our service revenue 
customer support contract revenues increased million or  consulting service revenues increased million or and installation and configuration service revenues increased million or 
with the growth in our product revenues  we continue to successfully sell our installation and configuration services 
the slight increase in our service revenues between and reflects a million increase in consulting service revenues  offset by a million decrease in installation and configuration service revenues and a  decrease in customer support contract revenues 
in  we completed a particularly large storage solution installation and configuration project  but did not renew a large customer support contract 
we derived approximately of our sales from our customer  gateway  inc  during we had no other customers that comprised more than of our sales in  or gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  which was a decrease from in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to in as compared to in and as compared to in the percentage improvement in both and reflects the increase in enhanced data recovery technology solution purchases made by our customers for which we achieved a higher gross profit 
we have various programs in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our and product gross profit 
these vendor incentive programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales increased to in as compared to in and decreased as compared to in the percentage increase in as compared to reflects an improvement in our gross profit percentage for customer support contract renewals 
the percentage decrease in as compared to is primarily due a single large installation and configuration project in on which we achieved a higher than normal gross profit percentage 
for  we also failed to renew a few large customer support contracts 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars is primarily a result of higher commission and bonus expenses of million due to the higher sales volume in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for as compared to is also a result of higher commission expense of million due to a change in compensation plans and higher sales volume 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from to reflects better leverage of our fixed costs as revenues increased in the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from as compared to resulted from the increase in commission expenses due to compensation plan changes 
as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due to a decrease of  in depreciation expense primarily for our customer relationship management system and reduced facilities expenses of  related to the sublease of our chanhassen facility 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in variable compensation for executives and managers of  and an increase in accounting  legal and consulting fees of  for fees related to sec and sarbanes oxley compliance activity 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in compared to is due to lower depreciation expense primarily for our customer relationship management system of  and reduced facilities expenses of  related to our office closures and subleases 
our general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales for as compared to and for as compared to  due to the reduced spending coupled with an increase in sales 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of million related to a increase in headcount coupled with higher health insurance expenses and variable compensation expenses 
the decrease in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due to  of compensation savings associated with a reduction in the number of engineers and engineering managers  offset by an increase in outside consulting expenses of  and a  increase in travel and entertainment expenses 
the increase in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of higher engineering expenses despite the growth in revenues 
we added personnel resources for our customer support desk staff 
the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of higher revenues and lower expenses in overall cost reduction initiatives 
because of the difficult economic climate for technology spending that we faced over the past several years  and with our recent operating losses  we have actively sought to reduce costs across our business 
in october  we announced several cost reduction initiatives and management changes 
these changes resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
as part of these cost reduction initiatives  we reduced our staff by in employee severance charges were  we also announced the closure of four offices 
office closing costs for lease terminations were  the office closures included closing an office and terminating personnel from our opensystems 
com  inc acquisition in november  resulting in an impairment of our customer base intangible asset 
the resulting impairment charge of the asset was  in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee will pay us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  in the first quarter of  we incurred a one time  non cash charge of million related to the sublease and lot sale 
we obtained cost savings of approximately  in as a result of the sublease agreement and expect to achieve comparable savings in future years during the sublease term 
intangible amortization 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from  in and  in the amortization relates primarily to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november we test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
for and  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge on our opensystems 
com customer base intangible asset in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
we fully amortized the remaining customer base intangible asset in during  we amortized the remaining  balance of the customer base intangible asset we acquired in our july acquisition of direct connect systems  inc operating loss 
we incurred operating losses of million in and and million in since the restructuring in october  our financial results have steadily improved 
excluding the sublease charge of million in the first quarter of  we generated operating income of  in in the fourth quarter of  we generated net income of million 
however  we expect to post a slight net loss to a slight profit for the first quarter ending march  this relates to an expected decrease in sales  typically our slowest quarter  and an expected increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of primarily due to normal recurring costs more heavily weighted to the early part of the year 
the higher costs relate to payroll taxes  public reporting and benefit accruals 
the reduction in our operating losses of million for as compared to is a result of million of restructuring charges included in the operating loss and the favorable impact of our cost reduction efforts in income taxes 
we had no income tax benefit or expense in or we provided for an income tax benefit of  in the income tax benefit generated for represents a higher than expected federal income tax refund from our tax return 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  which are currently fully reserved  is dependent upon carry back to prior periods and upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of taxable losses in  and and the near term uncertainty of taxable income  we cannot reasonably predict when or if we will realize these deductible differences 
in addition  we do not have the ability to realize future income tax benefits on future losses 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and we have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as the audited information 
in our opinion  we have made all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below

in thousands net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general or the geographic and industry specific markets in which we are currently active  or may be in the future 
in addition  economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
further  our success in integrating any acquired business or in opening any new field offices could impact our net sales 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations and the proceeds from our offerings of our common stock 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to  in and million in significant items which impacted our operating cash flows in were a million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increasing sales activity over the prior year 
an million increase in accounts payable reflecting the increase in business with our vendors for our increasing sales activity 
a net increase of million related to the sublease of part of our chanhassen facility 
this includes the million non cash charge related to the sublease and lot sale offset by million of amortization for the year 
a million increase in inventories shipped but not installed for our backlog of orders at the beginning of a net million increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer typically pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows 
the cash provided in resulted from a million increase in accounts receivable  reflecting increasing sales activity offset by an increase in accured expenses for employee bonus incentives 
a million increase in accounts payable due to higher sales activity 
a net increase in million in deferred customer support contracts 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets 
this included a million income tax refund  a million reduction in inventory shipped but not installed with fewer projects left to be installed at year end  a  reduction in field evaluation inventory and a million reduction in accounts receivable due to an improvement in our days sales outstanding 
these reductions were partially offset by a million reduction in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in   in and million in in  we used this cash to complete the facility build out related to our chanhassen sublease  purchase computer equipment and provide further enhancements to our web enabled reporting tools 
in  we used this cash to purchase computer equipment  complete a data warehouse project and provide further enhancements to our business reporting software tool 
in  we used this cash to complete our own storage and data recovery project  purchase computer equipment and provide further enhancements to our customer relationship management information systems and our business reporting software tool 
cash provided in financing activities in  and was   and  respectively  all of which we received from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of options 
we discontinued our employee stock purchase plan in december our bank revolving credit facility expired in june we have not renewed it or pursued a new facility 
we have no outstanding debt  and if the need should arise to borrow funds  we believe that we could obtain a secured facility 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
we have an year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately million 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied 
the initial term of the sublease is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublease requires rent payments ranging from  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consisting of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands lease obligations sublease agreements net lease obligations thereafter in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
the rent includes the costs of common area management  common systems repairs  real estate taxes and standard utilities 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  which we originally acquired in for  we incurred the following charges in the first quarter of associated with our sublease and related activities item sublease charge rent reserve excess of lease expense over sublease income accelerated depreciation loss on land sale total we also incurred cash expenditures  for leasehold improvements and transaction fees  associated with our sublease and the related activities  net of the proceeds from our lot sale  at  we capitalized these cash outlays and are amortizing them over the lease term 
we believe that our current cash balance and funds generated from operations will finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we believe if the need should arise to borrow funds  we could obtain a secured facility 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures during primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we realize revenue from the design  installation and support of data storage solutions  which may include hardware  software and services 
we recognize revenue when we have met our obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales 
we sell software and hardware products on both a free standing basis without any services and as data storage solutions bundled with our installation and configuration services bundled arrangements 
product sales without service 
if we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services with it  we recognize the product revenues upon shipment 
product sales with service 
if we sell a bundled arrangement  then we defer recognizing any revenues on it until we finish our installation and or configuration work 
we account for the hardware  software and service elements of our bundled arrangements by applying the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop pursuant to the provisions of sop  we apply contract accounting to our bundled arrangements 
in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  we apply the completed contract method 
factors we have considered in applying the completed contract method accounting include i the relatively short duration of our contracts  ii the difficulty of estimating our revenues on a percentage of completion method and iii our use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements 
service sales 
in addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above  our service sales include customer support contracts and consulting services 
on our balance sheet  deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we have not yet performed the applicable services 
customer support contracts 
we sell service contracts to most of our customers 
these contracts are support service agreements 
we have an internal support desk that provides integrated customer support services  including configuration and usage assistance  technical advice and prompt incident detection and resolution 
our technical staff first assists a customer in identifying the source of system problems and in determining whether there is defective hardware or software 
if our customer requires on site maintenance or repair services  we arrange for a service call pursuant to underlying third party support service agreements we have with our hardware and software vendors 
when we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement  we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element 
in all cases  we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
we are contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor  or its designee  fails to perform according to the terms of its contact 
consulting services 
some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing storage architectures and offer our recommendations 
other customers engage us to assist them on site with extended data storage projects  to support their data storage environments and to help with long term data storage design challenges 
for these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products  we recognize revenues as we perform these services 
gross reporting of revenues 
we report our revenues from the sale of hardware and software products on a gross  rather than a net  basis 
in reporting our revenues on a gross basis  we considered that we are the primary obligor to our customers 
we are responsible for fulfillment  including the acceptability of the products and services to our customers 
we have the risk of loss for inventory and credit 
we establish the prices for our products and services with our customers 
we are responsible for the installation and configuration services ordered by our customers 
commission expense 
we utilize a direct sales force to generate virtually all of our revenues 
we pay our sales people a combination of base salary and commissions 
we pay commissions based on the amount of gross profit generated from the products and services sold 
we match commissions to the appropriate transactions and recognize commission expense at the time we recognize the related revenues and gross profit 
inventory 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on total market capitalization as compared to the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  it may prompt us to engage a third party valuation firm to perform a valuation of us to further assess whether our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired pursuant to sfas we consider our goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realizable 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make this determination 
as a result of our cumulative losses over the past two years and the full utilization of our loss carry back potential  we have made a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  was million 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
relating to the adoption of sfas r 
sfas r  which will begin to apply in our first quarter of  requires us to recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we are to measure this cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued at the grant date 
the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments is measured initially at fair value and re measured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products and services in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
