item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under item of this report 
overview the company currently operates as a community oriented financial institution that accepts deposits from the general public in the communities surrounding its full service banking centers and loan production offices 
the deposited funds  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  are used by the company to originate loans 
the company s principal lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans for the purchase or refinancing of one to four family residential properties 
the company also originates commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  commercial loans  automobile loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and a variety of other consumer loans 
this was a year of significant investment by the company in its core infrastructure 
to position itself for further growth  the company opened five additional branch and loan production offices during which has allowed the company to further expand into macomb and lapeer counties 
this expansion  along with an aggressive pricing strategy on both the loan and deposit side  has led to significant growth in both loans and deposits and resulted in an overall increase in the bank s market share 
nonetheless  the current interest rate environment coupled with our aggressive pricing strategy continues to contribute to further compression in the company s net interest margin 
the company also made other significant investments in core infrastructure this year  including successfully integrating the operations of metrobank and citizens first savings bank under the charter of the latter 
this process was undertaken to enhance productivity and increase the company s overall profitability 
in addition  the company is currently in the process of discontinuing the outsourcing of its item processing and core system to a third party service provider 
the company expects that the financial investment necessary to bring this function in house will lead to cost savings going forward 
finally  the year also reflects the company s first full year of operation under the mandates of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management to develop and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and to issue a report on its assessment 
as with all other publicly traded companies  establishing these procedures was costly and time consuming 
however  the company expects its fees for professional services related to compliance with section of the act to level off on a going forward basis 
critical accounting policies management has established various accounting policies that govern how accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america are used to prepare the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and as to which different estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly as a result of these estimates and assumptions  and different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations for future reporting periods 
management believes that the company s critical accounting policies relate to the company s securities  allowance for loan losses  its valuation of its mortgage servicing rights and goodwill and intangibles 
these policies are described in more detail below 
securities 
securities are evaluated to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
management and the asset liability committee systematically evaluate securities for other than temporary declines in market value on a quarterly basis 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  trends of the respective indices  historical rate patterns and their relation to the expected rates  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable 
once a decline in value below amortized cost is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced to its fair value  forming a new cost basis for the investment  and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
allowance for loan losses 
the company recognizes that losses will be experienced from originating loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other factors  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
to reflect the perceived risk associated with the company s loan portfolio  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb potential losses from loans in its loan portfolio 
as losses are estimated to have occurred  management establishes a provision for loan losses  which is charged directly against earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is assured 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses based on information as of the date of the financial statements 
management evaluates whether the company s loan loss allowance is adequate at least quarterly by assessing the expected losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
management first reviews perceived higher risk loans  such as commercial and multi 
table of contents family real estate loans and loans with significant balances  and establishes an allowance for those loans 
second  management reviews loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk  including impaired  or likely uncollectible loans  and loans that have been classified as watch list loans  and attributes a specified loan loss allowance to these reviewed loans 
for additional information regarding how management determines whether a loan is impaired  or likely uncollectible  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
third  an appropriate level of loan loss is then determined for the remaining balance of the loan portfolio by applying varying loan loss factors 
management then analyzes whether the combined loan loss allowance is adequate by considering other factors that may have an impact on the performance of the loan portfolio  such as trends in real estate and collateral values  and adjusts the overall loan loss allowance if appropriate 
no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will be unnecessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses or if historical trends change 
nevertheless  management believes that  based on information currently available  the company s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time 
in addition  it is uncertain whether various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process and in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will request that the company increase its allowance for loan losses 
the company believes  however  that it has established its existing loan loss allowance in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these agencies could  nevertheless  require the company to provide additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon judgments of the agencies that are different from the judgments of management 
in the last few years  the percentage of the loan loss allowance to total loans has decreased 
the company reviews the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and establishes a provision based on actual and estimated losses inherent in the portfolio 
because the estimates and assumptions underlying the company s allowance for loan losses are inherently uncertain  different estimates and assumptions could require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and results of operations 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the company routinely sells its originated residential mortgage loans to investors  mainly freddie mac and fannie mae 
although the company sells the mortgage loans  it frequently retains the servicing rights  or the rights to collect payments and otherwise service these loans  for an administrative or servicing fee 
the mortgage loans that the company services for others are not included as assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
loans serviced for others were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the company 
this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights 
there are a number of factors  however  that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company  including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the loan 
for example  if the mortgage loan is prepaid  the company will receive fewer servicing fees  meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the company s balance sheet 
therefore  in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the company of the mortgage servicing rights  the company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party 
the independent third party s valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company s loan servicing portfolio  such as loan terms  interest rates and recent prepayment experience  as well as current market interest rate levels  market forecasts and other economic conditions 
based upon the independent third party s valuation of the company s mortgage servicing rights  management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata  if necessary  to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company 
the estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain  and different estimates could have a material impact on the company s net income and results of operations 
the valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions 
the balances of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights  net of valuation allowance  included in the company s other assets at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the fair values of the company s mortgage servicing rights were determined using annual constant prepayment speeds of and and discount rates of and at december  and december   respectively 
constant prepayment speeds are a statistical measure of the historical or expected prepayment of principal on a mortgage 
different estimates of the prepayment speeds and discount rates or different assumptions could have a material impact on the value of the mortgage servicing rights and  therefore  on the company s valuation allowance 
for further discussion of the company s valuation allowance and valuation of mortgage servicing 
table of contents rights  including a table setting forth the valuation allowances established by management with regard to the company s mortgage servicing rights for the previous three periods  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
as can be seen in that table  prepayments have decreased and discount rates have increased over the past twelve months 
as a result of the combined effect of these conditions  the estimated fair value of the company s mortgage servicing rights has increased 
goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets arising from business acquisitions represent the value attributable to identifiable core deposits and unidentifiable goodwill intangible elements in the business acquired 
the fair value of goodwill and intangibles is dependent upon many factors  including the company s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other financial institutions 
a decline in earnings as a result of business or market conditions  a lack of growth or the company s inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill and intangibles which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
the annual test of goodwill impairment is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the company to the book value of the company 
if the book value is in excess of the fair value  impairment is indicated and the goodwill must be written down to its fair value 
for a further discussion of the company s goodwill and intangibles  refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets 
total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily due to a million  or  increase in loans  which is explained in more detail below  a million  or  increase in premises and equipment  due to the purchase of land for future branch expansion in the company s market area  the remodeling of the company s main office and additional capital improvements as a result of remodeling of our other branches  and additional banking centers  a million  or  increase in cash and equivalents due to timing differences  and a million  or  increase in federal home loan bank fhlb stock  due to increased borrowings from the fhlb which  in turn  required an increased investment in fhlb stock 
the increases in assets at december   as compared to assets at december   described above were partially offset by a decrease in securities available for sale of approximately million  or  due to maturities of investments and using the cash flow of these maturities to pay off federal funds borrowed 
the company s net loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   as a result of the million increase in loans referred to above 
the increase in loans was a result of the company s operating strategy of controlled balance sheet growth and consisted primarily of a million  or  increase in commercial real estate loans to million  a million  or  increase in commercial loans to million  a million  or  increase in construction loans to million  a million  or  increase in home equity loans and lines of credit to million  and a million  or a  increase in consumer loans to million primarily in vehicles loans 
the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the development of new business relationships in the new markets where we have concentrated our growth efforts and growth of existing clients 
the increase in consumer loans was a result of ongoing efforts to emphasize growth in shorter term commercial and consumer loan products 
additionally  we added several experienced mortgage loan officers during which had an accretive and immediate impact on the mortgage loan portfolio in the form of home equity lines of credit and construction loans 
we expect the balances in these types of loans to increase during  however  to a much lesser extent given the current rising interest rate environment 
total liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the following 
table of contents a million  or  increase in deposits from million at december  to million at december   and a million  or  increase in borrowed funds to fund loan growth which primarily consisted of a million  or  increase in fhlb advances from million at december  to million at december   partially offset by a net decrease of million  or  in the bank line of credit 
the overall increase in deposits was primarily invested in loans 
the increase in deposits was a result of the company s greater emphasis on building additional relationships with new and existing customers and revisiting our competitive pricing structure on a regional basis 
during  we increased our rates offered on deposits based on several modeling analyses and overall interest rate market 
while our deposits have grown during  we expected continued intense competition for deposit share in our markets 
as part of our strategic plan  we believe we have a tremendous amount of opportunity to increase the number of products per household  which improved from to at december  and december   respectively 
the million increase in deposits at december  compared to december  was primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in noninterest bearing deposits  a million  or  increase in money market accounts  and a million  or  increase in certificates of deposit  of which million related to brokered deposits 
the increases in the certificates of deposit accounts were primarily due to lower overall rates in short term accounts 
the growth in noninterest bearing deposits and money market accounts was partially due to growth in business deposit accounts as part of our ongoing effort to attract and retain deposit relationships with businesses throughout our market areas 
the increase in deposits at december   as compared to at december   was partially offset by a decrease in now checking accounts of million  or  primarily due to customers transferring deposits to higher earning certificates of deposits 
quality of assets 
nonperforming loans were of total loans at december   compared to at december  nonperforming loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  approximately of the total increase in nonperforming loans was due to the overall general growth of the portfolio  in addition to commercial loans which  primarily represents three commercial loan relationships that were previously considered watch credits by management at december  these three loan relationships have either deteriorated or have been placed under forbearance agreements by management 
additionally  the increase in nonperforming real estate and consumer loans were partially attributable to general poor economic conditions in the state of michigan including a statewide unemployment rate that is higher than the national average  loans that deteriorated during the course of and our change in policy in regards to the criteria necessary to classify a loan as performing or nonperforming as previously discussed above in item  under the section nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
the company believes that the collateral attached to these relationships is adequate or that specific reserves have been allocated to cover any potential impairment 
see the loans section of note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report for more information 
nonperforming assets  which includes nonperforming loans and real estate and other assets owned by the company after foreclosure  increased million  or  to million  or  of total assets  at december   as compared to million  or  of total assets at december  this increase in nonperforming assets was due to the increase in nonperforming loans as described above along with a nominal  increase in other real estate owned 
the allowance for loan losses remained constant at million at december  and december   or  of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december  during  we took a proactive and aggressive approach in addressing delinquent loans and enhanced monitoring systems to ensure that the company maintains asset quality to the highest levels 
additionally  the bankruptcy laws changed during the last quarter of  and similar to other financial institutions  the company experienced an increase in nonperforming loans and charge offs in as such  net charge offs increased from  to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the company s allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
use of a different amount for the allowance could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
for more information on how the amount of this allowance is determined  please see the caption critical accounting policies in this section 

table of contents stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december   as a result of net income of million  a  increase in unearned compensation for esop and a  increase in deferred compensation which represents deferred fees owed to members of the board of directors 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in treasury shares and a  or  increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss from the net unrealized gains or losses on securities

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
the increase in net income for was primarily due to a million  or increase in net interest income  after provision for loan losses and a million  or  increase in noninterest income 
the increase in net income was offset by an increase of million  or  increase in noninterest expenses  which was primarily due to a million  or  increase in compensation and employee benefits 
these increases and decreases are explained in more detail below 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to prime rate increases  or basis points  between december  and december  as such  total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the current rising interest rate environment generated higher yields in both loans and investments 
however our growth in loans  primarily commercial loans  contributed to the rise in interest income 
the increase in interest income was offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense  primarily due to our increased reliance on the fhlb and our correspondent banks federal fund borrowing lines 
similarly to  our loan growth surpassed our growth in deposits during and therefore  as anticipated  our borrowings increased to fund this loan growth 
we expect this trend to continue throughout based on our expectations of growth and the highly competitive market in which the company operates or anticipates to operate 
interest expense on deposits increased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
a majority of this increase was in money market deposits and certificate of deposit 
as we continue to move into new markets to expand our market share  we expect interest expense on deposits to increase during  as experienced during the year ended december  the company is entering highly competitive markets  however  based on management s analysis  we believe that these markets provide greater and more lucrative opportunities within which to execute our strategic plan 
we believe the macomb  lapeer and oakland county markets are experiencing positive economic growth based on our information gathered during our due diligence and analysis of census data 
our net interest margin fell by basis points from to from december  to december   respectively 
as such  in a rising interest rate environment  we expect our net interest margin to remain flat or increase incrementally during provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased provision for loan losses is a result of our analysis of the allowance for loan losses  loan growth experienced during and the increase in nonperforming loans during despite the increased provision  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased from at december  to at december   in each case primarily as a result of the significant increase in the size and growth of the company s loan portfolio 
see item under the quality of assets section for additional discussion relating to the provision for loan losses 
management expects  based on our strategic plan  that the provision for loan losses during will increase by approximately  if not more  than the increase experienced during noninterest income 
as discussed in previous sec quarterly and annual reports  the company s noninterest income is an area that continues to be on the forefront of management discussion and efforts to improve are constantly reviewed 
this is an area that  compared to our peers  provides a tremendous opportunity for growth 
however  it is recognized by management that exemplary execution is vital to our success 
several initiatives were implemented during in an effort to increase this source of income 
service charges and other fees remained relatively flat  however  mortgage banking activities increased million  or  from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
included in this increase was the sale of approximately million of mortgage loans which resulted in a gain before taxes of approximately  trust fee income increased by  or  from  to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in noninterest income was offset by reduced gains on sale of securities compared to as the company sold only one security at par during the first quarter of noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of million  or  in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  due primarily to full and part time employees added during to significantly increase the level of customer service and to accommodate the expansion of our branch and loan production office network 
given the rise in health care costs  growth expected to be achieved in the future  and the costs of securing experienced personnel  we expect these expenses to continue to increase in the future 
we have invested significantly in experienced personnel to generate various efficiencies and to obtain our overall growth that we experienced in we expect these investments in personnel to continue to add value to our business model 

table of contents in addition to the increase in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  office occupancy and equipment increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to additional branches and additional loan production offices  as rent expense increased during the company also renovated three floors of the main office to make them more conducive to a sales and service environment 
contributing to the increase in noninterest expense was an increase of  or  in professional fees primarily due to compliance with the various requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  an increase of  or  in data processing expense primarily related to our successful conversion of the core systems of metrobank  and an increase of million  or  in other noninterest expenses  of which approximately  related to conversion of metrobank 
the increase in noninterest expense was partially offset by a decrease of  or  in advertising expenses 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  from million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
included in federal income taxes at december  is a reserve for the realization of a portion of the company s contribution carry forward for tax purposes  which expires in fiscal realization of this contribution carry forward is based on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the carry forwards expiration 
management has determined  based on projected taxable income levels through  that the entire amount of the carry forward is not expected to be used 
therefore  during  management recorded  as an addition to the valuation allowance for a total of  as of december  because it is more likely than not that the full contribution carry forward will not be utilized prior to its expiration 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
the decrease in net income for the year was primarily due to a million  or  increase in interest expense  a million  or  decrease in noninterest income primarily due to a million  or  decrease in income from mortgage banking activities due to the dropoff of refinancing of residential mortgage loans  combined with a million  or  increase in noninterest expenses  which was primarily due to a million  or  increase in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses and a million  or  increase in occupancy expenses 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase consisted primarily of a million  or  increase in total interest income to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  primarily due to the addition of million of loans from metrobank that provided million in interest income offset by a basis point reduction in average yields on loans 
the increase in total interest income was offset by a million  or  increase in total interest expense to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a  or  aggregate increase in interest expense on savings  now and money market deposit accounts and a million  or  increase in interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in average interest rates on fhlb advances 
earning asset yields have declined by approximately basis points over the last year 
net interest margin continues to compress as existing loans refinance and new loans  mainly commercial and consumer  that are indexed to prime were added to the portfolio 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased provision for loan losses is the result of a million increase in nonperforming loans due to a change in policy and the  or  increase in net charge offs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the increase in nonperforming loans and net charge offs  management felt an increased provision was warranted 
despite the increased provision  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased from at december  to at december   in each case primarily as a result of the significant increase in the size of the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  metrobank provided a total of  or  of the 
table of contents total in noninterest income 
the overall decrease was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in mortgage banking activities  due to decreased sales of fixed rate one to four family loans and a one time charge of approximately  in the first quarter to the custodial account for the servicing of loans sold to freddie mac 
as discussed in the form k for the year ended december  and as expected by management  the volume of refinancing of mortgage loans significantly decreased due to the economic conditions experienced during mortgage banking activities were effected due to the prime rate increase of basis points from december  to december  additionally  service charges and other fees decreased  or  primarily due to strategic pricing of our products in efforts to increase our customer base 
the decrease in noninterest income was offset by an increase in gains on sales of investment securities of  from a  loss for the year ended december  to a  gain for the year ended december  the company took advantage of the increased market values of various investments and used the proceeds to fund higher interest earning assets  in this case loans 
while noninterest income showed significant decreases during the period  much of the decrease was due to the large reduction of refinancings and subsequent sales of long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   of which metrobank contributed million  or  of total noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased primarily due to the an increase of million  or  in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  due primarily to million additional expenses for staff acquired in the metrobank transaction 
occupancy and equipment expense increased million  or  due partially to additional branches and million in additional expenses for metrobank 
advertising and business promotion expense increased  or  due to increased advertising efforts in association with the metrobank acquisition 
professional fees increased million  or  due to increased costs associated with being a public company  including compliance costs associated with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and charges for compliance with section data processing increased  or  primarily due to a full year of using fiserv as our core processor 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
included in federal income taxes at december  is a reserve for the realization of a portion of the company s contribution carry forward for tax purposes  which expires in fiscal realization of this contribution carry forward is based on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the carry forwards expiration 
during  management determined  based on projected taxable income levels through  that the entire amount of the carry forward is not expected to be used 
therefore  management recorded a  valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the full contribution carry forward will not be utilized prior to its expiration 
liquidity and capital resources general 
based on the following  the company considers its liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet its outstanding short term and long term needs 
liquidity is the company s ability to meet its current and future needs for cash 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to have funds available  without incurring excessive cost  to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to satisfy its financial commitments  as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
many factors affect a company s ability to meet its liquidity needs  including variation in the markets served  the company s asset liability mix  its reputation and credit standing in the market and general economic conditions 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposits  loan repayments  payments of interest on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the fhlb or correspondent banks  cash on hand and cash on deposit 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments  and mortgage loan originations and sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
additionally  dividends from the bank may be a source of funding for the company 
the bank is subject to regulatory requirements regarding these dividends

new accounting standards 
there were several new accounting standards which were issued or became effective in  in addition to some which have later effective dates 
those that are applicable to the company are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
effect of inflation and changing prices 
the company s consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations  increased loan amounts and increased interest rates which must include a real rate of return and an additional amount to reflect expected inflation over the term of the loan 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
sudden fluctuations in market interest rates are inherently uncertain and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company to the extent that the interest rates on assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
for example  the company s assets include a large number of fixed rate mortgage loans 
as a result  during periods of rising interest rates  there is a risk that the company s interest expense will increase faster than its interest income 
the company s principal objectives regarding interest rate risk management are to evaluate regularly the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  to determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s financial condition and outlook  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage interest rate risk consistent with the company s board of directors approved guidelines 
the company has an asset liability management committee that is responsible for accomplishing the principal objectives of interest rate risk management 
the committee regularly reviews the company s guidelines and strategies affecting the company s asset liability management related activities to determine if they are adequate based on estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits set by the company s board and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the committee is composed of members of management and the company s board of directors and regularly meets to review the company s asset liability mix 
it also reports trends  interest rate risk position and results of current interest rate risk management strategies and recommends any changes to strategies to the board of directors quarterly 
in recent years  the company has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and the sale of longer term  fixed rate loans  emphasizing shorter term consumer loans  maintaining a high quality portfolio of short to intermediate term securities  maintaining high levels of liquidity  and using fhlb advances and other borrowings to better structure the maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
adverse market interest rate changes between the time that a customer receives a rate lock commitment on a mortgage and when the fully funded mortgage loan is sold to an investor can erode the value of that mortgage 
the company enters into forward sales 
table of contents contracts in order to mitigate this particular interest rate risk 
the company accepts credit risk in forward sales contracts should the other party default  in which case the company would be compelled to sell the mortgages to another party at the current market price 
therefore  if market interest rates increased from the date of the forward sales contract and the other party defaulted  the company would most likely have to sell the mortgage to another party at a lower price  which would reduce earnings or create losses on this mortgage 
more recently  the company has used some of its excess liquidity to increase its loan portfolios 
as liquidity is reduced  the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expected to increase 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model based on discounted cash flows to measure the potential impact on its net interest income of hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
the model forecasts the company s net interest income for the next year assuming that there are no changes in interest rates or the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet from the end of the prior period 
after this initial forecast  the model subjects the balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes of and basis points to the treasury yield curve 
in order to determine the possible effect of the rate changes  the model uses various assumptions 
among others  these assumptions relate to the following the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of and pricing decisions regarding loans based on previous rates charged by the company  changes in deposits and borrowings based on previous rates charged by the company and other competitive conditions  reinvestments of cash flows from assets and liabilities based on current market interest rates  the lack of any changes in the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates based on particular characteristics of those assets and liabilities  expected prepayment rates on loans and investments based on industry standards and the current interest rate environment  certificates of deposit and other deposit flows based on expected maturity dates  and expected growth based on the company s projections 
the table below sets forth  as of december   estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in the company s net interest income for the next twelve month period that could occur as a result of instantaneous changes in market interest rates of and basis points estimated change in annual net interest income increase decrease in market interest at december  dollars in thousands rates in basis points rate shock amount change change static  the above table indicates that in the event of a sudden and sustained decline in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to decrease 
as noted above  computation of the prospective effect of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on a number of assumptions 
the calculation of the interest rate sensitivity of the company could vary significantly if different assumptions were used  or if the company s response to changes in interest rates included changes in the mix of assets and liabilities in its balance sheet 
other shortcomings also exist in the table 
these shortcomings include the following  among others although certain assets may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate and residential mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of repayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 

table of contents if interest rates increased  it is also possible that the increased mortgage payments required of certain borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the company s lending operations 
as a result of these and other shortcomings in the model determining the prospective effects of interest rate changes  the computations in the table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in market interest rates 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake to respond to changes in interest rates 
forward sales contracts as of december  have settlement dates of less than days 
the weighted average settlement interest rate for these contracts was
