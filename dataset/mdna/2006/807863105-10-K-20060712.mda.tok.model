item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
background we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  services and ideas that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
we have grown in recent years through acquisitions and internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were billion  which represented a compound annual revenue growth  including acquisitions  of compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was due to an increase in our offering of proprietary products and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have more proprietary products in their offerings and consequently higher gross margins than our essentials businesses 
the specialty businesses have also experienced higher revenue growth than the essentials businesses  resulting in a product mix with higher gross margins 
in addition  our growth has increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
further  through the vertical acquisitions of school specialty publishing and califone  we have acquired suppliers and have thereby captured the suppliers margins 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross margin is the direct sourcing of product through overseas channels 
our historical operating profit and margins have been substantially impacted by the timing of our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses 
in fiscal  our operating profit and margin were million and  respectively 
in fiscal  our operating income and margin were million and  respectively 
during fiscal we recorded million in impairment charges related to our visual media business unit 
on august   we acquired delta education  a seasonal business that resulted in the inclusion of their operating losses in our financial results from september through april thereby reducing our fiscal operating profit and margin 
further  we incurred integration expenses related to integrating the business and consolidation of existing operations into delta s operations 
fiscal s operating profit also included million in expenses related to a terminated merger transaction 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisitions of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating and net income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which were the premier agendas acquisition in fiscal and the delta education acquisition in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on a historical basis concerning our results of operations for the fiscal years  and fiscal year revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment charge merger related expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense redemption costs and fees for convertible debt redemption income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income consolidated historical results of operations fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks overview of fiscal on august   the company acquired delta education  llc delta for an aggregate purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
the business operates from nashua  new hampshire and is the exclusive publisher of inquiry based hands on science curriculum for the elementary school market developed by the university of california  berkeley 
its products include comprehensive science kits  books  instructional materials and education software 
this business was merged with our existing science business  frey scientific 
as part of the transaction  we also acquired delta s educators publishing service division  a supplemental publisher of reading titles for grades k which integrated into our existing publishing business 
the results of this acquisition have been included in the specialty segment since the date of acquisition 
revenues for fiscal increased to billion as compared to billion in fiscal the revenue growth was driven by the acquisition of delta  partially offset by the impact of an extra week of revenues in fiscal and a modest decline in revenues in both segments 
we believe the modest decline in revenues was the result of schools unexpectedly increasing their expenditures on fuel and health related costs  which conversely reduced funds available and consequently their spending on supplemental education products and equipment 
we continued to drive our product mix to higher margin proprietary products  with the specialty segment representing of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this shift in product mix to higher margin specialty products expanded gross margins to from

revenues revenues increased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal the growth in revenues was attributable to revenues from acquired businesses  partially offset by an extra week of revenues in fiscal and a modest decline in revenues of the non acquired businesses in both segments 
specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues 
the increase in specialty segment revenues was primarily due to acquisitions  partially offset by fiscal including an extra week and a modest decline in some specialty businesses 
essentials segment revenues decreased from million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues 
the decline in essentials segment revenues was primarily the result of fiscal including an extra week  the sale of audio graphic systems and a modest decline in revenues from consumable products 
gross profit gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margins mainly related to a shift in revenues to the higher gross margin specialty segment and a decrease in product costs through the direct sourcing of product from overseas channels 
gross margin improved basis points to of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in sales of higher margin proprietary products by the specialty segment as a percentage of overall sales mix  reduced costs of products associated with our global sourcing initiative and price expansion in the essentials segment  particularly in the furniture lines 
specialty segment gross profit increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in specialty segment gross profit was due to the aforementioned increased revenues and gross margin improvement 
the basis point improvement in gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily driven by acquired businesses  which have a higher gross margin than the average gross margin of our existing specialty segment businesses

partially offsetting these increases is a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs as a percent of revenues 
the cost reductions have been achieved through improved operational efficiencies

the amount outstanding as of april  in revolving and incremental term loans under the credit facility was million and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
during fiscal  we borrowed under our credit facility primarily to fund the acquisition of delta and to meet seasonal working capital requirements 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital requirements of our peak selling season 
as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately  which excludes amortization of loan origination fee costs and the commitment fees on unborrowed funds

the company is permitted to satisfy the portion of the conversion obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount  if any  in either cash or shares of common stock 
the convertible subordinated notes became convertible during the second quarter of fiscal as the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded for the specified amount of time 
as a result  holders of the notes may surrender the notes for conversion at any time from october  until july  the notes are recorded as a current liability 
holders that exercise their right to convert the notes will receive up to the accreted principal amount in cash  with the balance of the conversion obligation  if any  to be satisfied in shares of company common stock or cash  at the company s discretion

the leases expire in november the amount outstanding as of april  under the agreements was million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million increase in operating cash flows was primarily related to a decrease in accounts receivable driven by accelerated collections and an increase in accounts payable associated with a build of inventory in april to prepare for the heavy shipping season 
net cash used in investing activities increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily related to fluctuations in cash paid for acquisitions 
cash paid for acquisitions increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cash paid in acquisitions in fiscal represents the purchase of the guidance channel 
cash paid in acquisitions in fiscal primarily relates to the acquisition of delta 
cash flows from financing activities increased million from million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal to million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to borrowings to fund the delta acquisition 
during fiscal  we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes which were redeemed at a premium of million during the second quarter of fiscal on june  we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  which allows us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
common stock acquired through the share repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures and our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately to million and to consist primarily of computer hardware and software costs related to continued implementation of our new business systems and warehouse equipment costs 
we expect our investment in product development to be approximately to million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility was amended on february  to extend its expiration to january  and it may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
in addition  the facility was amended to permit advances up to million from july through november of each year  and advances up to million from december through june of each year 
we entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing our variable rate interest expense 
at april   million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
these costs are included in other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of april  payments due in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations convertible subordinated notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations debt obligations includes principal and interest payments on our credit facility and sale leaseback obligations  and assumes these obligations remain outstanding until maturity at current or contractually defined interest rates 
convertible subordinated notes are recorded as a current liability at april  during fiscal the notes became convertible and may be surrendered for conversion at any time 
the amount reflected includes principal and accrued interest as of the balance sheet date 
if the notes are held to maturity in  our obligation  including interest at current rates and accreted principal  is million 
as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
the short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted on august   we acquired delta education  a seasonal business that generated operating and net losses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million pre tax impairment charge related to our visual medial business unit 
inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book  video or other media  on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in net development costs on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with our publishing  science and visual media businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized to expense million related to development costs 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
during fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge related to product development costs at our visual media business unit 
goodwill and intangible assets  and long lived assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
determining the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a million partial goodwill impairment charge related to our visual media business unit 
the impairment was the result of deteriorating financial performance  particularly in the teacher s media offering 
school specialty visual media has remaining goodwill and intangible asset values of million and million  respectively 
if the business unit does not perform as expected  it is possible that additional impairments to goodwill and intangible assets could occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would have decreased by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
