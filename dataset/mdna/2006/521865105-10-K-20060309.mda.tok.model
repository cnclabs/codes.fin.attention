as a result of our strong customer relationships  strategic alliances and full service capabilities  we are well positioned to expand our business with asian automotive manufacturers  both in asia and elsewhere 
improve european business structure and expand european market share of our seating and electronic and electrical segments 
in europe  the automotive market remains relatively fragmented with significant overcapacity  making europe a difficult market for automotive manufacturers and suppliers alike 
we are continuing to improve our financial results in europe by focusing significant new product initiatives on seating and electronics  where there are opportunities for significant scale and we have a strong competitive position 
we have also improved our overall business structure in europe by consolidating administrative functions and reducing manufacturing costs through the relocation and expansion of component production in countries with lower labor costs 
leverage electronic capabilities and invest in product technology 
consumers are demanding more in their automotive interiors  focusing on convenience  communication and safety  and automotive manufacturers view the vehicle interior as a major selling point to their customers 
because electronic products and electrical distribution systems are an important part of automotive interior systems  we seek to take advantage of our capabilities in these areas to develop new products that respond to customer and consumer demands 
we will also continue to make targeted investments in technology to support our existing products  
table of contents as well as our new product development efforts 
the focus of our research and development efforts is to identify new interior features that make vehicles safer  more comfortable and more attractive to consumers 
to further these efforts  we conduct extensive analysis and testing of consumer responses to automotive interior styling and innovations 
we also have state of the art acoustics testing and instrumentation and data analysis capabilities 
we maintain six advanced technology centers and several customer focused product engineering centers where we design and develop new products and conduct extensive product testing 
in addition  our advanced technology center in southfield  michigan  demonstrates our ability to integrate engineering  research  design  development and validation testing capabilities at one location 
maintain an efficient cost structure 
an efficient cost structure is necessary to withstand fluctuations in industry demand over time  as well as changing competitive and macroeconomic conditions 
our relatively variable cost structure is maintained  in part  through ongoing productivity initiatives throughout the organization  as well as initiatives to promote and enhance the sharing of technology  engineering  purchasing and capital investments across customer platforms 
in this regard  we are working to leverage our scale and interior expertise to develop common vehicle architecture to reduce the complexity and variety of substructures that are not seen by consumers 
one example is the lear flexible seat architecture  a modular system that incorporates many desired comfort and required safety features utilizing validated common components that can be packaged in multiple seat systems 
the advantage is reduced design  engineering and development costs to deliver an enhanced end product with improved quality and craftsmanship 
we also have a global sourcing strategy designed to increase our competitiveness from both a manufacturing and sourcing standpoint 
more than eighty of our facilities are currently located in low cost countries  including mexico  hungary  poland  china  south africa  the philippines  honduras  the czech republic  slovakia  turkey  romania  morocco and tunisia 
we have also joined our customers to proactively reduce costs and eliminate waste by establishing cost technology optimization centers in the united states  germany  spain  the philippines and brazil 
our cost technology optimization centers provide a venue where our engineers can work with our customers to identify and address cost discrepancies among similar products and inconsistencies in features among vehicles in similar segments 
product line focus 
in response to the recent industry trend away from total interior integration  we are taking a more product focused approach to managing our business 
in our seating and electronic and electrical segments  we are seeking growth by penetrating new markets and new customers  as well as through selective vertical integration 
in our electronic and electrical segment  our acquisition of terminals and connectors capabilities in europe allows us to provide electrical distribution systems at lower costs to our customers 
in our seating segment  we are focused on expanding our capabilities in structural components and selected trim products 
with respect to our interior segment  we are actively implementing restructuring actions to improve our cost structure and capacity utilization while simultaneously evaluating strategic alternatives 
in this regard  we entered into a framework agreement relating to a proposed joint venture relationship with wl ross co 
llc and franklin mutual advisers  llc on october  we would hold a non controlling interest in the new joint venture that would explore acquisition opportunities in the automotive interior components sector  including a possible acquisition of all or a portion of collins aikman corporation 
the proposed joint venture would involve all or a portion of our interior segment  but not our seating or electronic and electrical segments 
establishment of the proposed joint venture is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and other conditions 
in the event that we fail to achieve resolution on various matters in such negotiations  we will continue to explore other strategic alternatives with respect to this segment 
no assurances can be given that the proposed joint venture will be completed on the terms contemplated or at all 
products we conduct our business in three product operating segments seating  interior  and electronic and electrical 
the seating segment includes seat systems and the components thereof 
the interior segment includes instrument panels and cockpit systems  headliners and overhead systems  door panels  flooring and acoustic systems and other interior products 
the electronic and electrical segment includes electronic products and electrical distribution 
table of contents systems  primarily wire harnesses and junction boxes  interior control and entertainment systems  and wireless systems 
net sales by product segment as a percentage of total net sales is shown below for the year ended december  seating interior electronic and electrical for further information related to our reportable operating segments  see note  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
seating 
the seating segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of vehicle seating requirements 
seat systems typically represent to of the total cost of an automotive interior 
we produce seat systems for automobiles and light trucks that are fully assembled and ready for installation 
in most cases  seat systems are designed and engineered for specific vehicle models or platforms 
we have recently developed lear flexible seat architecture  whereby we can assist our customers in achieving a faster time to market by building a program specific seat incorporating the latest performance requirements and safety technology in a shorter period of time 
seat systems are designed to achieve maximum passenger comfort by adding a wide range of manual and power features  such as lumbar supports  cushion and back bolsters and leg supports 
as a result of our strong product design and product technology  we are a leader in designing seats with enhanced safety and convenience features 
for example  our protec tm plus self aligning head restraint is an advancement in seat passive safety features 
by integrating the head restraint with the lumbar support  the occupant s head is provided support earlier and for a longer period of time in a rear impact collision  potentially reducing the risk of injury 
in addition  we have developed occusense  a seat technology which detects the size and weight of an occupant to control airbag deployment 
we also supply a patented integrated restraint seat system that uses an ultra high strength steel tower and a split frame design to improve occupant comfort and convenience  as well as a high performance climate system for seat cooling and moisture removal 
to address the increasing focus on craftsmanship  we have developed concave seat contours that eliminate wrinkles and provide improved styling 
we are also satisfying the growing customer demand for reconfigurable seats with our thin profile rear seat and our stadium slide seat system 
for example  general motors full size sport utility vehicles and light trucks  as well as the ford freestyle  cadillac srx  and dodge durango  use our reconfigurable seating technology  and general motors full size sport utility vehicles  as well as the ford explorer and dodge durango  use our thin profile seating technology for their third row seats 
interior 
the interior segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of interior systems and components 
interior products are designed to provide a harmonious and comfortable interior for vehicle occupants  as well as a variety of functional and safety features 
set forth below is a description of our principal interior products instrument panels and cockpit systems 
the instrument panel is a complex system of coverings and foam  as well as plastic and metal parts designed to house various components and to act as a safety device for the vehicle occupant 
the cockpit system consists of  among other things  the instrument panel trim pad  structural subsystem  electrical distribution system  climate control  driver control pedals  steering controls and driver and passenger safety systems 
specific components of the cockpit system include the instrument cluster gauges  cross car structure  electronic and electrical components  wire harness  audio system  heating  ventilation and air conditioning module  air distribution ducts  air vents  steering column and wheel and glove compartment assemblies 
airbag technologies also continue to be an important component of cockpit systems 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we have introduced cost effective  integrated  seamless airbag covers  which provide greater styling flexibility for the automotive manufacturer 
we believe that future trends in instrument panels and cockpit systems will focus on safety related features 
we have also developed spray pur tm  a seamless polyurethane coating for instrument panels  which eliminates visual seams 
this process is currently being used on several vehicle models  including the cadillac dts and buick lucerne 

table of contents headliners and overhead systems 
overhead systems consist of a headliner  lighting  visors  consoles  wiring and electronics  as well as all other products located in the interior of the vehicle roof 
headliners consist of a substrate  as well as a finished interior layer made of a variety of fabrics and materials 
while headliners are an important contributor to interior aesthetics  they also provide insulation from road noise and can serve as carriers for a variety of other components  such as visors  overhead consoles  grab handles  coat hooks  electrical wiring  speakers  lighting and other electronic and electrical products 
as the amount of electronic and electrical content available in vehicles has increased  headliners have emerged as an important carrier of technology since electronic features ranging from garage door openers to lighting systems are often optimally situated in the headliner 
in addition  headliners provide an important safety function by mitigating the effects of head impact 
we have developed a system that molds the protective foam directly onto the back of the headliner 
this system will be used on several vehicle models that are being launched in door panels 
door panels consist of several component parts  which are attached to a substrate by various methods 
specific components include vinyl or cloth covered appliqu s  armrests  radio speaker grilles  map pocket compartments  carpet and sound reducing insulation 
in addition  door systems often incorporate electronic products and electrical distribution systems  including lock and latch  window glass  window regulators and audio systems  as well as wire harnesses for the control of power seats  windows  mirrors and door locks 
we have recently introduced a two shot molding process that allows a door panel with multiple materials to be produced in a single injection molding machine 
this technology  which results in improved craftsmanship and lower costs  will be used on several vehicle models that are being launched in flooring and acoustic systems 
we have an extensive and comprehensive portfolio of sonotec acoustic products  including flooring systems and dash insulators 
these acoustic products provide noise  vibration and harshness resistance 
carpet flooring systems generally consist of tufted or non woven carpet with a thermoplastic backcoating  which when heated  allows the carpet to be fitted precisely to the interior or trunk compartment of the vehicle 
non carpeted flooring systems  used primarily in commercial and fleet vehicles  offer improved wear and maintenance characteristics 
the dash insulator  mounted onto the firewall  separates the passenger compartment from the engine compartment and is the primary component for preventing engine noise from entering the passenger compartment 
electronic and electrical 
the migration from conventional electrical distribution systems to electronic products and electrical distribution systems is facilitating the integration of wiring and electronic products within the overall electrical architecture of a vehicle 
this migration can reduce the overall system cost and weight and improve reliability and packaging by optimizing the overall system architecture and eliminating a portion of the terminals  connectors and wires normally required for a conventional electrical distribution system 
our umbrella technology  intertronics  reflects our ability to integrate electronic products with automotive interior systems 
this technology is already having an impact on a number of new and next generation products 
for example  our integrated seat adjuster module has two dozen fewer cut circuits and five fewer connectors  weighs a half of a pound less and costs twenty percent less than a traditional separated electronic control unit and seat wiring system 
in addition  our smart junction box expands the traditional junction box functionality by utilizing printed circuit board technologies 
our electronic and electrical products can be grouped into three categories electrical distribution systems 
wire harness assemblies are a collection of terminals  connectors and wires that connect all of the various electronic electrical devices in the vehicle to each other and or to a power source 
terminals and connectors are components of wire harnesses and other electronic electrical devices that connect wire harnesses and electronic electrical devices 
fuse boxes are centrally located boxes in the vehicle that contain fuses and or relays for circuit and device protection  as well as power distribution 
junction boxes serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses 
they may also contain fuses and relays for circuit and device protection 
smart junction boxes are junction boxes with integrated electronic functions  which eliminate interconnections and increase overall system reliability 
certain vehicles may have two or three smart junction boxes linked as a multiplexed buss line 

table of contents interior control and entertainment systems 
the instrument panel center console module provides a control panel for the entertainment system  accessory switch functions  heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
the integrated seat adjuster module combines seat adjustment  power lumbar support  memory function and seat heating into one package 
the integrated door module consolidates the controls for window lift  door lock  power mirror and seat heating and ventilation 
our mechatronic tm lighting control module integrates electronic control logic and diagnostics with the headlamp switch 
entertainment products include sound systems  television modules and the floor  seat or center console mounted mediaconsole with a flip up screen that provides dvd and video game viewing for back seat passengers 
wireless systems 
wireless products send and receive signals using radio frequency technology 
our wireless systems include passive entry systems  dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems and tire pressure monitoring systems 
passive entry systems allow the vehicle operator to unlock the door without using a key or physically activating a remote keyless fob 
dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems allow a single transmitter to perform multiple functions 
for example  our caru tm remote keyless entry system can control and display the status of the vehicle  such as starting the engine  locking and unlocking the doors  opening the trunk and setting the cabin temperature 
in addition  dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems combine remote keyless operations with vehicle immobilizer capability 
our tire pressure monitoring system  known as the lear intellitire tire pressure monitoring system  alerts drivers when a tire has low pressure 
we have received production awards for intellitire from ford for many of their north american vehicles and from hyundai for several models beginning in automotive manufacturers are required to have tire pressure monitoring systems on a portion of new vehicles sold in the united states beginning with model year and on all new vehicles sold in the united states by model year manufacturing a description of the manufacturing processes for each of our operating segments is set forth below 
seating 
our seating facilities generally use just in time manufacturing techniques  and products are delivered to the automotive manufacturers on a just in time basis 
these facilities are typically located near our customers manufacturing and assembly sites 
our seating facilities utilize a variety of methods whereby foam and fabric are affixed to an underlying seat frame 
raw materials used in our seat systems  including steel  aluminum and foam chemicals  are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements 
leather  fabric and certain components are also purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements 
the majority of our steel purchases are comprised of engineered parts that are integrated into a seat system  such as seat frames  mechanisms and mechanical components 
therefore  our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect  through the supply base 
we are increasingly using long term  fixed price supply agreements to purchase key components 
we generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost  quality  delivery  technology or customer support 
interior 
our interior systems process capabilities include injection molding  low pressure injection molding  blow molding  compression molding  rotational molding  urethane foaming and vacuum forming  as well as various trimming and finishing methods 
raw materials  including resin and chemical products  and finished components are assembled into end products and are obtained from multiple suppliers  under supply agreements which typically last for up to one year 
in addition  we produce carpet at one north american plant 
electronic and electrical 
electrical distribution systems are networks of wiring and associated control devices that route electrical power and signals throughout the vehicle 
wire harness assemblies consist of raw  coiled wire  which is automatically cut to length and terminated 
individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table  inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies 
all materials are purchased from suppliers  with the exception of a portion of the terminals and connectors that are produced internally 
certain materials are available from a limited number of suppliers 
supply agreements typically last for up to one year 
the assembly process is labor intensive  and as a result  
table of contents production is generally performed in low cost labor sites in mexico  honduras  the philippines  eastern europe and northern africa 
some of the principal components attached to the wire harness assemblies that we manufacture include junction boxes and electronic control modules 
junction boxes are manufactured in both north america and europe with a proprietary  capital intensive assembly process  using printed circuit boards  a portion of which are purchased from third party suppliers 
proprietary processes have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments  including high temperatures and humidity 
electronic control modules are assembled using high speed surface mount placement equipment in both north america and europe 
while we internally manufacture many of the components that are described above  a substantial portion of these components are furnished by independent  tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
with the recent decline in the automotive production of our key customers and substantial and continuing pressures to reduce costs  certain of our suppliers have experienced  or may experience  financial difficulties 
we seek to carefully manage our supplier relationships to minimize any significant disruptions of our operations 
however  adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers  including certain sole source suppliers  could negatively impact our operating results 
see item a  risk factors adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability 
customers we serve the worldwide automotive and light truck market  which produced over million vehicles in we have automotive interior content on over vehicle nameplates worldwide  and our major automotive manufacturing customers including customers of our non consolidated joint ventures currently include bmw daimlerchrysler dongfeng fiat first autoworks ford gaz general motors honda hyundai isuzu mahindra mahindra mazda mitsubishi porsche psa renault nissan subaru suzuki toyota volkswagen during the year ended december   general motors and ford  two of the largest automotive and light truck manufacturers in the world  together accounted for approximately of our net sales  excluding net sales to saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford 
inclusive of their respective affiliates  general motors and ford accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in in addition  daimlerchrysler accounted for approximately of our net sales in for further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations  see note  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers 
these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model  rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products 
although purchase orders may be terminated at any time by our customers  such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our operating results 
our primary risks are that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model 
in order to reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model  we produce automotive interior systems and components for a broad cross section of both new and established models 
however  larger passenger cars and light trucks typically have more interior content and therefore  tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance 
our net sales for the year ended december   were comprised of the following vehicle categories cars  including mid size  compact  luxury sport and full size  and light truck  including sport utility and pickup and other light truck 

table of contents our agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction 
historically  cost reductions through product design changes  increased productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer imposed productivity cost reduction requirements 
however  in the latter part of and in  unprecedented increases in certain raw material and commodity costs principally steel  resins and other oil based commodities  as well as increases in energy costs had a material adverse impact on our operating results 
while we were able to offset a portion of the adverse impact through aggressive cost reduction actions  relatively high raw material  energy and commodity costs are expected to continue  and no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such customer cost reduction targets in the future 
technology we have the ability to integrate the engineering  research  design  development and validation testing of all automotive interior systems 
advanced technology development is conducted at our six advanced technology centers and at our product engineering centers worldwide

in north america  the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity  fierce competition and significant pension and healthcare liabilities for the domestic automakers 
in europe  the market structure is more fragmented with significant overcapacity  and several of our key platforms have experienced production declines 
general motors and ford  our two largest customers  together accounted for approximately of our net sales in  excluding net sales to saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors and ford 
inclusive of their respective affiliates  general motors and ford accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in north american automotive production by general motors and ford has declined between and  and these two customers have recently announced facility closures and other restructuring actions that will negatively impact future production levels for several of our key platforms 
while we have been aggressively seeking to expand our business with asian automotive manufacturers to offset these declines  no assurances can be given as to how successful we will be in doing so 
as a result  any decline in the automotive production levels of our major customers  particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier  could materially reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
the financial distress of our major customers and within the supply base could harm our profitability 
during  general motors and ford lowered production levels on several of our key platforms in an effort to reduce inventory levels 
in addition  these customers have experienced declining market shares in north america and have recently announced significant restructuring actions in an effort to improve profitability 
the domestic automotive manufacturers are also burdened with substantial structural costs  such as pension and healthcare costs  that have impacted their profitability and labor relations 
several other global automotive manufacturers are also experiencing operating and profitability issues  as well as labor concerns 
in this environment  it is difficult to forecast or assess future customer production schedules  the potential for labor disputes or the success or sustainability of any strategies undertaken by any of our major customers in response to the current industry environment 
in addition  cuts in production schedules are also sometimes announced by our customers with little advance notice  making it difficult to respond with corresponding cost reductions 
our supply base has also been adversely affected by industry conditions 
lower production levels for our key customers and increases in certain raw material  commodity and energy costs have resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base 
several large suppliers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operations 
the continuation of financial distress within the supply base may lead to increased commercial disputes and possible supply chain interruptions 
in addition  the adverse industry environment has required us to provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to ensure uninterrupted production 
while we have taken certain actions to mitigate these factors  we have offset only a portion of their overall impact on our operating results 
the continuation or worsening of these industry conditions would harm our profitability 
the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
although we have purchase orders from many of our customers  these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  renewable on a year to year basis  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
therefore  the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a 
table of contents significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
as a result of our global presence  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries  including countries in asia  eastern and western europe and central and south america 
international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  export and import restrictions  and increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains 
expanding our business in asian markets and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy 
in addition  our strategy includes expanding our european market share and expanding our manufacturing operations in lower cost regions 
as a result  our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability 
higher costs for certain raw materials and commodities  principally steel  resins and other oil based commodities  as well as higher energy costs  had a material adverse impact on our operating results in and will continue to negatively impact our profitability in while we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material  energy and commodity costs  we cannot assure you that such measures will be successful 
in addition  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these cost increases or any future cost increases will not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated 
a significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
most of our employees and a substantial number of the employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements 
virtually all of our unionized facilities in the united states and canada have a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facilities  with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of other collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements covering approximately of our unionized workforce of approximately  employees  including approximately of our unionized workforce in the united states and canada  are scheduled to expire during the current collective bargaining agreements of our three largest customers in the united states expire in a labor dispute involving us or any of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or closure of our customers assembly plants where our products are included in assembled vehicles 
table of contents could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the inability by us or any of our suppliers  our customers or our customers other suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement covering a large number of employees upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also be harmful to our business and our profitability 
adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability 
we obtain components and other products and services from numerous tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
in addition  in some cases  our customers designate our tier ii suppliers and as a result  we do not always have the flexibility or authority to change suppliers 
certain of our suppliers are financially distressed or may become financially distressed 
in addition  an increasing number of our suppliers are located outside of north america or western europe 
any significant disruption in our supplier relationships  including certain relationships with sole source suppliers  could harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant product liability lawsuit  warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers could harm our profitability 
in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims 
in addition  we are a party to warranty sharing and other agreements with our customers related to our products 
these customers may seek contribution or indemnification from us for all or a portion of the costs associated with product liability and warranty claims  recalls or other corrective actions involving our products 
these types of claims could significantly harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 
we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that  from time to time  are significant 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes  including disputes with our suppliers  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 
we depend upon cash from our subsidiaries 
therefore  if we do not receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  it could be more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our revenue and operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of  and dividends and distributions or advances from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations 
we utilize certain cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries to satisfy obligations locally 
our obligations under our primary credit facility and senior notes are currently guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries  but such guarantees may be released under certain circumstances

item legal proceedings commercial disputes we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and claims  including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers and competitors 
largely as a result of generally unfavorable industry conditions and financial distress within the automotive supply base  we experienced an increase in commercial and contractual disputes  particularly with our suppliers 
these disputes vary in nature and are usually resolved by negotiations between the parties 

table of contents on january   seton company seton  one of our leather suppliers  filed a suit alleging that we had breached a purported agreement to purchase leather from seton for seats for the life of the general motors gmt program 
seton filed the lawsuit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan seeking compensatory and exemplary damages totaling approximately million  plus interest  on breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims 
in may  this case proceeded to trial  and the jury returned a million verdict against us 
on september   the court denied our post trial motions challenging the judgment and granted seton s motion to award prejudgment interest in the amount of approximately million 
we are appealing the judgment and the interest award 
on january   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against johnson controls inc and johnson controls interiors llc together  jci in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan alleging that jci s garage door opener products infringed certain of our radio frequency transmitter patents 
jci counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the subject patents are invalid and unenforceable  and that jci is not infringing these patents 
jci also has filed motions for summary judgment asserting that its garage door opener products do not infringe our patents 
we are vigorously pursuing our claims against jci and discovery is on going 
a trial in the case is currently scheduled for the second quarter of after we filed our patent infringement action against jci  affiliates of jci sued one of our vendors and certain of the vendor s employees in ottawa circuit court  michigan  on july   alleging misappropriation of trade secrets 
the suit alleges that the defendants misappropriated and shared with us trade secrets involving jci s universal garage door opener product 
jci seeks to enjoin the defendants from selling or attempting to sell a competing product 
we are not a defendant in this lawsuit  however  the agreements between us and the defendants contain customary indemnification provisions 
we do not believe that our garage door opener product benefited from any allegedly misappropriated trade secrets or technology 
however  jci has sought discovery of certain information which we believe is confidential and proprietary  and we have intervened in the case for the limited purpose of protecting our rights with respect to jci s discovery efforts 
discovery has been extended to july a trial date has not yet been scheduled 
on june   the chamberlain group chamberlain filed a lawsuit against us and ford motor company ford in the northern district of illinois alleging patent infringement 
two counts were asserted against us and ford based upon chamberlain s rolling code security system patent and a related product which operates transmitters to actuate garage door openers 
two additional counts were asserted against ford only not us based upon different chamberlain patents 
the chamberlain lawsuit was filed in connection with the marketing of our universal garage door opener system  which competes with a product offered by jci 
jci obtained technology from chamberlain to operate its product 
in october  jci joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff along with chamberlain  and chamberlain dismissed its infringement claims against ford based upon its rolling security system patent 
jci and chamberlain have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction  which we are contesting 
we are vigorously defending the claims asserted in this lawsuit 
a trial date has not yet been scheduled 
product liability matters in the event that use of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims 
in addition  we are a party to warranty sharing and other agreements with our customers relating to our products 
these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims 
we can provide no assurances that we will not experience material claims in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
in addition  if any of our products are  or are alleged to be  defective  we may be required or requested by our customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products 
certain of our customers have asserted claims against us for costs related to recalls or other corrective actions involving our products 
in certain instances  the allegedly defective products were supplied by tier ii suppliers against whom we have sought or will seek contribution 
we carry insurance for certain legal matters  including product liability claims  but such coverage may be limited 
we do not maintain insurance for product warranty or recall matters 

table of contents environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean up costs resulting from past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on iso to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of ut automotive  inc ut automotive 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation utc in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
utc manages and directly funds these environmental liabilities pursuant to its agreements and indemnities with us 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
one of our subsidiaries and certain predecessor companies were named as defendants in an action filed by three plaintiffs in august in the circuit court of lowndes county  mississippi  asserting claims stemming from alleged environmental contamination caused by an automobile parts manufacturing plant located in columbus  mississippi 
the plant was acquired by us as part of our acquisition of ut automotive in may and sold almost immediately thereafter  in june  to johnson electric holdings limited johnson electric 
in december  additional cases were filed by approximately  plaintiffs in the same court against us and other defendants relating to similar claims 
in september  we were dismissed as a party to these cases 
in the first half of  we were named again as a defendant in these same additional cases and were also named in five new actions filed by approximately individual plaintiffs related to alleged environmental contamination from the same facility 
the plaintiffs in these actions are persons who allegedly were either residents and or owned property near the facility or worked at the facility 
in november  two additional lawsuits were filed by plaintiffs individuals and organizations  alleging property damage as a result of the alleged contamination 
each of these complaints seeks compensatory and punitive damages 
all of the plaintiffs have dismissed their claims for health effects and personal injury damages without prejudice 
there is the potential that these plaintiffs could seek separate counsel to re file their personal injury claims 
currently  there are approximately plaintiffs remaining in the lawsuits who are proceeding with property damage claims only 
in march  the venue for these lawsuits was transferred from lowndes county  mississippi  to lafayette county  mississippi 
in april  certain plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging negligence  nuisance  intentional tort and conspiracy claims and seeking compensatory and punitive damages 
in april  the court scheduled the first trial date for the first group of plaintiffs to commence march the march trial date has since been continued until a date to be set by the court  and discovery has extended into the first quarter of utc  the former owner of ut automotive  and johnson electric have each sought indemnification for losses associated with the mississippi claims from us under the respective acquisition agreements  and we have claimed indemnification from them under the same agreements 
to date  no company admits to  or has been found to have  an obligation to fully defend and indemnify any other 
we intend to vigorously defend against these claims and believe that we will eventually be indemnified by either utc or johnson electric for a substantial portion of the resulting losses  if any 
however  the ultimate outcome of these matters is unknown 
other matters in january  the securities and exchange commission the sec commenced an informal inquiry into our september amendment of our form k 
the amendment was filed to report our employment of 
table of contents relatives of certain of our directors and officers and certain related party transactions 
the sec s inquiry does not relate to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the staff of the sec informed us that it proposed to recommend to the sec that it issue an administrative cease and desist order as a result of our failure to disclose the related party transactions in question prior to the amendment of our form k 
we expect to consent to the entry of the order as part of a settlement of this matter 
in february  we received a subpoena from the sec in connection with an ongoing investigation of general motors corporation by the sec 
this investigation has been previously reported by general motors as involving  among other things  general motors accounting for payments and credits by suppliers 
the sec subpoena seeks the production of documents relating to payments or credits by us to general motors from to the present 
we are cooperating with the sec in connection with this matter 
prior to our acquisition of ut automotive from utc in may  one of our subsidiaries purchased the stock of a ut automotive subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to indemnify utc for certain tax consequences if the internal revenue service the irs overturned utc s tax treatment of the transaction 
the irs proposed an adjustment to utc s tax treatment of the transaction seeking an increase in tax of approximately million  excluding interest 
in april  a protest objecting to the proposed adjustment was filed with the irs 
the case was then referred to the appeals office of the irs for an independent review 
there have been several meetings and discussions with the irs appeals personnel in an attempt to resolve the case 
although we believe that valid support exists for utc s tax positions  we and utc are currently in settlement negotiations with the irs 
an indemnity payment by us to utc for the ultimate amount due to the irs would constitute an adjustment to the purchase price and resulting goodwill of the ut automotive acquisition  if and when made  and would not be expected to have a material effect on our reported earnings 
although we record reserves for legal  product warranty and environmental matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ significantly from current estimates

we are involved in certain other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business  including  without limitation  commercial disputes  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims  tax claims and employment matters

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were incorporated in delaware in and are one of the world s largest automotive interior systems suppliers based on net sales 
our net sales have grown from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december  we supply every major automotive manufacturer in the world  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  psa  volkswagen  fiat  renault nissan  hyundai  mazda  subaru and toyota 
we supply automotive manufacturers with complete automotive seat systems  electrical distribution systems and various electronic products 
we also supply automotive interior components and systems  including instrument panels and cockpit systems  headliners and overhead systems  door panels and flooring and acoustic systems 
in light of recent customer and market trends  we have been evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to our interior segment 
on october   we entered into a framework agreement relating to a proposed joint venture relationship with wl ross co 
llc and franklin mutual advisers  llc 
we would hold a non controlling interest in the new joint venture that would explore acquisition opportunities in the automotive interior components sector  including a possible acquisition of all or a portion of collins aikman corporation 
the proposed joint venture would involve all or a portion of our interior segment  but not our seating or electronic and electrical segments 
establishment of the proposed joint venture is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and other conditions 
in the event that we fail to achieve resolution on various matters in such negotiations  we will continue to explore other strategic alternatives with respect to this segment 
no assurances can be given that the proposed joint venture will be completed on the terms contemplated or at all 
demand for our products is directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production can be affected by general economic or industry conditions  labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
our operating results are also significantly impacted by what is referred to in this section as vehicle platform mix  that is  the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products  as well as our relative profitability on these platforms 
a significant loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier  or a decrease in the production levels of any such models  could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results 
in addition  our two largest customers  general motors and ford  accounted for approximately of our net sales in  excluding net sales to saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford 
the automotive operations of both general motors and ford experienced significant operating losses in and recently announced restructuring actions  which could have a material impact on our future operating results 
automotive industry conditions in north america and europe continue to be challenging 
in north america  the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity  fierce competition and significant pension and healthcare liabilities for the domestic automakers 
in europe  the market structure is more fragmented with significant overcapacity 
we expect these challenging industry conditions to continue in the foreseeable future 
during  the domestic automakers lowered production levels on several of our key platforms  particularly within the traditional sport utility vehicle market segment 
in addition  many of our key platforms in north america and europe underwent model changeovers or refreshenings in as a result  our vehicle platform mix had a material adverse impact on our operating results in  and we experienced a significant increase in launch costs 
launch costs are expected to moderate in in  the market share of certain of our key customers in both north america and europe declined 
there remains considerable uncertainty regarding our customers production schedules in historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from the us based automotive manufacturers in north america and  to a lesser extent  automotive manufacturers in western europe 
as discussed below  our ability to increase sales in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our penetration of asian automotive manufacturers worldwide and leverage our existing north american and european customer base across all product lines 
see item a  risk factors 

table of contents our customers require us to reduce costs and  at the same time  assume significant responsibility for the design  development and engineering of our products 
our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to achieve product cost reductions through manufacturing efficiencies  product design enhancement and supply chain management 
we also seek to enhance our profitability by investing in technology  design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers and consumers 
we continually evaluate alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and to lower the operating costs of our company 
in the second quarter of  we began to implement consolidation and census actions in order to address unfavorable industry conditions 
these actions continued in the third and fourth quarters of and are part of a comprehensive restructuring strategy intended to i better align our manufacturing capacity with the changing needs of our customers  ii eliminate excess capacity and lower our operating costs and iii streamline our organizational structure and reposition our business for improved long term profitability 
in connection with the restructuring actions  we expect to incur pretax costs of approximately million  although all aspects of the restructuring actions have not been finalized 
the restructuring actions recently announced by general motors and ford may require certain restructuring actions on our part that could increase the overall cost of our restructuring 
our material cost as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in a substantial portion of this increase was the result of less favorable vehicle platform mix and increases in certain raw material  energy and commodity costs  as well as net selling price reductions 
increases in certain raw material  energy and commodity costs principally steel  resins and other oil based commodities had a material adverse impact on our operating results in these conditions worsened as a result of the gulf coast storms in the third quarter of unfavorable industry conditions have also resulted in financial distress within our supply base and an increase in commercial disputes and the risk of supply disruption 
we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material  energy and commodity costs  which include aggressive cost reduction actions  the utilization of our cost technology optimization process  the selective in sourcing of components where we have available capacity  the continued consolidation of our supply base and the acceleration of low cost country sourcing and engineering 
however  due to the magnitude and duration of the increased raw material  energy and commodity costs  these strategies  together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers  offset only a portion of the adverse impact 
we expect that high raw material  energy and commodity costs will continue to have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future 
see item a  risk factors high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we focus primarily on profitable sales growth and cash flows  as well as return on investment on a consolidated basis 
in addition to maintaining and expanding our business with our existing customers in our more established markets  we have increased our emphasis on expanding our business in the asian market including sourcing activity in asia and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
the asian market presents growth opportunities  as automotive manufacturers expand production in this market to meet increasing demand 
we currently have twelve joint ventures in china and several other joint ventures dedicated to serving asian automotive manufacturers 
we will continue to seek ways to expand our business in the asian market and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
in addition  we have improved our low cost country manufacturing capabilities through expansion in asia  eastern europe and central america 
our success in generating cash flow will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently manage working capital 
working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases 
in this regard  changes in certain customer payment terms had a one time material adverse impact on our reported cash flows in  but these changes are not expected to impact reported cash flows for full year historically  we have been generally successful in aligning our vendor payment terms with our customer payment terms 
however  our ability to continue to do so may be adversely impacted by the recent decline in our financial results and adverse industry conditions 
in addition  our cash flow is also dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our capital spending 
capital spending  as well as expenditures for recoverable customer engineering and tooling  increased in as compared to prior years  primarily as a result of spending to support new program awards and investments in common seat architecture 
capital spending is expected to moderate in 
table of contents we utilize return on investment as a measure of the efficiency with which assets are deployed to increase earnings 
improvements in our return on investment will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency 
the level of profitability and the return on investment of our interior segment is below that of our seating and electronic and electrical segments 
our interior segment continues to experience unfavorable operating results  primarily as a result of higher raw material costs  lower production volumes on key platforms  industry overcapacity  insufficient customer pricing and changes in certain customers sourcing strategies 
in  we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill within our interior segment for potential impairment and recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately billion 
we also concluded that certain fixed assets within our interior segment were materially impaired and recorded fixed asset impairment charges of million 
in  we incurred costs of million related to the restructuring actions described above  including million of restructuring charges and million of manufacturing inefficiencies 
in addition  we recognized aggregate charges of million related to the divestiture of an equity investment in a non core business and the capital restructuring of two previously unconsolidated affiliates 
in  we incurred estimated costs of million related to facility closures and other similar actions 
for further information regarding to these items  see restructuring and note  restructuring  and note  investments in affiliates and other related party transactions  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
during  operating losses generated in the united states resulted in an increase in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
in light of our recent operating performance in the united states and current industry conditions  we assessed  based upon all available evidence  whether it was more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a tax charge of million comprised of i a full valuation allowance of million and ii an increase in related tax reserves of million 
although the tax charge did not result in current cash expenditures  it did negatively impact net income  assets and stockholders equity as of and for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we recorded a tax benefit of million resulting from a tax law change in poland

the impact of new business  net foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the acquisition of grote hartmann favorably impacted net sales by billion  million and million  respectively 
these increases were largely offset by less favorable vehicle platform mix  particularly in north america  which reduced net sales by billion 
gross profit and gross margin were million and in  as compared to billion and in the declines in gross profit and gross margin were largely due to less favorable vehicle platform mix and net selling price reductions  which collectively reduced gross profit by million 
gross profit also declined by million as a result of fixed asset impairment charges and costs related to restructuring actions 
the benefit from new business and our productivity initiatives and other efficiencies was largely offset by the net impact of higher raw material and commodity costs and inefficiencies associated with increased program launch activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the period was primarily due to a decline in compensation related expenses and our overall cost control initiatives  as well as a decrease in research and development expenses 
these decreases were largely offset by increases in litigation related charges 
research and development costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods  to the extent not recoverable from the customer  are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses as incurred 
such costs totaled million in and million in in certain situations  the reimbursement of pre production engineering  research and design costs is contractually guaranteed by  and fully recoverable from  our customers and is therefore capitalized 
for the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of such costs 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in short term interest rates and the interest component of litigation related charges  partially offset by the refinancing of our primary credit facility and a portion of our senior notes at lower interest rates and a decrease in interest expense related to our use of factoring and asset backed securitization facilities

the provision for income taxes was million  representing an effective tax rate of negative  for the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the impact of the goodwill impairment charges for which no tax benefit was provided as this goodwill is nondeductible for tax purposes  as well as the tax charge related to our decision to provide a full valuation allowance with respect to our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of no tax benefit was provided on the portion of the restructuring and litigation related charges that were incurred in certain countries for which no tax benefit is likely to be realized due to a history of operating losses in those countries 
these items were partially offset by a one time benefit of million in the first quarter of resulting from a tax law change in poland

restructuring in order to address unfavorable industry conditions  we began to implement consolidation and census actions in the second quarter of these actions are part of a comprehensive restructuring strategy intended to i better align our manufacturing capacity with the changing needs of our customers  ii eliminate excess capacity and lower our operating costs and iii streamline our organizational structure and reposition our business for improved long term profitability 
in connection with the restructuring actions  we expect to incur pre tax costs of approximately million  although all aspects of the restructuring actions have not been finalized 
such costs will include employee termination benefits  asset impairment charges and contract termination costs  as well as other incremental costs resulting from the restructuring actions 
these incremental restructuring costs will principally include equipment and personnel relocation costs 
we also expect to incur incremental manufacturing inefficiency costs at the operating locations impacted by the restructuring actions during the related restructuring implementation period 
restructuring costs will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally  charges will be recorded as elements of the restructuring strategy are finalized 
actual costs recorded in our consolidated financial statements may vary from current estimates 
in connection with our restructuring actions  we recorded restructuring and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of million in  including million recorded as cost of sales and million recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
the remaining amounts include a gain on the sale of a facility  which is recorded as other expense  net 
these charges resulted in cash expenditures of million in the charges consist of employee termination benefits of million for salaried and  hourly employees  asset impairment charges of million and contract termination costs of million  as well as other costs of million 
we also estimate that we incurred approximately million in manufacturing inefficiency costs during this period as a result of the restructuring 
employee termination benefits were recorded based on existing union and employee contracts  statutory requirements and completed negotiations 
asset impairment charges relate to the disposal of buildings  leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment with carrying values of million in excess of related estimated fair values

and in december  we initiated actions affecting two of our us seating facilities 
as a result of these actions  we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively  for employee termination benefits and asset impairments 
these actions were completed in the second quarter of in  we also incurred million in estimated costs related to additional facility consolidations and closures and census reductions 
acquisition on july   we completed the acquisition of the parent of ghw grote hartmann gmbh grote hartmann for consideration of million  including assumed debt of million  subject to adjustment 
this amount excludes the cost of integration  as well as other internal costs related to the transaction which were expensed as incurred 
grote hartmann was based in wuppertal  germany  and manufactured terminals and connectors  as well as junction boxes  primarily for the automotive industry 
the grote hartmann acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the assets purchased and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the operating results of grote hartmann are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
liquidity and financial condition our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  service indebtedness and support working capital requirements 
in addition  approximately of the costs associated with our current restructuring strategy are expected to require cash expenditures 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under available credit facilities 
a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and the combination of dividends  distributions and advances from our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to lear 
for further information regarding potential dividends from our non us subsidiaries  see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in net income loss  excluding impairment charges  deferred tax provision benefit and equity in net income loss of affiliates  declined by million between years

holders may require us to purchase their notes on each of february   and  as well as upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes  at their accreted value on such dates 
on august   we amended our outstanding zero coupon convertible senior notes to require the settlement of any repurchase obligation with respect to the notes for cash only 
subsidiary guarantees our obligations under the senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the amended and restated primary credit facility 
in the event that any such subsidiary ceases to be a guarantor under the amended and restated primary credit facility  such subsidiary will be released as a guarantor of the senior notes

borrowings under our amended and restated primary credit facility bear interest at variable rates  and we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed rate obligations to variable rate 
therefore  an increase in interest rates would reduce our profitability 
see market risk sensitivity 
in addition to the obligations set forth above  we have capital requirements with respect to new programs 
we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
although such agreements do not provide for minimum quantities  once we enter into such agreements  we are generally required to fulfill our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
prior to being formally awarded a program  we typically work closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering a 
table of contents vehicle s interior systems 
failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle s interior systems  or to fulfill a customer s contract  could adversely affect our business 
we also enter into agreements with suppliers to assist us in meeting our customers production needs 
these agreements vary as to duration and quantity commitments 
historically  most have been short term agreements not providing for minimum purchases or are requirements based contracts 
we also have minimum funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our domestic and foreign pension plans in as compared to million in our minimum funding requirements after will depend on several factors  including the investment performance of our retirement plans and prevailing interest rates 
our funding obligations may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements 
we also have payments due with respect to our postretirement benefit obligations

although we utilized the abs facility throughout  as of december   there were no accounts receivable sold under this facility 
the level of funding utilized under this facility is based on the credit ratings of our major customers  the level of aggregate accounts receivable in a specific month and our funding requirements 
should our major customers experience further reductions in their credit ratings  we may be unable to utilize the abs facility in the future 
should this occur  we would intend to utilize our amended and restated primary credit facility to replace the funding currently provided by the abs facility

common stock repurchase program in may  our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program which permitted the discretionary repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an initial period of months  as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  in may  the program was extended until may  as disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended april  in  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of per share  excluding commissions of to per share  under this program

in  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of per share  excluding commissions of per share  under this program 
in  there were no shares of our common stock repurchased under this program 
as of december    shares of common stock were available for repurchase under the common stock repurchase program 
the extent to which we will repurchase our common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions  alternative uses of capital and other factors 
see forward looking statements 
adequacy of liquidity sources we believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including capital expenditures and anticipated working capital requirements  for the foreseeable future 
certain of our debt will mature in the first quarter of  and we are currently exploring refinancing alternatives 
our cash flows from operations  borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties 
see item a  risk factors  executive overview and forward looking statements 
market risk sensitivity in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with management s guidelines 
we enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange operating results may be impacted by our buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies transactional exposure 
we mitigate this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange  futures and option contracts 
the foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy 
gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred and included in the 
table of contents measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions 
our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to the mexican peso  the canadian dollar and the euro 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall currency rate exposure as of december  the potential earnings benefit related to net transactional exposures from a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
the potential earnings benefit related to net transactional exposures from a similar strengthening of the euro relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
as of december   foreign exchange contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturities of less than twelve months 
as of december   the fair market value of these contracts was approximately million 
a change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
a change in the value of the euro relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented 
the analysis assumes that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar or euro 
in reality  some currencies may strengthen while others may weaken  causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement 
in addition to the transactional exposure described above  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
in  net sales outside of the united states accounted for of our consolidated net sales 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure 
interest rates we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
our exposure to variable interest rates on outstanding variable rate debt instruments indexed to united states or european monetary union short term money market rates is partially managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts to convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
we also utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert certain fixed rate debt obligations to variable rate  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
all of our interest rate swap contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies that match the underlying debt instrument 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations on an accrual basis 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall interest rate exposure as of december  this analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point parallel shift in interest rates at all points of the yield curve 
the potential adverse earnings impact from this hypothetical increase for is approximately million 
as of december   interest rate swap contracts representing million of notional amount were outstanding with maturity dates of september through may of these outstanding contracts  million are designated as fair value hedges and modify the fixed rate characteristics of our outstanding senior notes due may the remaining million are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate characteristics of our variable rate debt instruments 
the fair market value of all outstanding interest rate swap contracts is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the fair market value of these contracts was approximately negative million 
a basis point parallel shift in interest rates would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
commodity prices we have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of certain raw materials  including steel  leather  resins  chemicals and diesel fuel 
in limited circumstances  we have used financial instruments to mitigate this risk 

table of contents increases in certain raw material  energy and commodity costs principally steel  resins and other oil based commodities had a material adverse impact on our operating results in these conditions worsened as a result of the gulf coast storms in the third quarter of unfavorable industry conditions have also resulted in financial distress within our supply base and an increase in commercial disputes and the risk of supply disruption 
we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material  energy and commodity costs  which include aggressive cost reduction actions  the utilization of our cost technology optimization process  the selective in sourcing of components where we have available capacity  the continued consolidation of our supply base and the acceleration of low cost country sourcing and engineering 
however  due to the magnitude and duration of the increased raw material  energy and commodity costs  these strategies  together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers  offset only a portion of the adverse impact 
we expect that high raw material  energy and commodity costs will continue to have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future 
see item a  risk factors high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability  and forward looking statements

other matters legal and environmental matters we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and claims  including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers and competitors 
largely as a result of generally unfavorable industry conditions and financial distress within the automotive supply base  we experienced an increase in commercial and contractual disputes  particularly with our suppliers 
these disputes vary in nature and are usually resolved by negotiations between the parties 
on january   seton company seton  one of our leather suppliers  filed a suit alleging that we had breached a purported agreement to purchase leather from seton for seats for the life of the general motors gmt program 
seton filed the lawsuit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan seeking compensatory and exemplary damages totaling approximately million  plus interest  on breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims 
in may  this case proceeded to trial  and the jury returned a million verdict against us 
on september   the court denied our post trial motions challenging the judgment and granted seton s motion to award prejudgment interest in the amount of approximately million 
we are appealing the judgment and the interest award 
on january   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against johnson controls inc and johnson controls interiors llc together  jci in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan alleging that jci s garage door opener products infringed certain of our radio frequency transmitter patents 
jci counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the subject patents are invalid and unenforceable  and that jci is not infringing these patents 
jci also has filed motions for summary judgment asserting that its garage door opener products do not infringe our patents 
we are vigorously pursuing our claims against jci and discovery is on going 
a trial in the case is currently scheduled for the second quarter of after we filed our patent infringement action against jci  affiliates of jci sued one of our vendors and certain of the vendor s employees in ottawa circuit court  michigan  on july   alleging misappropriation of trade secrets 
the suit alleges that the defendants misappropriated and shared with us trade secrets involving jci s universal garage door opener product 
jci seeks to enjoin the defendants from selling or attempting to sell a competing product 
we are not a defendant in this lawsuit  however  the agreements between us and the defendants contain customary indemnification provisions 
we do not believe that our garage door opener product benefited from any allegedly misappropriated trade secrets or technology 
however  jci has sought discovery of certain information which we believe is confidential and proprietary  and we have intervened in the case for the limited purpose of protecting our rights with respect to jci s discovery efforts 
discovery has been extended to july a trial date has not yet been scheduled 

table of contents on june   the chamberlain group chamberlain filed a lawsuit against us and ford motor company ford in the northern district of illinois alleging patent infringement 
two counts were asserted against us and ford based upon chamberlain s rolling code security system patent and a related product which operates transmitters to actuate garage door openers 
two additional counts were asserted against ford only not us based upon different chamberlain patents 
the chamberlain lawsuit was filed in connection with the marketing of our universal garage door opener system  which competes with a product offered by jci 
jci obtained technology from chamberlain to operate its product 
in october  jci joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff along with chamberlain  and chamberlain dismissed its infringement claims against ford based upon its rolling security system patent 
jci and chamberlain have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction  which we are contesting 
we are vigorously defending the claims asserted in this lawsuit 
a trial date has not yet been scheduled 
we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean up costs resulting from past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on iso to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of ut automotive  inc ut automotive 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation utc in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive

while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
one of our subsidiaries and certain predecessor companies were named as defendants in an action filed by three plaintiffs in august in the circuit court of lowndes county  mississippi  asserting claims stemming from alleged environmental contamination caused by an automobile parts manufacturing plant located in columbus  mississippi 
the plant was acquired by us as part of our acquisition of ut automotive in may and sold almost immediately thereafter  in june  to johnson electric holdings limited johnson electric 
in december  additional cases were filed by approximately  plaintiffs in the same court against us and other defendants relating to similar claims 
in september  we were dismissed as a party to these cases 
in the first half of  we were named again as a defendant in these same additional cases and were also named in five new actions filed by approximately individual plaintiffs related to alleged environmental contamination from the same facility 
the plaintiffs in these actions are persons who allegedly were either residents and or owned property near the facility or worked at the facility 
in november  two additional lawsuits were filed by plaintiffs individuals and organizations  alleging property damage as a result of the alleged contamination 
each of these complaints seeks compensatory and punitive damages 
all of the plaintiffs have dismissed their claims for health effects and personal injury damages without prejudice 
there is the potential that these plaintiffs could seek separate counsel to re file their personal injury claims 
currently  there are approximately plaintiffs remaining in the lawsuits who are proceeding with property damage claims only 
in march  the venue for these lawsuits was transferred from lowndes county  mississippi  to lafayette county  mississippi 
in april  certain plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging negligence  nuisance  intentional tort and conspiracy claims and seeking compensatory and punitive damages 
in april  the court scheduled the first trial date for the first group of plaintiffs to commence march the march trial date has since been continued until a date to be set by the court  and discovery has extended into the first quarter of utc  the former owner of ut automotive  and johnson electric have each sought indemnification for losses associated with the mississippi claims from us under the respective acquisition agreements  and we have claimed 
table of contents indemnification from them under the same agreements 
to date  no company admits to  or has been found to have  an obligation to fully defend and indemnify any other 
we intend to vigorously defend against these claims and believe that we will eventually be indemnified by either utc or johnson electric for a substantial portion of the resulting losses  if any 
however  the ultimate outcome of these matters is unknown 
in january  the securities and exchange commission the sec commenced an informal inquiry into our september amendment of our form k 
the amendment was filed to report our employment of relatives of certain of our directors and officers and certain related party transactions 
the sec s inquiry does not relate to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the staff of the sec informed us that it proposed to recommend to the sec that it issue an administrative cease and desist order as a result of our failure to disclose the related party transactions in question prior to the amendment of our form k 
we expect to consent to the entry of the order as part of a settlement of this matter 
in february  we received a subpoena from the sec in connection with an ongoing investigation of general motors corporation by the sec 
this investigation has been previously reported by general motors as involving  among other things  general motors accounting for payments and credits by suppliers 
the sec subpoena seeks the production of documents relating to payments or credits by us to general motors from to the present 
we are cooperating with the sec in connection with this matter 
although we record reserves for legal  product warranty and environmental matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ significantly from current estimates 
see item a  risk factors 
for further information regarding legal and environmental matters  see item  legal proceedings 
certain tax matters ut automotive prior to our acquisition of ut automotive from utc in may  one of our subsidiaries purchased the stock of a ut automotive subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to indemnify utc for certain tax consequences if the internal revenue service the irs overturned utc s tax treatment of the transaction 
the irs proposed an adjustment to utc s tax treatment of the transaction seeking an increase in tax of approximately million  excluding interest 
in april  a protest objecting to the proposed adjustment was filed with the irs 
the case was then referred to the appeals office of the irs for an independent review 
there have been several meetings and discussions with the irs appeals personnel in an attempt to resolve the case 
although we believe that valid support exists for utc s tax positions  we and utc are currently in settlement negotiations with the irs 
an indemnity payment by us to utc for the ultimate amount due to the irs would constitute an adjustment to the purchase price and resulting goodwill of the ut automotive acquisition  if and when made  and would not be expected to have a material effect on our reported earnings 
american jobs creation act of in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations to the extent the dividends exceed a base amount and are invested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan 
the temporary incentive was available to us until december  the amount of our dividends potentially eligible for the deduction was limited to million 
after completing our evaluation  we decided not to pursue dividends under the repatriation provision of the act due to numerous tax and treasury considerations 
this decision had no effect on our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of our accounting policies require 
table of contents management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements we incur pre production engineering  research and development er d and tooling costs related to the products produced for our customers under long term supply agreements 
we expense all pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  we expense all pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has not provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
during and  we also capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we collected million and million  respectively  of cash related to er d and tooling costs 
gains and losses related to er d and tooling projects are reviewed on an aggregate program basis 
net gains on projects are deferred and recognized over the life of the related long term supply agreement 
net losses on projects are recognized as costs are incurred 
a change in the commercial arrangements affecting any of our significant programs that would require us to expense er d or tooling costs that we currently capitalize could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
goodwill as of december  and  we had recorded goodwill of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment  or decline in value  may have occurred 
in conducting our impairment testing  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to the related net book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recognized 
we conduct our annual impairment testing on the first day of the fourth quarter each year 
we utilize an income approach to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the income approach is based on projected debt free cash flow which is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operating cash flow performance 
this approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical downturns that occur in the industry 
fair value is estimated using recent automotive industry and specific platform production volume projections  which are based on both third party and internally developed forecasts  as well as commercial  wage and benefit  inflation and discount rate assumptions 
other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates  terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management s application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 

table of contents during the third quarter of  events occurred which indicated a significant decline in the fair value of our interior segment  as well as an impairment of the related goodwill 
these events included unfavorable operating results  primarily as a result of higher raw material costs  lower production volumes on key platforms  industry overcapacity  insufficient customer pricing and changes in certain customers sourcing strategies  as well as our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to this segment 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we evaluated the net book value of goodwill within our interior segment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value 
as a result  we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  additional events occurred which indicated a further decline in the fair value of our interior segment 
these events included a further deterioration of the commercial outlook for this segment  as well as an updated assessment of our ability to recover the increase in the costs associated with resin based raw materials in north america 
we updated the fair value estimate for this segment and finalized the implied fair value of goodwill pursuant to asset valuation and allocation procedures 
as a result  we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the annual impairment testing for our remaining segments was completed as of october   and there was no additional impairment 
long lived assets we monitor our long lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform the required analysis and record impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
in conducting our analysis  we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the net book value  the long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is measured and recognized 
an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is estimated based upon either discounted cash flow analyses or estimated salvage values 
cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments  as well as assumptions related to discount rates 
changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long lived assets 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we evaluated the net book value of the fixed assets of certain operating locations within our interior segment 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
consistent with the goodwill impairment charges  the fixed asset impairment charges are due to the unfavorable operating results of our interior segment  as well as the deterioration of the commercial outlook for this segment 
also in  we recorded fixed asset impairment charges of million in conjunction with our restructuring actions 
we have certain other facilities that have generated operating losses in recent years 
the results of the related impairment analyses indicated that impairment of the fixed assets was not required 
however  we will continue to monitor the operating plans of these facilities for potential impairment 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain facility consolidations 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain facility consolidations and impairment charges of million related to other facility closures  an early program termination and ongoing losses at certain of our facilities 
these fixed asset impairment charges are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and restructuring accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions  as well as the integration of acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates primarily related to facility consolidations and closures  census reductions and contract termination costs 
actual costs may vary from these estimates 
restructuring related 
table of contents accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and changes to the restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 
legal and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans approximately of our active workforce is covered by defined benefit pension plans 
approximately of our active workforce is covered by other postretirement benefit plans 
pension plans provide benefits based on plan specific benefit formulas as defined by the applicable plan documents 
postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for all eligible employees 
we also have contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits 
in general  our policy is to fund our pension benefit obligation based on legal requirements  tax considerations and local practices 
we do not fund our postretirement benefit obligation 
as of december  based on a september  measurement date  our projected benefit obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million and million  respectively  and our unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were million and million  respectively 
these benefit obligations were valued using a weighted average discount rate of and for domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  and and for foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the determination of the discount rate is based on the construction of a hypothetical bond portfolio consisting of high quality fixed income securities with durations that match the timing of expected benefit payments 
changes in the selected discount rate could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligations and the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirment benefit plans 
decreasing the discount rate by would have increased the projected benefit obligations and underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost was million and million  respectively  and was determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions 
pension net periodic benefit cost in was calculated using a weighted average discount rate of for both domestic and foreign plans and an expected return on plan assets of and for domestic and foreign plans  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on several factors  including adjusted historical returns  historical risk premiums for various asset classes and target asset allocations within the portfolio 
adjustments made to the historical returns are based on recent return experience in the equity and fixed income markets and the belief that deviations from historical returns are likely over the relevant investment horizon 
other postretirement net periodic benefit cost was calculated in using a discount rate of and for domestic and foreign plans  respectively 
adjustments to our actuarial assumptions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
decreasing the discount rate by would have increased pension and other postretirement periodic net benefit cost by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  for the year ended december  decreasing the expected return on plan assets by would have increased pension net periodic benefit cost by approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents aggregate pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately million in this estimate is based on a weighted average discount rate of and for domestic and foreign pension plans  respectively  and and for domestic and foreign other postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
actual cost is also dependent on various other factors related to the employees covered by these plans 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our domestic and foreign pension plans in contributions to our pension plans are consistent with minimum funding requirements of the relevant governmental authorities 
we may make contributions in excess of these minimums when we believe it is financially advantageous to do so and based on our other capital requirements

revenue recognition and sales commitments we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
although such agreements do not provide for minimum quantities  once we enter into such agreements  we are generally required to fulfill our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time 
historically  terminations of these agreements have been minimal 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses as they are incurred 
we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers on an annual basis 
generally  each purchase order provides the annual terms  including pricing  related to a particular vehicle model 
purchase orders do not specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our annual purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenue as our products are shipped to our customers 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes in determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments  which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
in completing this evaluation  we consider all available evidence 
such evidence includes historical results  expectations for future pretax operating income  the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
during  operating losses generated in the united states resulted in an increase in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
in light of our recent operating performance in the united states and current industry conditions  we assessed  based upon all available evidence  whether it was more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a tax charge of million comprised of i a full valuation allowance of million and ii an increase in related tax reserves of million 
although the tax charge did not result in current cash expenditures  it did negatively impact net income  assets and stockholders equity as of and for the year ended december  as of december   we recorded a us valuation allowance of million and a valuation allowance for certain foreign tax jurisdictions of 
table of contents million 
we intend to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our future income tax expense will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
in addition  the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits  the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities 
for further information related to income taxes  see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
during  there were no material changes in the methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions 
generally  matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization  inventory obsolescence  asset impairments  unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers  restructuring accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes  pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions  accruals related to litigation  warranty and environmental remediation costs and self insurance accruals
