item a 
risk factors in evaluating the company  careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and or financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company s common stock 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
if we do not accurately forecast consumer demand  we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers orders  either of which could adversely affect our business 
the footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations and declines in performance  as well as fashion risks and rapid changes in consumer preferences  the effects of weather  general economic conditions and other factors affecting demand 
furthermore  the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for the design and manufacturing of products 
consequently  we must commit to production based on our forecasts of consumer demand 
if we overestimate demand for our products  we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at a discount to customers  resulting in markdowns and lower gross margins 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand  we could have inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strains on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
a decline in demand for our products  or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is substantially affected by the weather  and sustained periods of warm and or dry weather can negatively impact our sales 
we sell our products to the work and outdoor footwear markets 
many of our outdoor products are designed for use in cold and or wet weather 
sales of these products are largely dependent on the timing 
table of contents and severity of weather in the different regions of the united states 
prolonged periods of relatively dry and or warm weather  particularly in the fall and winter  could have an adverse affect on demand for our products 
a decline in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic conditions could hinder our product revenues and earnings 
footwear  particularly outdoor and recreational footwear  is a cyclical industry that is largely dependent upon overall levels of consumer spending 
the success of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to consumers and their purchasing preferences 
our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and canceling orders 
as a result  our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  an increase in energy costs or interest rates  any significant acts of nature  terrorist events  and any other event that could diminish consumer spending and overall consumer confidence 
we conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing activities outside the us  and therefore we are subject to the risks of international commerce 
we use third party manufacturers located in foreign countries  primarily in china  to manufacture the majority of our goods  including all of our lacrosse branded products 
we also sell a growing percentage of our products to retailers outside of the us foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks  including the following tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules  increased transportation costs due to distance  energy prices or other factors  delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns  foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro and chinese renminbi  for which we do not currently engage in any material hedging transactions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  changing economic conditions  restrictions  due to privacy laws  on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information  changes in governmental policies and regulations  political unrest  terrorism or war  any of which can interrupt commerce  expropriation and nationalization  difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the us  difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  and limited capital of foreign distributors additionally  although sales outside of the us did not constitute a significant portion of our revenues in  our international sales have grown over the past several years 
our ability to continue to do business in international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations  as noted above  as well as the difficulties associated with promoting products in emerging markets 
we are also subject to additional risk as the company has a limited number of foreign distributors  who in turn have limited 
table of contents capital investment 
sales to the international markets are achieved through those foreign distributors 
if the relationship with those distributors were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact assuming the company is unable to engage suitable alternatives in a timely manner 
because we depend on third party manufacturers  we face challenges in maintaining a timely supply of goods to meet sales demand  and we may experience delay or interruptions in our supply chain 
any shortfall or delay in the supply of our products may decrease our sales and have an adverse impact on our customer relationships 
in  third party manufacturers produced approximately of our footwear products 
currently  we have footwear manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers located in china and europe 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over the third party manufacturers  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
due to various factors  one or more of our third party manufacturers may be unable to continue meeting our production requirements 
moreover  some of our third party manufacturers have manufacturing engagements with companies that are much larger than we are and whose production needs are much greater than ours 
as a result  one or more manufacturers may choose to devote additional resources to the production of products other than ours if capacity is limited 
in addition  we do not have long term supply contracts with these third party manufacturers  and any of them may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of products of an acceptable quality and price from our third party manufacturers 
we may be unable to offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in our company operated manufacturing facilities due to capacity constraints  and we may be unable to substitute suitable alternative third party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices 
any disruption in the supply of products from our third party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to efficiently import foreign sourced products could result in decreased margins  cancelled orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation 
our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide 
labor disputes at various ports create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
furthermore  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
any major disruption at one of our two distribution facilities or our domestic manufacturing facility could prevent the timely delivery of our product 

table of contents we have distribution centers in portland  oregon and la crosse  wisconsin and a domestic manufacturing facility in portland  oregon 
both the distribution centers and the manufacturing facility are subject to union agreements 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption at one of these facilities due to labor unrest  fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or manmade cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our warehouse as a docking location for product 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the continued consolidation of retailers  and the leveraged growth in the overall number of stores  increases and concentrates the company s credit risk 
significant retailers in the work and outdoor retail industry continue to expand rapidly through construction of additional stores and acquisitions 
further  the industry continues to experience consolidation  resulting in a smaller number of primary retailers 
the increased capital requirements required to open and operate new stores concentrates the company s credit risk in a relatively small number of customers 
if these retailers were to extinguish their capital and were unable to replenish their liquidity  there is a risk that their outstanding payables to our company may not be paid 
our financial success may be limited by the strength of our relationships with our retail customers and to the success of such retail customers 
our financial success is significantly related to the willingness of our retail customers to continue to carry our products and to the success of such customers 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our retail customers  and sales to our retail customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer 
if we cannot fill our retail customers orders in a timely manner  the sales of our products and our relationships with those customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and ability to grow our product line 
in  our five largest retail customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
if any of our major retail customers experiences a significant downturn in their business or fails to remain committed to our products or brand  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us 
in addition  we extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
if a significant customer to whom we have extended credit experiences financial difficulties  our bad debt expense may increase relative to revenues in the future 
any significant increase in our bad debt expense relative to revenues would adversely impact our net income and cash flow and could affect our ability to pay our own obligations as they become due 
furthermore  many of our retail customers compete with each other  and if they perceive that we are offering their competitors better pricing and support  they may reduce purchases of our products 
we face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively  sales of our products may decline and our business could be harmed 
the footwear industry is highly competitive 
recent growth in the market for outdoor and work footwear has encouraged the entry of new competitors into the marketplace and has increased competition from established companies 
some of our competitors have products with similar characteristics  such as design and materials  to a number of our products 
in addition  access to offshore manufacturing is also making it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete 

table of contents our competitors include footwear manufactures  fashion oriented footwear marketers  vertically integrated specialty stores and retailers of private label products 
the principal methods of competition in our industry include product design  product performance  quality  brand image  price  marketing and promotion  customer support and service  the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers  obtaining access to retail outlets and sufficient floor space 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we have  have more comprehensive product lines than ours  have broader market presence than we have in retail outlets  or have their own retail outlets  have longer standing relationships with retailers than we have  have a longer operating history than ours  have greater distribution capabilities than we have  have stronger brand recognition than we have  and spend substantially more on product advertising and sales than we do 
our competitors greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry  compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products 
in addition  a major marketing or promotional success or technological innovation by one of our competitors could adversely impact our competitive position 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future  our sales and profits may decline  our financial condition may deteriorate and the market price of our common stock is likely to fall 
in addition  a growing trend in the footwear industry is for dealers and distributors to source product directly from overseas manufacturers in order to increase profitability by eliminating the wholesale distributor or manufacturer 
while dealers and distributors have not historically manufactured and developed new and innovative products  if consumers largely accept the directly sourced products  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unable to meet changing consumer preferences and demands 
the footwear industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and functional products at a pace  intensity  and price that is competitive with other brands in our market 
in addition  we must design and manufacture products that appeal to many consumer segments at a range of price points 
while we continually update our product line with new and innovative products  our products may not continue to be popular and new products we may introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
our failure to anticipate  identify and react to shifts in consumer preferences and maintain a strong brand image could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

table of contents changes in the price or availability of raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results 
we purchase raw materials  finished goods  and component parts from various suppliers to be used in the manufacturing of our products 
changes in our relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of purchased raw materials  component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions  delays  inefficiencies or our inability to market the products 
we also rely on transport companies to deliver our products from abroad to our distribution centers  and in some cases directly to our customers 
if petroleum costs were to increase it could cause a disruption in the transportation industry  which could result in significantly higher freight costs to our company 
increased petroleum costs also affect our manufacturing costs  as rubber is a key component of our footwear 
our profit margins may decrease if prices of purchased raw materials  component parts  finished goods  or petroleum increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position and reduce future revenues 
protecting our intellectual property is an important factor in maintaining our brand and our competitive position in the footwear industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
we have a number of licensing agreements  both for product  camouflage patterns and trademarks  which are significant to our business 
if the company is unable to renew the agreements  and suitable replacements are not available in a timely manner  this may reduce revenues 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials  and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs 
we depend on a limited number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear 
for example  we and our contract manufacturers purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both our lacrosse and danner footwear 
over of danner styles are gore tex lined 
either party upon days written notice may terminate our agreements with gore 
while we consider our relationship with gore to be good  if gore were to terminate our agreements  the time required to obtain substitute materials could interrupt our production cycle 
further  consumers may be unwilling to accept any such replacement material 
any termination or delay in our license with gore  or in the procurement of any other key component  could result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strained relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  including joseph p 
schneider  our president and chief executive officer  and david p 
carlson  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  product development engineers  sales people  and others 
we face intense competition for such 
table of contents individuals throughout the footwear and work and outdoor products industries 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated 
our revolving credit facility contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
however  among other factors  our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results  which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to a waiver of any future non compliance  we may be unable to borrow additional funds and our outstanding indebtedness may become immediately due and payable  which could materially harm our business 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws and wisconsin corporate law each contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management 
among other things  these provisions classify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and establish advance notice and other procedural requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions  which may prevent a change of control and or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable 
in addition  subchapter xi of the wisconsin business corporation law includes provisions that may discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control of us 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to maximize the work and outdoor experience for our customers 
to achieve this we develop and manufacture premium quality  performance footwear and apparel  supported by compelling marketing and superior customer service 
our products are primarily directed at both the retail consumer channel and the safety and industrial channel of distribution 
economic indicators that are important to our business include consumer confidence and unemployment rates 
increasing consumer confidence trends improve retail channel product sales  and increasing employment trends improve safety and industrial channel sales 
weather  especially in the fall and winter  has been  and will continue to be a significant contributing factor to our results 
sales are typically higher in the second half of the year due to our cold and wet weather product offerings 
we augment these offerings by infusing innovative technology into product categories that will create additional demand in all four quarters of the year  principally work products 
gross margins are an essential factor in funding marketing  sales and product development costs  in addition to producing our profits 
margin improvement of basis points for the year ended was primarily due to the company s strategic decision to exit the lower margin pvc market in late in addition  our recently introduced innovative product offerings have resulted in increased sales of higher margin products 
inventories increased by million during as a result of bringing innovative new products to market  further reducing customer service response times  and taking a strong position with core products to capture growth 
accounts receivable increased by million during  primarily a result of increased sales during the fourth quarter 
day s sales outstanding  or dso  increased slightly  from days in to days in  as measured by dividing total ending receivables for the quarter by the sales for the quarter multiplied by the increase in dso s can be traced to established sales programs  which have various terms and discounts

net sales in the outdoor market in increased from we believe the overall increase was the result of a refocus on profitable sales growth and increasing brand equity 
during  we launched several successful new innovative products 
in addition  during  the company fulfilled two gsa delivery orders to the united states government

income taxes during  all of the company s taxable income was offset by available net operating loss nol carryforwards 
at december   the company had recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization and timing of the benefits from those deferred tax assets  as the company had not achieved a sustained level of profitability 
during  management concluded that the company had attained a sufficient level of sustained annual profitability to allow the valuation allowance to be reduced to reflect management s estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized in the near term 
additionally  the valuation allowance was further reduced by approximately million associated with the estimated income tax benefit relative to the minimum pension liability recorded in equity  which had no effect on net income 
considering the projected levels of future income as well as the nature of the net deferred tax assets  management concluded that the deferred assets are fully realizable except for the deferred tax asset that relates to the majority of the company s state nol carryforwards 
the realization of these state nol carryforwards is dependent upon yet to be developed tax strategies as well as having taxable income in years well into the future 
in future periods of earnings  the company will report income tax expense at statutory rates offset by any further reductions in the valuation allowance based on an ongoing assessment of the future realization of the state nol deferred tax assets

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on the facts and circumstances as of december   however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped  the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of related receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  and bad debts are provided when the related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts  discounts and non defective returns we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the uncertainty of the ability of our customers to make required payment 
if the financial condition of the customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of the receivable balance  we would record an additional allowance 
we also record allowances for cash discounts and non defective returns 
periodically  management initiates additional sales programs that result in further discounts 
we analyze and assess the adequacy of each cash discount program to determine appropriate allowance levels and adjust as necessary 
allowance for slow moving inventory on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the allowance would 
table of contents be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of million at december  is adequate 
product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
we utilize historical trends and information received from customers to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
we believe our warranty liability of million at december  is adequate to cover the estimated costs we will incur in the future for warranty claims on products sold before december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill  property  and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill of million and the investments we have made in our other long term investments  primarily property and equipment of million  we have made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
please refer to the forward looking statements caption above for a discussion of factors that may have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to our annual consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations  our future expense and equity

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
 sfas r which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for our first quarter beginning january  we will use the modified prospective transition method which requires that awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
compensation cost for awards granted prior to  but not vested  as of the date sfas r is adopted will 
table of contents be based on the grant date attributes originally used to value those awards for proforma purposes under sfas in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
to provide supplemental guidance in adopting sfas no 
revised 
the bulletin provides guidance in accounting for share based transactions with non employees  valuation methods  the classification of compensation expense  accounting for the income tax effects of share based payments  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
revised 
the company is evaluating the adoption criteria outlined in sfas no 
r 
however  the pro forma effect on net income using the fair value method for the past three years is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma information may not be indicative of the actual effect on net income when sfas no 
r is adopted as such effect is dependent upon many factors  including the number of stock options granted in the future as well as their related terms 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  which clarifies terminology in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for the company in fiscal management does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
at our option  our line of credit interest rate is either the prime rate or the libor rate plus 
we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates 
based on average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would have caused the company s interest expense to change by approximately million 
the company believes that these amounts are not material to the earnings of the company 
we are also exposed to market risk related to the assumptions we make in estimating our pension liability 
the assumed discount rate used  in part  to calculate the pension plan obligation is related to the prevailing long term interest rates 
at december   we used an estimated discount rate of 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the actuarial present value of projected pension benefits of approximately million at december  with a similar charge to equity 
furthermore  a minus one percent change increase or decrease in the actual rate of return on pension plan assets would affect the additional minimum pension plan liability by approximately million
