the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes that follow 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
in general  forward looking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections  future economic performance  future operational plans and objectives  and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the company and its subsidiaries operate and lower interest margins  competition for the company s customers from other providers of financial services  deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products  government legislation  regulation  and changes in monetary and fiscal policies which changes from time to time and over which the company has no control  changes in interest rates  material unforeseen changes in the liquidity  results of operations  or financial condition of the company s customers  the capability of the company to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions  the possibility that acquired entities may not perform as well as expected  unexpected claims or litigation against the company  technological or operational difficulties  and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements after the date hereof to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our opinions or expectations 
application of critical accounting policies the company s audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s estimate of probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets 
additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions asset quality and nonperforming assets in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
executive level overview the company offers a variety of financial products and services at its banking locations in communities throughout central and northern kentucky

the company generates a significant amount of its revenue  cash flows  and net income from interest income and net interest income  respectively 
interest income is generated by earnings on the company s earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest expense paid on amounts borrowed to support those earning assets 
interest expense is paid primarily on deposits accounts and other short and long term borrowing arrangements 
the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the company 
in assessing the company s financial performance in this report  the following items of note should be considered o the general trend of the short term interest rate environment for was upward primarily as a result of short term interest rate increases by the federal reserve board the fed 
the fed began to increase the short term federal funds rate by increments of basis points during the last half of that continued into in all  the federal funds rate was increased basis points during and an additional basis points during and stood at at year end longer term yields  such as for the    and year treasuries  were generally up at year end compared to year end  with the   and year notes up   and basis points  respectively  while the year bond yield dipped basis points 
for the company  this has had a tightening effect on net interest margin and spread in the twelve month comparisons 
net interest margin for decreased basis points to from led by a basis point decline in net interest spread to from 
o on december   the company acquired citizens bancorp for million in a cash and stock transaction

citizens georgetown was acquired on july  and financial national electronic transfer  inc finet was acquired on october  the timing of these acquisitions generally increased reported income and expense line items in compared to line item increases attributed to these recent acquisitions are expected to level off once there are comparable periods in the future 
results of operations consolidated net income for was million  an increase of million or compared to million for basic and diluted net income per share were and  respectively  for the current twelve month period 
this represents an increase of 
or and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
the increase in net income for the twelve months ended december  is attributed to an increase in net interest income and a lower provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net noninterest expenses noninterest expenses in excess of noninterest income 
net interest income for the current twelve month period was million  an increase of million or compared to million for the same twelve months in the increase in net interest income can be attributed to higher interest income  primarily as a result of both loan growth and higher average interest rates earned on loans  which offset the increase in interest expense  primarily attributed to higher rates paid on deposits 
the return on assets roa was in  an increase of basis points from the prior year end 
the return on equity roe increased basis points to compared to in the prior year 
the increase in roe is a result of the million increase in net income and a basis point increase in financial leverage from to as of december  financial leverage represents the degree in which borrowed funds  as opposed to equity  are used in the funding of assets 
interest income interest income results from interest earned on earning assets  which primarily include loans and investment securities 
interest income is affected by volume average balance  composition of earning assets  and the related rates earned on those assets 
total interest income for was million  an increase of million or from the previous year 
interest income on loans increased as a result of higher outstanding loan balances coupled with a higher average rate earned 
the increase in average balances outstanding resulted from both the citizens georgetown and citizens northern acquisitions along with internally generated loan growth 
interest income on securities grew as a result of a higher average rate earned on the investments 
the company s tax equivalent yield on earning assets for the current year was  an increase of basis points compared to the same period a year ago 
interest and fees on loans was million  an increase of million or compared to a year earlier 
average loans increased million or to million in the comparison due to higher loan demand in what remains a low rate environment and  to a lesser extent  the loans acquired in the citizens georgetown and citizens northern acquisitions 
on july   the company purchased million in loans related to the citizens georgetown acquisition and on december  the company purchased million in loans related to the citizens northern acquisition 
in addition  a higher average rate earned on loans contributed nearly equally to the rise in interest income 
new loans and variable rate loans repricing during the current year have generally repriced higher as market interest rates have edged upward 
the tax equivalent yield on loans increased basis points to from in the annual comparison 
interest on taxable securities was million  an increase of thousand or due to an increase in the average rate earned 
the average rate earned on taxable securities increased basis points to from while the average balance declined million or to million 
taxable equivalent interest on nontaxable securities decreased thousand or due to a basis point lower average rate earned of from 
interest on short term investments  including time deposits in other banks  federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreements to resell  increased million due to an increase in both the average rate and balances outstanding of basis points and million  respectively 
interest expense interest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities  which primarily include interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other borrowed funds 
interest expense is affected by volume  composition of interest bearing liabilities  and the related rates paid on those liabilities 
total interest expense was million for  an increase of million or from the prior year 
interest expense increased as a result of higher average rates paid and higher average interest bearing liabilities outstanding 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was impacted by the citizens georgetown and citizens northern acquisitions 
the company purchased million and million in interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits  from citizens georgetown and citizens northern  respectively 
the company s cost of funds was for  an increase of basis points from for the prior year 
the higher cost of funds was led by a basis point increase in the average rate paid on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are reflective of the increase in short term market interest rates by the fed during the average rate paid for other interest bearing liabilities also moved upward as a result of the overall economic environment 
interest expense on time deposits  the largest component of total interest expense  increased million or to million 
the increase in interest expense on time deposits was equally attributed to a million increase in the average outstanding balance to million and a basis point increase in average rates paid to 
interest expense on savings deposits and interest bearing demand deposits increased thousand or and million  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to an increase in the average rate paid on savings and interest bearing demand deposits of basis points and basis points  respectively 
average savings deposits and interest bearing demand deposits increased million or and million or  respectively 
interest expense on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million or due to an increase in the average rate paid of basis points to 
the increase in rate is mainly due to the increase in short term market interest rates by the fed during interest expense on subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts was thousand during and is related to the private offerings of preferred securities through company sponsored trusts totaling million during july interest expense on other borrowed funds consists primarily of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
interest expense on other borrowed funds was relatively unchanged at million in compared to net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets 
the two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread represents the difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  which are also available to fund earning assets 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and the composition of earning assets  their related yields  and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and the average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin 
the table on the following page represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of tax equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of million or compared to million in the net interest margin was  a decline of basis points from in the prior year 
a decrease in the net interest spread accounts for basis points of the lower margin while the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funds offset the lower spread by basis points 
the effect of noninterest bearing sources of funds on net interest margin is reflective of an increasing overall interest rate environment 
the effect of noninterest bearing sources of funds on net interest margin typically increases in a rising rate environment 
during  the tax equivalent yield on total earning assets increased basis points to and the cost of funds increased by basis points to  resulting in the basis point decline in spread noted above 
although the cost of funds rose faster than the rate earned on earning assets  net interest income increased because earning assets are greater than interest bearing liabilities 
the tax equivalent spread between rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities totaled for compared to a year earlier 
the company remains proactive in management of the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities 
this task continues to be challenging due to competitive market factors and the effects of a dynamic interest rate environment  that is  however  still relatively low in a historical context 
beginning in  the fed increased the short term federal funds rate five times totaling basis points 
this trend continued throughout  with eight additional rate increases totaling basis points 
predicting the movement of future interest rates is uncertain 
during the past year  the average rates on the two most significant components of net interest income for the company  loans and time deposits  both increased 
should interest rates continue to increase  the company s cost of funds may also increase and could continue to increase faster than the yields on earning assets  resulting in even smaller net interest margins 
should interest rates on the company s earning assets and interest paying liabilities begin to decline  the company s yield on earning assets could potentially decrease faster than its cost of funds

these increases were boosted by the acquisition of citizens northern in december at year end  citizens northern had million of net loans  million of cash and cash equivalents  and million of goodwill

interest sensitivity in thousands fixed rate variable rate due after one but within five years   due after five years   total   asset quality the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio  limiting exposure to any single customer or industry  standard lending policies and underwriting criteria  and collateral requirements 
the company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner 
this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using a risk rated methodology 
many factors are considered when estimating the allowance 
these include  but are not limited to  past loan loss experience  an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the risk rated methodology includes segregating watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating specific reserves to these loans depending on their status 
for example  watch list loans  which may be identified by the internal loan review risk rating system or by regulatory examiner classification  are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due days or more are assigned a different loss percentage 
each of these percentages consider past experience as well as current factors 
the remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into three components having similar risk characteristics as follows commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate loans 
each of these components is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective three year historical loss percentage 
additional allocations to the allowance may then be made for subjective factors  such as those mentioned above  as determined by senior managers who are knowledgeable about these matters 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on the information currently available  additional adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in the factors noted above 
borrowers may experience difficulty in periods of economic deterioration  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require additional increases in the provision 
also  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews could result in additional adjustments to the provision based upon their judgments about relevant information available during their examination 
the provision for loan losses totaled thousand in  a decrease of million or compared to million for total net charge offs for the company decreased thousand or for year end compared to and were as follows for real estate lending thousand  installment loans million  lease financing thousand  and commercial  financial  and agricultural loans thousand 
the change in net charge offs for compared to were as follows commercial  financial  and agriculture decreased thousand or  real estate lending decreased thousand or  installment loans decreased thousand or  and lease financing increased thousand or 
the decline in commercial  financial  and agriculture loans and real estate loans charged off is attributed in part to the unusually high charge offs in the prior year related to the citizens georgetown acquisition 
the increase in charge offs related to lease financing is mainly attributed to a single credit in the manufacturing industry 
net charge offs equaled 
of average loans for  a decline of basis points compared to the prior year end 
the allowance for loan losses  which included an increase of million on december  as a result of the citizens northern acquisition  was million at year end and represented of loans net of unearned income at year end compared to at year end the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans totaled and at year end and  respectively 
management continues to emphasize collection efforts and evaluation of risks within the portfolio 
the composition of the company s loan portfolio continues to be diverse with no significant concentration to any individual or industry 
the table below summarizes the loan loss experience for the past five years 
years ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of year      acquisition of citizens bank kentucky  inc  acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc  loans charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural  real estate   installment loans to individuals     lease financing total loans charged off     recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate installment loans to individuals lease financing total recoveries net loans charged off     additions to allowance charged to expense   balance at end of year     average loans net of unearned income    ratio of net charge offs during year to average loans  net of unearned income 



the following table presents an estimate of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by type for the date indicated 
although specific allocations exist  the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any particular category 
allowance for loan losses december  in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural    real estate      installment loans to individuals     lease financing  total      nonperforming assets nonperforming assets for the company include nonperforming loans  other real estate owned  and other foreclosed assets 
nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days on which interest is still accruing  and restructured loans 
generally  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
nonperforming assets totaled million at year end  an increase of million or compared to the increase is primarily due to a million or increase in other real estate owned partially offset by a million decline in nonaccrual loans 
the increase in other real estate owned includes million of the underlying real estate collateral on a pool of loans to a financially troubled builder transferred to the company through foreclosure 
the decline in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by two extensions of credit secured by real estate 
one involves a balance of million to a financially trouble builder secured by multifamily residential real estate  the other relates to million secured by commercial real estate 
the underlying collateral securing the credit to the financially troubled builder was transferred to the company through foreclosure during the first quarter of the million commercial real estate credit was collected in the first quarter of nonperforming loans represent 
of loans net of unearned income at year end  a decrease of basis points from compared to year end information pertaining to nonperforming loans and assets is presented in the table below 
december  in thousands loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis    loans past due days or more and still accruing   total nonperforming loans     other real estate owned    other foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets    temporary investments temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   temporary investments were million  an increase of million or compared to million at year end in  temporary investments averaged million  an increase of million or from year end the increase is primarily a result of the company s net funding position  which was driven by an increase in average interest bearing deposits of million or million attributed to citizens northern and the impact of the million proceeds from the company s trust preferred securities offering during the third quarter of temporary investments are reallocated as loan demand and other investment alternatives present the opportunity 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  and tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions 
total investment securities were million on december   a decrease of million or from year end the funds made available from maturing or called bonds have been redirected as necessary to fund higher yielding loan growth  reinvested to purchase additional investment securities  or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored 
investment securities averaged million in total for the current year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in average investment securities occurred almost entirely in the taxable portfolio 
the decrease in average investment securities was driven by a million net decline in mortgage backed securities  which was partially offset by net additional purchases of us government agency securities averaging million during the current year 
the company had a net unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities of million at december  compared to a net unrealized gain of million at year end the million decrease in the current period is due primarily to the impact of changing economic conditions  including an increase in market interest rates  particularly short term rates  which have generally lowered the value of the investment portfolio at the end of the current period 
as overall market interest rates have moved upward during the current period  the portfolio has declined in value 
market values of fixed rate investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates 
on december   available for sale securities made up of the total investment securities  up from from a year earlier 
us government agencies were million and million at year end and  respectively 
this represents of the total available for sale securities and of the total portfolio at year end at year end  us government agencies made up of the total available for sale securities and of the total portfolio

the company realized thousand in net losses on the sale of available for sale investment securities during  a decrease of thousand compared to net realized gains of thousand during the decrease in net gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities was due to lower sales activity from normal asset liability management 
the following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on december    and the investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at the estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost

the calculation of the weighted average interest rates for each category is based on the weighted average costs of the securities 
the weighted average tax rates on exempt states and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
deposits the company s primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits  which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand  savings  and time deposits 
on december   deposits totaled billion  an increase of million or from year end the increase in deposits was due to a million or increase in interest bearing deposits coupled with a million or increase in noninterest bearing deposits 
the increase in interest bearing deposits include higher time deposits of million or  higher savings deposits of million or  and higher interest bearing demand deposits of million or 
the increase in each deposit category was mainly attributed to the citizens northern acquisition  which added million in interest bearing deposits at year end as follows time deposits million  savings deposits million  and interest bearing demand million 
end of period noninterest bearing deposits grew mainly as a result of the citizens northern acquisition  which added million in noninterest bearing deposits in the year to year comparison 
excluding the additional deposits related to the citizens northern acquisition  noninterest bearing deposits increased million or  with activity related to the commonwealth of kentucky deposits relatively unchanged

 maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are summarized as follows 
in thousands amount months or less  over through months  over through months  over months  total  short term borrowings short term borrowings primarily consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with year end balances of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
such borrowings are generally on an overnight basis 
other short term borrowings consist of fhlb borrowings totaling  million  and at year end   and  respectively  and demand notes issued to the us treasury under the treasury tax and loan note option account totaling thousand  thousand  and thousand in   and respectively 
a summary of short term borrowings is as follows 
in thousands amount outstanding at year end    maximum outstanding at any month end    average outstanding    weighted average rate during the year long term borrowings prior to  substantially all of the company s long term borrowings consisted of fhlb advances to the company s subsidiary banks 
these advances are secured by restricted holdings of fhlb stock that the banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the fhlb 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  which have their own interest rates and range of maturities 
interest rates on fhlb advances are generally fixed and range between and  with a weighted average rate of  and maturities of up to years 
approximately million of the total long term advances from the fhlb are convertible to a floating interest rate 
these advances may convert to a floating interest rate indexed to three month libor only if libor equals or exceeds 
at year end  the three month libor was 
fhlb advances are generally used to increase the company s lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the fhlb 
long term advances from the fhlb totaled million at december   a decrease of million or from year end in july  the company completed two private offerings of trust preferred securities through two separate delaware statutory trusts sponsored by the company 
farmers capital bank trust i trust i sold million of preferred securities and farmers capital bank trust ii trust ii sold million of preferred securities trust i and trust ii are hereafter collectively referred to as the trusts 
the proceeds from the offering were used to fund the cash portion of the citizens bancorp acquisition 
the company owns all of the common securities of each of the trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  plus capital contributed to establish the trusts  to purchase the company s junior subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities 
the subordinated notes mature in and bear a floating interest rate current three month libor plus basis points in the case of the notes held by trust i and current three month libor plus basis points in the case of the notes held by trust ii 
interest on the notes is payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after september  and mature on september  the notes are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness 
at december   the balance of the subordinated notes payable to trust i and trust ii was million and million respectively 
the interest rates in effect as of the last determination date in were and for trust i and trust ii  respectively 
contractual obligations the company is contractually obligated to make payments as follows 
payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt      subordinated notes payable   operating leases   capital lease obligations total      long term fhlb debt represents fhlb advances pursuant to several different credit programs 
long term fhlb debt and subordinated notes payable are more fully described under the caption long term borrowings above and in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
capital lease obligations represent amounts relating to the acquisition of various data processing hardware and software 
operating leases include standard business equipment used in the company s day to day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites 
operating lease terms generally range from one to five years  with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the company s option 
effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business 
the company has a corporate asset and liability management committee alco 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
alco also provides guidance and support to each alco of the company s subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company wide basis 
alco has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt 
however  the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the corporate policy 
the company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure 
the model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates during the next twelve months 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes  including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities 
other assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected prepayments  projected new volume  and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances 
these effects are combined with the company s estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months 
the forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and net income 
because assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income 
actual results could differ significantly from simulated results 
at december   the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would increase and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
the model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would decrease and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
in the current low interest rate environment  it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets 
the average rate paid on some of the company s deposits remains below 
this situation magnifies the model s predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates  as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower rate deposits 
liquidity the company uses a liquidity ratio to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs 
this ratio is monitored by alco at both the bank level and on a consolidated basis 
the liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds 
this measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results 
for example  a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the company s ability to fund loans might become more difficult 
a high liquidity ratio could indicate that the company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets  which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand 
the company s liquidity position at year end is relatively unchanged from year end  is within alco guidelines  and considered by management to be at an appropriate level 
at the parent company level  liquidity is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements and cash balances maintained 
the parent company s primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to shareholders  repurchasing its common stock  business acquisitions  interest expense on borrowings  and paying for general operating expenses 
the primary source of funds for the parent company is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks 
as of december   combined retained earnings of the subsidiary banks were million  of which million was available for the payment of dividends to the parent company without obtaining prior approval from bank regulatory agencies 
as a practical matter  payment of future dividends is also subject to the maintenance of other capital ratio requirements 
management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the parent company 
in addition  the parent company has a million unsecured line of credit with an unrelated financial institution available for general corporate purposes 
this line of credit has not been drawn upon and will mature on august  the parent company had cash balances of million at year end  an increase of million or from the prior year end 
the increase in cash at the parent company is due primarily to cash proceeds from the trust preferred securities offering during which was used to fund the cash portion of the citizens bancorp acquisition subsequent to december  other significant cash flows of the parent company include the receipt of million in dividends from its subsidiaries and the payment of million in dividend to its shareholders 
this compares to million in dividends received from subsidiaries and million in dividends paid to shareholders during each of the company s subsidiary banks continued to maintain well capitalized status as defined by the fdic subsequent to their dividend payments 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds include the subsidiary banks core deposits  consisting of both business and nonbusiness deposits  cash flow generated by repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities  fhlb borrowings  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition in our local markets 
as of december   the company had million in additional borrowing capacity under various fhlb  federal funds  and other borrowing agreements 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
the company s alcos  both at the bank subsidiary level and on a consolidated basis  meet regularly and monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
liquid assets consist of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investment securities 
at december   liquid assets totaled million  a million or increase compared to the prior year end 
cash and equivalents increased million or coupled with a slight increase in available for sale investment securities of thousand or 
in the comparison 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due mainly to the overall net funding position of the company  which changes as loan demand  deposit levels  and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million or from million in the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities was million during compared to million a year earlier 
the million difference in the comparison is attributed mainly to a decrease in net loans originated for investment of million and the company s acquisition activity of million 
during  the company purchased citizens georgetown and finet with a net cash outflow of million and million  respectively 
during  the company purchased citizens bancorp in which a significant amount of the cash purchase price was paid during this resulted in a net cash inflow during of million 
in addition  the company paid thousand in additional costs related to its prior year acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year this compares to net cash used in financing activities during of million 
this represents an increase in cash flows of million in the comparison and is due primarily to the trust preferred securities offering of million during  a net increase in internally generated deposit activity of million  and a million net increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase activity during the current year as compared to a year earlier 
information relating to off balance sheet arrangements  which for the company comprise of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  is disclosed in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the company s liquidity position 
the company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options  or similar instruments 
capital resources shareholders equity was million on december  this represents an increase of million or from year end due mainly to million in stock issued in connection with the citizens bancorp acquisition 
retained earnings grew million or due to million in net income offset by million in dividends declared 
accumulated other comprehensive loss  consisting of net unrealized holding losses on available for sale securities net of tax  was million at december   a decrease of million from an unrealized gain of thousand at year end the decrease in the current period is due primarily to the impact of changing economic conditions  including an increase in market interest rates  particularly short term rates  which have generally lowered the value of the investment portfolio at the end of the current period 
as overall market interest rates have moved upward during the current period  the portfolio has declined in value 
market values of fixed rate investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates 
consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company s goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements 
the company s capital ratios as of december   the regulatory minimums  and the regulatory standard for a well capitalized institution are as follows

the general trend of the interest rate environment for was downward primarily as a result of short term interest rate reductions taken by the fed 
the effects of the downward trend in general interest rates for positively affect the company s net interest income during a significant amount of time deposits  the largest component of interest bearing liabilities  repriced to lower rates and contributed to an increase in net interest income for the the repricing of time deposits for the company have generally taken longer to occur than for other interest paying liabilities and interest earning assets due to their fixed nature and maturity characteristics 
during the last half of  the trend in short term interest rates began to move upward as the short term federal funds rate was increased basis points in five increments of basis points each by the fed 
these rate increases did not significantly impact the company s net interest income during since basis points of the increase occurred between september and year end item a
