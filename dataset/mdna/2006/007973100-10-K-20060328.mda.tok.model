for a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward looking statements  see item a risk factors within part i of this form k 
executive summary our sales in were million  a decrease from sales in of million 
the decrease in our sales principally reflects a downturn in spending in the semiconductor  semiconductor capital equipment  and flat panel display industries 
in  we completed the transition of our high volume manufacturing to our shenzhen  china facility for all product platforms originally identified for transfer to shenzhen 
we also continued our transition to lower cost asian suppliers 
the elimination of the duplicative costs incurred throughout the transition  the benefit of reduced manufacturing costs in china  and the reduced costs experienced through increased purchasing from asian suppliers have positively contributed to our results of operations in compared to and our gross margin increased to in from in and in our gross margin in was negatively impacted by significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million 
we also completed the sale of million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering and realized approximately million in net proceeds  which we used towards the full redemption of our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million 
as a result  we eliminated substantially all of our long term debt and interest expense 
our net income from continuing operations for was million  compared to a net loss in of million  and a net loss of million in the improvement in from and was principally due to the elimination of the duplicative operating and logistics costs associated with our operational restructuring  focus on material cost reductions  the significantly reduced excess and obsolete inventory charges attributable to improved product life cycle management  and the refocusing of our research and development activities 
the improvement from to occurred despite the decrease in our sales 

table of contents in  we made a strategic decision to focus our management attention and spending on our core operations 
as a result  we sold our emco and ikor product lines  as these lines were not considered critical to our core operations 
our income from discontinued operations was million in  comprised of a million gain on the sale of discontinued operations and million related to the operating results of discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in and million in  representing the operating results of operations reclassified from continuing operations 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain data as a percentage of sales extracted from our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative litigation settlement restructuring charges impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss sales the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by customer type for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands semiconductor capital equipment flat panel display data storage advanced product applications years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment flat panel display data storage advanced product applications 
table of contents the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by geographic region for each of the three years in the period ended december  the following amounts do not contemplate where our customers may subsequently transfer our products 
years ended december  in thousands united states europe asia rest of world years ended december  united states europe asia rest of world total sales were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease of from to and a increase from to the growth from to was due primarily to a recovery from downturns in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  and continued growth of the flat panel display industry 
the decrease from to principally reflects a decline in demand in the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel display and data storage industries  partially offset by an increase in demand in the advanced product applications  particularly applications dependent upon industrial coatings 
we expect that these industries will recover slightly in the near term  but have no clear visibility for all of the semiconductor capital equipment industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which have consistently represented approximately of our total sales  increased by approximately from to  and then declined by approximately from to  due largely to fluctuating demand 
our sales to our largest semiconductor capital equipment customers represented the majority of the fluctuating sales volume 
applied materials is our largest customer and accounted for of our sales in  in and in our ten largest customers accounted for of our total sales in  in and in our sales to the flat panel display industry increased million  or from to  and then decreased million  or  from to our sales to the data storage industry increased million  or from to  and then decreased million  or  from to the increases in sales from to followed by the decreases from to in these industries are primarily attributed to fluctuating demand 
ulvac  inc  our largest customer in the flat panel display industry  accounted for of our sales in  and less than in and sales for advanced product applications have been steadily increasing  which we attribute primarily to the general expansion of applications dependent upon industrial coatings 
our advanced product application sales increased million  or from to  and increased million  or  from to looking forward to  there is no assurance that our revenue will remain consistent with  or increase from  the levels experienced during changes in the macroeconomic environment  semiconductor supply and demand  and other changes that are beyond our control introduce significant uncertainty into our forecasts 
gross margin our gross margin was in  in and in the improvement in our gross margin is attributed to the completion of our high volume manufacturing transition to china  lowering of our worldwide logistics costs  product portfolio management  supplier transitions and design led cost reductions  offset by the impact of the lower sales base 
the decline in gross margin from to was primarily due to lower average selling prices than anticipated  increasing manufacturing costs at the shenzhen facility as production of more product lines was transferred and customers began accepting products from such facility  without equivalent decreases in manufacturing and facilities costs at our fort collins facility impact of approximately basis points  high demand during for product lines with relatively low margins  and excess and obsolete inventory charges during the fourth quarter of resulting from changes in our product life cycle management program  
table of contents discontinuance of certain products in select markets  the product mix shift from mm wafers to mm wafers and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry in the near term 
our gross margin in was positively impacted by percentage points  due to our discontinuance of the allocation of human resource and finance department costs to cost of sales 
as part of our significant operational restructuring  we have reviewed all aspects of our management reporting and determined that the continued allocation of such costs was no longer appropriate 
in  these costs are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
human resource and finance department costs included in our gross margin represented percentage points in and percentage points in our gross margins during these years have been adversely affected principally by the following factors the lower sales bases in and caused in large part by downturns in the semiconductor equipment industry  resulting in lower absorption of our fixed costs  during our transition of high volume manufacturing to shenzhen  from to mid  we had been required to operate manufacturing facilities in both shenzhen and fort collins to produce the same products  which required duplicate management  procurement and engineering teams  as well as facilities costs  increased shipping and related costs for products manufactured in our shenzhen facility during our manufacturing transition  lower average selling prices  high demand for two product groups with margins lower than our corporate average  charges for excess and obsolete inventory were approximately million in  million in and million in the charge was primarily due to changes in our product life cycle management program  discontinuance of certain products in select markets  the product mix shift from mm wafers to mm wafers and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry in the near term 
the charge was primarily due to a reduced sales outlook and a management decision to discontinue certain product offerings 
due to the highly customized nature of our inventory  minimal quantities of reserved inventory are subsequently sold  and therefore subsequent sales of this inventory have not had a material impact on our gross margin 
the reserved inventory is typically disposed of when it is determined that no possible future use could arise  and warranty costs of approximately million in  million in and million in factors that could cause our gross margins to be negatively impacted in and beyond include  but are not limited to the following decrease in average selling prices  unanticipated costs related to our recent transition to china manufacturing and continuing move to lower cost asian suppliers  cost reduction programs initiated by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers that negatively impact our average selling price  warranty costs in excess of historical rates and our expectations  freight costs in excess of historical rates and our expectations  increased levels of excess and obsolete inventory  either due to market conditions  the introduction of new products by our competitors  or our decision to discontinue certain product lines  impact of our adoption of the stock based compensation expensing provisions of sfas r  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates that might affect our costs 

table of contents research and development the market for our subsystems for vacuum process systems and related accessories is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new highly differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support oem requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses have decreased to in  from in and in the decrease from to was due primarily to the higher sales base in the decrease from to is primarily due to less engineering support needed in connection with the transition of high volume product manufacturing to china  prioritization of our research and development projects and increased scrutiny of our costs 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  patent  tax  financial  corporate governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in and then increased to in the percentage decrease from to was due to the increasing sales base and our cost reduction measures  including the closures of certain locations  partially offset by an increase in selling expense in of million due to a change in an accounting estimate related to our demonstration equipment described below 
in dollar terms  sg a expenses decreased from to due primarily to the benefit of our cost reduction measures and decreased commissions  partially offset by the increased allocation of certain costs from cost of sales to sg a expenses discussed above 
as a percentage of sales  the increase from to is primarily attributed to the decreased sales base 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our demonstration equipment program was structured to enable our customers or potential customers to evaluate equipment in order to facilitate sales 
under this program  we amortized our demonstration equipment based on its originally estimated useful life of two years 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated this program and determined that it was not achieving the desired results  primarily in terms of the ultimate sale of the demonstration equipment 
as a result  we shifted our focus from selling the demonstration equipment to utilizing the equipment for achieving design wins with our major customers and significant potential customers  with the demonstration equipment used solely as a sales and marketing tool and with no subsequent efforts to sell the equipment 
based upon these changes  specifically our decision not to expend resources to realize sales value from the demonstration equipment currently in the field  we wrote off the net book value of the demonstration equipment 
subsequently  our practice has been to expense our demonstration equipment to sg a in the period in which it is given to our customer or potential customer 
this change has not had a continuing material impact on our operating results 
patent litigation expenses from through have comprised a portion of our sg a expenses 
in addition to the litigation settlement paid to mks instruments  inc mks as described below  we have recorded legal fees and expenses related to litigation with mks and others of approximately to of our total sg a expenses for each of the three years in the period ended december  litigation settlement on october   we executed a settlement agreement with mks  resolving all pending claims worldwide relating to our xstream with active matching network reactive gas generator products 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we paid mks million in cash 
we also stipulated to a final judgment of infringement and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering to sell  or importing into the united states  or any country in which a counterpart patent exists  our xstream products and all other toroidal plasma generator products  except as permitted under the settlement agreement 
sales of these products have accounted for less than of our total sales each year since introduction of the products 
restructuring charges at the end of  we announced major changes in our operations planned to occur through these included establishing the manufacturing location in china  consolidating worldwide sales forces  a move to lower cost asian suppliers  and the intention to close or sell certain facilities 
associated with these changes  we have recorded restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in 
table of contents the charges consisted of the recognition of expense for involuntary employee termination benefits for employees in our united states operations  voluntary employee termination benefits  primarily in our japanese operations for employees  and asset impairments incurred as a result of closing our longmont  co manufacturing facilities 
our restructuring charges throughout and were incurred primarily in conjunction with our transition of our high volume manufacturing to shenzhen  china  which was substantially complete as of september  in  we recorded million of restructuring charges  primarily attributable to employee severance and termination costs for employees in the fort collins facility 
related to this operations restructuring  and the transition of certain product lines from certain of our locations in europe and japan  we recorded restructuring charges in of million  consisting primarily of million for employee severance and termination costs and  for impairments of facilities related assets in the united states and japan  as a result of consolidation of certain of our facilities 
the employee severance and termination costs were associated with employees in the united states  employees in europe and three employees in japan 
with the exception of one employee in the united states  all of these employee severance and termination costs have been paid as of december  we expect to pay the remaining accrual for employee severance and termination costs of approximately  by the end of the first quarter of the remaining facility closing liability is expected to be paid over the remaining lease term expiring at the end of and is reflected net of expected sublease income of  additional charges and cash requirements may be required in the future if the expected sublease income is not realized 
we originally estimated that upon completion of the transfer of high volume manufacturing to china  we would expect to save approximately million to million annually in labor and related costs when compared to what the costs would have been prior to the transition at similar production volumes 
the expected savings were anticipated to be approximately million in costs of sales  approximately million in sg a and approximately million in research and development 
we continue to believe that our annual savings as a result of our high volume manufacturing transition to china will approximate these amounts  which we began to realize in the second half of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter 
however  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we perform tests for impairment of these assets and record impairment charges  as necessary 
such events or circumstances include downturns or anticipated downturns in the industries in which we serve  changes in customer technology requirements  and other changes in circumstances affecting the underlying value of the recorded asset 
we did not record any impairment charges of our amortizable intangible assets in we recorded amortizable intangible asset impairment charges totaling million in and million in during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our financial forecasting for future periods  it was evident that projected cash flows from certain customers of the dressler product line were substantially below amounts previously projected 
the projected cash flows were considered in determining the fair value of certain contract based and other amortizable intangible assets recorded at acquisition and also in subsequent periods to assess such assets for potential impairment 
due to the decline in projected cash flows  we performed assessments of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets 
these assessments consisted of estimating the intangible asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value through the use of projected cash flows based upon projected revenue streams over the life of the asset  discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the respective carrying values  and recorded impairment charges of approximately million  which has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
also during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our restructuring plan  employees who were the subject of certain contract based amortizable intangibles left the company or their responsibilities were significantly altered 
as a result  we performed assessments of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets 
these assessments consisted of estimating the intangible asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value through the use of a lost profits method of determining the fair value  arriving at projected cash flows which were then discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the respective carrying values  and recorded impairment charges of approximately  which has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we determined that one of our mass flow controller products would not conform to changing customer technology requirements  and as such would no longer be accepted by our customers 
as a result  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of the related intangible asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value by applying a hypothetical royalty rate to the projected revenue stream and using a cash flow model discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair value of the intangible asset was minimal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which has also been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million in and million in and the increase in interest income from the and periods was due to our higher level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for most of the year prior to our redemption of the convertible subordinated notes  increasing interest rates  and our investing the million in net proceeds from our public offering of million shares prior to our use of those proceeds to redeem our convertible subordinated notes 
portions of the proceeds were held by us  up to days 
we expect interest income in future periods to decrease due to our lower combined cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances resulting from the use of cash to redeem our convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense consisted principally of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  on borrowings under capital lease facilities and senior debt  and amortization of our deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased slightly from to due to the repayment of approximately million of senior borrowings and capital leases during  offset in part by a new borrowing of approximately million 
interest expense decreased million from to due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million and our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million in september due to the redemption of all our convertible subordinated notes by the end of the third quarter of  quarterly interest expense and amortized debt issuance costs of approximately million has been eliminated 
our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of  in  million in and  in debt extinguishment expense of million resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million 
the expense of million is comprised of million for redemption premium and million for the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
net other income expense consists principally of miscellaneous gains and losses  including gains and losses on the sale of investments and impairments of investments 
we recorded net other income of  in and million in we recorded net other expense of  in provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
since  we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have incurred significant losses 
given such experience  management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets will be realized 
while there may be indications that our operating results may improve in future periods  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 in evaluating the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  is required to place greater weight on our historical results as compared to projections regarding future taxable income 
if we generate future taxable income  or should we be able to conclude that sufficient taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations  in the appropriate tax jurisdictions  against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense will be reported in such period 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
from through  we have only reversed portions of such valuation allowances for which we have realized the underlying asset 
the income tax provision of million for represented an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
on the loss from continuing operations  the income tax provision of million for represented an effective tax rate of negative and the income tax provision of million for represented an effective tax rate of negative 
the fluctuation in our effective tax rate from period to period is due to the fluctuations in our taxable income by jurisdiction 
despite the consolidated loss from continuing operations earned in and  taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions resulted in a consolidated provision for income taxes 
the income from our discontinued operations was earned in the united states 
no provision for income taxes is attributed to these discontinued operations  due to the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the united states  including those generated by net operating losses 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in 
table of contents future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
for the year ended december   no valuation allowances established in purchase accounting were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to the benefit from stock based compensation 
any reversal of valuation allowance from this item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million in  million in and million in in  we sold the assets of our emco product line and our ikor product line  as they were not critical to our core operations 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the emco product line of million and a gain on the sale of the ikor product line of million 
because the emco product line has not represented a significant portion of our operations  with revenues representing of annual consolidated sales in  in and through its sale on june   and represents an insignificant portion of our operating results for all periods presented  we have not reclassified the results of operations of the emco product line to income from discontinued operations 
the results of operations of the ikor product line have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations  which results include income of million in  million in and million in no provision for income taxes is attributed to these operations due to the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the united states  as the income from our discontinued operations was earned in the united states 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

pretax charges in the fourth quarter included million to cost of sales for increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves  million to selling  general and administrative for the change in estimate of the useful life of the demonstration equipment see note within part ii  item  million to restructuring for employee severance and termination costs primarily attributable to the fort collins facility see note within part ii  item  million to impairment of intangible assets see note within part ii  item 
these items contributed significantly to our fourth quarter results 
we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter of as a result of the fourth quarter strategic management decision to discontinue certain product offerings  the outlook for near term demand  the declining trend in our sales from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry in the near term 

table of contents our loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of included pretax charges of million for debt extinguishment expenses see note within part ii  item and million for a litigation settlement see note within part ii  item 
due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment industry as well as the other industries in which our customers operate  and the sudden changes resulting in severe downturns and upturns  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our levels of operating expenditures are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues that such expenses support 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding at december  borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement are limited based upon letters of credit outstanding under this agreement and the lenders borrowing base calculation  which considers among other factors  our accounts receivable and inventory balances 
advances under the revolving line of credit would bear interest at the prime rate at march  minus 
any advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in july we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  net worth  acquisitions and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  we have historically financed our operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  the issuance of long term debt and common stock  bank loans  capital lease obligations and operating leases 
during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes for million  offset by the million of net proceeds from our public offering of million shares of common stock and million of net cash provided by operating activities 
operating activities provided cash of million in  which is the first annual period since in which cash was generated from operating activities 
operating activities used cash of million in and million in the generation of cash in is attributed to our improved operating results  namely our manufacturing and operating expense reductions and sell through of inventory  despite the lower sales volume 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which primarily consisted of the net sale of marketable securities of million used to redeem a portion of the convertible subordinated notes 
cash provided by investing activities in also reflects million received on the sale of our ikor product line and million on the sale of our emco product line  offset in part by million used for the purchase of property and equipment 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which primarily consisted of million from proceeds on the net sale of marketable securities  offset by million for the purchase of property and equipment 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily attributed to million of property and equipment purchases offset by million of proceeds on the net sale of marketable securities 
with the significant capital expenditures related to our investment in our manufacturing operations as well as our information technology infrastructure  we expect to reduce our capital expenditures in to approximately million 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions as our business experiences sudden changes 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly impact our capital expenditures in a particular period 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our current operations  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
financing activities used cash of million in  primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes offset in part by our public offering of common stock 
during the third quarter of  we raised million in net proceeds from a public offering of million shares of common stock 
with these proceeds we fully redeemed the convertible subordinated notes due november  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment   for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
after the redemption of the convertible subordinate notes  proceeds of approximately million remained 
these proceeds together with approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were used to redeem the convertible subordinated notes due september  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment  million for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
as a result  we expect to save approximately million of cash interest expense quarterly 
financing activities used cash of million in and million in  which primarily consisted of payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and in proceeds of a senior borrowing used to purchase a building in south korea 

table of contents we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our payments under capital lease obligations and senior borrowings may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or change the level of our bank financing 
our estimated payments under senior borrowings during will be approximately million 
a significant portion of these obligations are held in countries other than the united states  therefore  future foreign currency fluctuations  especially between the united states dollar and the japanese yen  could cause significant fluctuations in our estimated payment obligations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payments due under significant off balance sheet arrangements and long term debt obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total senior borrowings operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations total obligations please refer to note senior borrowings  note commitments and contingencies and note related party transactions included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding our significant off balance sheet arrangements  long term debt and capital lease obligations 
our inventory purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments we entered into to ensure we have an adequate supply of critical components to meet the demand of our customers 
we believe that these inventory purchases will be consumed in our on going operations within one year of purchase 
we believe that our working capital  together with cash anticipated to be generated by operations and borrowing capability under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes under part ii  item of this form k and believe that our accounting policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  are most critical as they relate to our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our standard shipping term is freight on board fob shipping point  for which revenue is recognized upon shipment of products  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
for certain customers  the company has fob destination terms  for which revenue is recognized upon receipt of the products by the customer  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from contracts that contain customer acceptance provisions are deferred until customer acceptance occurs 
generally  we do not have obligations to our customers after our products are shipped under fob shipping point terms  after our products are received by customers under fob destination terms  and after our products are accepted by customers under contractual acceptance provisions  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in limited instances  we provide installation of our products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item  generally the product  and the undelivered item  installation  based on their respective fair values 
revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed 
revenue deferrals are reported as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
in certain instances  we require our customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to our building or shipping these products 
cash payments received prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets  and then recognized as revenue as appropriate based upon the shipping terms of the products 
we do not offer price protections to our customers or allow returns  unless covered by our normal policy for repair of defective products 
warranty policy we offer warranty coverage for our products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is 
table of contents based on estimates 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally due to engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable value of inventory based primarily upon forecasts of product demand 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded  as necessary  within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation at december   we had three active stock based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note within part ii  item we account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
apb opinion no 
requires the use of the intrinsic value method  which measures compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
all options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  therefore no compensation cost related to such options is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we began issuing restricted stock units  compensation cost for which is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we make disclosures of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied to all stock based compensation as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure see note within part ii  item 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation  as of january   as further discussed under the heading new accounting pronouncements under note within part ii  item the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations as we will be required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations rather than disclose the impact on our results of operations within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business see item within part i and note within part ii  item 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies  including litigation  when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the tax rates expected in the period that the assets or liabilities are realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and income projections for each jurisdiction 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to periodic at least annual tests for impairment 
for the periods presented  we did not have any indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i we assess goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit with the carrying value  and ii if potential impairment is indicated because the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and institutional money markets 
these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
interest 
table of contents rate risk on our investment portfolio has decreased since with the decrease in our marketable securities balance  which is primarily attributable to the use of these funds in operations and for the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes 
we believe that a decrease in average interest rates on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the interest rates on the borrowings of our foreign subsidiaries are variable and as of december  ranged from to 
due to the relatively low amount of our variable rate obligations  we believe a increase in average interest rates on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we have entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  south korean won and chinese yuan 
the notional amount of our foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to the underlying assets 
at december  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts  maturing through january  primarily to purchase united states dollars and sell various foreign currencies 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contracts as of december  market notional settlement unrealized amounts amounts loss gain in thousands japanese yen contracts taiwanese dollar contract south korean won contract chinese yuan contract balance at december  we also have long term non united states dollar denominated debt of million as of december  and million as of december  a weakening of the united states dollar by against the applicable asian currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately  as of december  and  as of december  we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations when we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars
