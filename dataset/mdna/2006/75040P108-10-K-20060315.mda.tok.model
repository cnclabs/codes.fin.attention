item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview for  our net broadcast revenue continued to outpace the growth of the radio industry 
however  overall industry growth remains stagnant 
we remain concerned about the state of the radio industry 
as a result  we will continue to be prudent with respect to our radio acquisition strategy  and will continue to monitor our cost growth very closely 
competition from digital audio players  the internet and satellite radio  to name a few  is one of the primary reasons the radio industry has seen such slow growth over the past few years 
advertisers have shifted their advertising budgets away from traditional media such as newspapers  broadcast television and radio to new media forms 
additionally  internet companies have evolved from being large sources of advertising revenue for radio companies in the late s  to being significant competitors for advertising dollars 
all of these dynamics present significant challenges for companies such as ours as we look to maintain our listener levels and find new sources of revenue 
we remain hopeful that the radio industry will see some signs of recovery in whether or not such recovery occurs  we intend to build a company that will provide advertisers and creators of content a multifaceted way to reach african american consumers 
results of operations revenue we primarily derive revenue from the sale of advertising time and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers 
advertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
these rates are largely based upon a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  the number of radio stations in the related market  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
in february  we acquired of the common stock of reach media  inc reach media 
reach media primarily derives revenue from the sale of advertising time on the affiliate stations  which broadcast the tom joyner morning show 
the affiliate radio stations provide reach media with advertising inventory on their stations  which is then sold to the marketplace through a sales representative agreement with abc radio networks 
abc radio networks guarantees reach media an agreed upon amount of annual revenue  with the potential to earn additional amounts if certain revenue goals are met 
the agreement with abc radio networks runs through additional revenue is generated by reach media from special events  sponsorships  its internet business and other related activities 
during the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was generated from local advertising and approximately was generated from national advertising  including network advertising 
in comparison  during the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was generated from local advertising and approximately was generated from national advertising  including network advertising 
the change in the revenue mix is primarily due to the consolidation of the march through december operating results of reach media 
the balance of revenue was generated primarily from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to our sponsored events  management fees and other revenue 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue for our spot inventory  we monitor and limit the use of trade agreements 
expenses our significant broadcast expenses are i employee salaries and commissions  ii programming expenses  iii advertising and promotion expenses  iv rental of premises for office facilities and studios  v rental of transmission tower space and vi music license royalty fees 
we strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources  management information systems  and the overall programming management function 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase our audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore the effect on advertising revenue  tends to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures 
measurement of performance we monitor and evaluate the growth and operational performance of our business using net income and the following key metrics a net broadcast revenue the performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net broadcast revenue 
net broadcast revenue consists of gross broadcast revenue net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions  consistent with industry practice 
net broadcast revenue is recognized in the period in which advertisements are broadcast 
net broadcast revenue also includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services  which is recorded at fair value 
b station operating income net income before depreciation and amortization  income taxes  interest income  interest expense  equity in loss of affiliated company  minority interest in income of subsidiary  other income  corporate expenses  excluding non cash compensation and non cash compensation expenses is commonly referred to in our industry as station operating income 
station operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless  we believe station operating income is often a useful measure of a broadcasting company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our stations within the various markets because station operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations apart from expenses associated with our physical plant  income taxes provision  investments  debt financings  overhead and non cash compensation 
station operating income is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of station operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
station operating income does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance 
c station operating income margin station operating income margin represents station operating income as a percentage of net broadcast revenue 
station operating income margin is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless  we believe that station operating income margin is a useful measure of our performance because it provides helpful information about our profitability as a percentage of our net broadcast revenue 
d ebitda net income before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our industry as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our acquisitions and debt financings  and our provision for tax expense 
accordingly  we believe that ebitda provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance

this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net broadcast revenue  partially offset by higher operating expenses as described above 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda is provided on page liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and  to the extent necessary  commitments available under our credit facilities and other debt or equity financings 
in june  we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the term of the credit agreement is seven years and the total amount available under the credit agreement is million  consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility 
borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with provisions of the credit agreement  including but not limited to  financial covenants 
we may use proceeds from the credit facilities for working capital  capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of business  our common stock repurchase program  direct and indirect investments permitted under the credit agreement  and other lawful corporate purposes 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that we must comply with  including a maintaining a ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense of no less than to  b maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt for borrowed money to consolidated adjusted ebitda of no greater than to from june  to september   and no greater than to beginning october  and thereafter  c limitations on liens  d limitations on the sale of assets  e limitations on the payment of dividends  and f limitations on mergers  as well as other customary covenants 
simultaneous with entering into the credit agreement  we borrowed million under the credit agreement to retire all outstanding obligations under our previous credit agreement  dated as of july  the previous credit agreement provided for borrowings up to million  and consisted of a million term facility and a million revolving facility 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing 
taking into consideration the covenants under the credit agreement  approximately million of that amount is available to be drawn down 
both the term loan facility and the revolving facility under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread that ranges from to  or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
we also pay a commitment fee that varies depending on certain financial covenants and the amount of unused commitment  up to a maximum of per annum on the average balance of the revolving facility 
we believe that we are in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement in june  we a recorded approximately million of deferred financing costs to be amortized over the life of the credit agreement  and b wrote off approximately million of the previous credit facilities unamortized deferred financing costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
under our credit agreement  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
as a result  we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that the bank pays to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we have four swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million  and the periods remaining on these swap agreements range in duration from to months 
our credit exposure under these swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation 
the following table summarizes the interest rates in effect with respect to our debt as of december  excluding capital leases amount applicable type of debt outstanding interest rate in millions senior bank term debt swap matures june  senior bank term debt swap matures june  senior bank term debt swap matures june  senior bank term debt swap matures june  senior bank term debt subject to variable interest rates senior bank revolving debt subject to variable interest rates senior subordinated notes fixed rate senior subordinated notes fixed rate a total of million is subject to fixed rate swap agreements that became effective in june under our fixed rate swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate plus a spread based on our leverage ratio  as defined in our credit agreement 
that spread is currently set at and is incorporated into the applicable interest rates set forth above 
subject to rolling day libor plus a spread currently at and incorporated into the applicable interest rate set forth above 
in february  we completed the private placement of million senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded approximately million in deferred offering costs  which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the related notes using the effective interest rate method 
the net proceeds of the offering  in addition to borrowings of million under our previous revolving credit facility  and available cash  were primarily used to redeem our outstanding high tides in an amount of million 
in october  the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for an equal amount of notes registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
in may  we completed the private placement of million senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded approximately million in deferred offering costs  which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our credit facilities and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in november  the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for an equal amount of notes registered under the securities act 
our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes require that we comply with certain financial covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt 
such terms also place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  consolidation and mergers  and the issuance of equity interests  among other things 
our credit agreement also requires compliance with financial tests based on financial position and results of operations  including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  all of which could effectively limit our ability to borrow under the credit agreement or to otherwise raise funds in the debt markets 
the following table provides a comparison of our statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in from financing activities net cash flows from operating activities were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  declined from the prior year primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from a change to our capital structure 
this change in capital structure occurred in february  when we redeemed all of our outstanding high tides in an amount of million 
this redemption was financed with the net proceeds of the sale of the company s senior subordinated notes  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and available cash 
the result of the change is that we now pay interest expense  instead of dividends on our high tides 
the additional interest expense from the change in our capital structure is reflected in operating activities  whereas the dividends on our high tides were reflected in financing activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we acquired of the common stock of reach media for approximately million in a combination of approximately million of cash and  shares of our class d common stock  and we sold short term marketable securities for approximately million 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed the acquisition of the assets of wrnb fm formerly wsnj fm in the philadelphia market for approximately million  the acquisition of kroi fm formerly krts fm in the houston market for approximately million  and acquired new mableton broadcasting corporation nmbc  which owned wamj fm  a radio station located in the atlanta market for million 
we also completed the acquisition of wpzs fm formerly wabz fm in the charlotte market for approximately million 
also in  we made a cash contribution of approximately million towards our overall funding commitment of million to tv one  and sold short term marketable securities for approximately million 
for the year ended december   our capital expenditures were approximately million 
net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to net cash flows from financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we made a principal payment of million on our previous term loan  paid approximately million of amounts outstanding under our previous credit facilities with proceeds from our new revolving facility  borrowed million from our new revolving facility in connection with our stock repurchase program  repurchased shares of class a and class d common stock for approximately million  realized net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of million senior subordinated notes due  borrowed million under our previous revolving credit facility  redeemed our outstanding high tides in an amount of million  received approximately million from our stock subscriptions receivable and paid dividends on our high tides of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we made principal payments of million on our previous term loan 
we borrowed million from our previous revolver to complete the acquisition of kroi fm formerly krts fm and also borrowed million to complete the acquisition of the outstanding stock of nmbc 
also in the year ended december   we paid preferred dividends of approximately million on our high tides 
we continuously review opportunities to acquire additional radio stations  primarily in the top african american markets  and to make strategic investments 
in february  we signed an agreement to acquire the assets of wife fm  a radio station located in the cincinnati metropolitan area for approximately million in cash 
subject to the necessary regulatory approvals  we expect to complete this acquisition during the second half of  and we will consolidate it with our existing cincinnati operations 
in september  we announced an agreement to purchase the assets of whhl fm formerly wrda fm  a radio station located in the st 
louis metropolitan area for approximately million in cash 
we consolidated the station with our existing st 
louis operations  reformatted the station  and began operating the station under a local marketing agreement in october we expect to complete this acquisition during the second quarter of other than our agreements to purchase the assets of wife fm and whhl fm  and an agreement with an affiliate of comcast corporation  directv and other investors to fund tv one the balance of our commitment is million as of december   we have no definitive agreements to make acquisitions of additional radio stations or to make strategic investments 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions or strategic investments will be financed through funds generated from operations  cash on hand  equity financings  permitted debt financings  debt financings through unrestricted subsidiaries or a combination of these sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if available  will be available on favorable terms 
as of december   we had two standby letters of credit in the amount of  in connection with our annual insurance policy renewals 
to date  there has been no activity on the standby letters of credit 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt  our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in  and our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
in the next twelve months  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital  continued business development  strategic investment opportunities and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  for the foreseeable future  cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to make required payments of interest on our indebtedness  to fulfill our commitment to fund tv one  to fund potential acquisitions  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to enable us to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
however  in order to finance future acquisitions or investments  if any  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt 
as a result of their reviews  our credit rating could change 
we believe that any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may limit or eliminate our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future credit facilities  notes or other types of debt 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force issued topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill 
topic d prohibits the use of the residual method for all assets acquired in a business combination completed after september  further  companies that have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing should perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  we adopted topic d in and have obtained independent appraisals of all intangible assets acquired in order to perform our annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r sets forth accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of equity compensation is currently required under existing literature 
the statement also requires the tax benefit associated with these share based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation  for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are using the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and expect to use the modified prospective method in adopting the fair value method of measuring compensation cost relating to stock based employee compensation 
upon adoption  unrecognized non cash stock compensation expense related to unvested options outstanding as of december  was approximately million and will be recorded over the remaining vesting period of four years 
we anticipate that our adoption of sfas no

this statement is effective january   and had no impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plan as permitted by sfas no 
 which allows us to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and recognize no compensation cost for options granted to employees at fair market value 
we have computed  for pro forma disclosure purposes  the value of all compensatory options granted during  and  using the black scholes option pricing model 
options were assumed to be exercised upon vesting for the purpose of this valuation 
goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
radio broadcasting licenses acquired in business combinations are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis 
commencing january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount determined by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the recorded value of goodwill exceeds its implied value  an impairment charge for goodwill is recorded for the excess 
impairment of radio broadcasting licenses is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of the radio broadcasting license exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of a radio broadcasting license is the discounted cash flow value of its projected income stream 
if the recorded value of the radio broadcasting license exceeds its implied value  an impairment charge for the radio broadcasting license is recorded for the excess 
the company conducts its annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of every year 
the company determined that its long lived assets were not impaired during and  accordingly  no impairment charge was recognized 
see also notes and goodwill  radio broadcasting licenses and other intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses long lived assets  excluding goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we will evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in an agency s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue for broadcast advertising when the commercial is broadcast and is reported net of agency and outside sales representative commissions in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 topic  revenue recognition  revised and updated 
when applicable  agency and outside sales representative commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
generally  clients remit the gross billing amount to the agency or outside sales representative  and the agency or outside sales representative remits the gross billing  less their commission  to us 
equity accounting we account for our investment in tv one under the equity method of accounting in accordance with apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and other related interpretations 
we have recorded our investment at cost and have adjusted the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the change in radio one s claim on the net assets of tv one resulting from losses of tv one as well as other capital transactions of tv one using a hypothetical liquidation at book value approach 
we will review the realizability of the investment if conditions are present or events occur to suggest that an impairment of the investment may exist 
we have determined that although tv one is a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  the company is not the primary beneficiary of tv one 
see note investment in affiliated company for further discussion 
contingencies and litigation we regularly evaluate our exposure relating to any contingencies or litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss  or are probable but for which an estimate of the liability is not currently available 
estimate of effective tax rates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
in addition  we consider the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining if a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
our estimate of our effective tax rates has ranged from to throughout this includes the current year favorable impact for the ohio tax law change 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rates as of december  would result in an increase in income tax expense of  to approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense would result in a decrease in net income of  to approximately million from approximately million reducing net income per share basic and diluted by to for the year ended december  impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
seasonality several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
capital and commercial commitments long term debt in june  we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the term of the credit agreement is seven years and the total amount available under the credit agreement is million  consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility 
borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with provisions of the credit agreement  including but not limited to  financial covenants 
we may use proceeds from the credit facilities for working capital  capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of business  our common stock repurchase program  direct and indirect investments permitted under the credit agreement  and other lawful corporate purposes 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that we must comply with  including a maintaining a ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense of no less than to  b maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt for borrowed money to consolidated adjusted ebitda of no greater than to from june  to september   and no greater than to beginning october  and thereafter  c limitations on liens  d limitations on the sale of assets  e limitations on the payment of dividends  and f limitations on mergers  as well as other customary covenants 
simultaneous with entering into the credit agreement  we borrowed million under the credit agreement to retire all outstanding obligations under our previous credit agreement  dated as of july  the previous credit agreement provided for borrowings up to million  and consisted of a million term facility and a million revolving facility 
in february  we completed the private placement of million senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering  in addition to borrowings of million under our previous revolving credit facility  and available cash  were primarily used to redeem our outstanding high tides in an amount of million 
in october  the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for an equal amount of notes registered under the securities act 
in may  we completed the private placement of million senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our credit facilities and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in november  the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for an equal amount of notes registered under the securities act 
lease obligations we have non cancelable operating leases for office space  studio space  broadcast towers and transmitter facilities and non cancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next years 
operating contracts and agreements we have other operating contracts and agreements including employment contracts  on air talent contracts  severance obligations  retention bonuses  consulting agreements  equipment rental agreements  programming related agreements  and other general operating agreements that expire over the next years 
contractual obligations schedule the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations and beyond total in thousands senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes credit facilities capital lease obligations other operating contracts agreements operating lease obligations total the above amounts do not include interest  which in some cases is variable in amount 
includes employment contracts  severance obligations  on air talent contracts  consulting agreements  equipment rental agreements  programming related agreements  and other general operating agreements 
includes a retention bonus of approximately million pursuant to an employment agreement with the chief administrative officer cao for remaining employed with the company through and including october  if the cao s employment ends before october   the amount paid will be a pro rata portion of the retention bonus based on the number of days of employment between october  and october  includes a retention bonus of approximately million pursuant to an employment agreement with the chief financial officer cfo for remaining employed with the company through and including october  if the cfo s employment ends before october   the amount paid will be a pro rata portion of the retention bonus based on the number of days of employment between october  and october  reflected in the obligations above  as of december   we had four swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
if we terminate our interest swap agreements before they expire  we will be required to pay early termination fees 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  other than as follows we utilize letters of credit in connection with our annual insurance policy renewals 
during the year ended december   we obtained two standby letters of credit in the amounts of  and  in connection with our annual insurance policy renewals 
in december  we obtained a new standby letter of credit in the amount of  to replace the letter of credit of  accordingly  as of december   we had two standby letters of credit in the amount of  to date  there has been no further activity on the standby letters of credit 
as of december   we had four interest rate swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million to hedge our variable rate debt 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
if we terminate our interest swap agreements before they expire  we will be required to pay early termination fees 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
see note derivative instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk both the term loan facility and the revolving facility under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from to  or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
we also pay a commitment fee that varies depending on certain financial covenants and the amount of unused commitment  up to a maximum of per annum on the average balance of the revolving facility 
we believe that we are in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
under our credit agreement  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
as a result  we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that the bank pays to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of march   we have four swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million  and the periods remaining on these swap agreements range in duration from to months 
our credit exposure under these swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation 
we estimated the net fair value of these instruments as of december  to be a receivable of approximately million 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is estimated by obtaining quotations from the financial institutions  which are parties to our swap agreement contracts 
the fair value is an estimate of the net amount that we would have received on december  if the agreements were transferred to other parties or cancelled by us 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to variable rate debt instruments 
if the borrowing rates under libor were to increase above the current rates at december   our interest expense on the revolving credit facility would increase approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of derivative rate hedging instruments as described above 
the determination of the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to the effects of interest rate risk 
the estimated fair value of our senior subordinated notes due and senior subordinated notes due at december  were and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts were million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair value of our senior subordinated notes due at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in expected current interest rate yield would be to increase the estimated fair value of our senior subordinated notes due from million to million at december  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in expected current interest rate yield would be to increase the estimated fair value of our senior subordinated notes due from million to million at december
