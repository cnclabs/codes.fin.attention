item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of hydril s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with hydril s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged worldwide in engineering  manufacturing and marketing premium connection and pressure control products used for oil and gas drilling and production 
our premium connection products are marketed primarily to exploration and production company operators  who are the end users 
we sell our pressure control products primarily to drilling contractors for use in oil and gas drilling and to a lesser extent to exploration and production companies for oil and gas production 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent on the activity levels in the oil and gas industry and our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the level of these capital expenditures is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
generally  increasing commodity prices result in increased oil and gas exploration and production  which translates into greater demand for oilfield products and services 
conversely  falling commodity prices generally result in reduced demand for oilfield products and services 
historically  changes in budgets and activity levels by oil and gas exploration and production companies have lagged significant movements in commodity prices 
the level of worldwide drilling activity  in particular  the number of rigs drilling at target depths greater than  feet and the number of rigs drilling offshore generally drive the level of demand for our premium connection products  although the rate of consumption varies widely among markets based on specific geological formations  customer history and preference  and available alternatives 
the main factors that affect sales of pressure control capital equipment products are the level of construction of new drilling rigs and the rate at which existing rigs are refurbished 
demand for new rig construction and the refurbishment of existing rigs is highly cyclical and typically does not increase until utilization of the drilling fleet assets of major drilling contractors reaches a high level for a sustained period of time 
demand for our pressure control aftermarket replacement parts  repair and field services primarily depends upon the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity  as well as the total us rig count 
over the past three years  oil and natural gas prices  usually referred to as commodity prices have steadily increased 
average us crude oil prices for increased from the average  average prices increased and average prices increased 
average natural gas prices increased in from the average  average prices increased and average prices increased 
as a result of these higher commodity prices  drilling activity in the united states rose throughout this three year period 
the us rig count ended at  which was above the year ended the u 
s rig count ended up from the prior year and ended up 
the us deep formation rig count rigs drilling to a target depth greater than  feet ended at  an increase of over the year ended  and averaged in and in internationally  drilling activity overall also increased  although not to the same extent as domestic levels 
the international rig count rigs drilling outside of the united states and canada ended at  up from the year ended  ended up and ended up 
the worldwide offshore rig count for averaged and was down compared to the average and the average was up from the previous year 
the worldwide offshore rig count ended the year of at  down from at the end of this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of rigs drilling in the gulf of mexico due to damage sustained in hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter 
despite this decline  the average worldwide offshore rig count in increased compared to 
table of contents despite higher commodity prices and rising rig counts in the united states during  there was lower demand for premium connections in the united states market as a result of distributors reducing inventory stocking levels and placing only limited replenishment orders 
in addition deep formation and deep water drilling activity did not recover proportionately to the overall rig count increase 
many of the rigs returning to work in the united states and canada during were for shallow wells that do not require premium connection products 
while the international rig count increased overall in  certain of our key markets such as nigeria and venezuela had lower rig counts which diminished our revenue opportunities 
political and civil uncertainties in these markets dampened the level of spending by oil and gas companies operating there 
the level of pressure control capital equipment orders received during remained weak 
while commodity prices and rig counts increased during the year  these increases had not been sustained over a long enough period of time to cause demand for new rig construction and refurbishment of existing rigs to rise 
as a result  our pressure control capital equipment revenue decreased in and was down from however  due to the rising rig counts and the increased utilization of existing rigs our spare parts and repair services increased during as compared to during  rising rig counts in the united states  and in particular the increase in the deep formation rig count  resulted in higher demand for our premium connections in the us in addition to the improvement in demand due to increased drilling activity  during the year customers generally stopped drawing down inventories of our products  which resulted in an additional incremental increase in customer orders and revenues 
for  demand in certain of our key international markets was considerably better than indicated by the slight increase in the overall international rig count 
in particular  demand in latin america was much stronger than the previous year 
announced plans to increase oil and gas drilling in venezuela and mexico helped to increase demand for our products in those countries 
during  the pressure control capital equipment market continued to be weak 
as was the case in  the improvements in market conditions for major drilling contractors were not yet sufficient to support the construction of new rigs and rig refurbishments 
as a result  capital equipment revenue decreased during and was down compared to in contrast  the gradual increase in the total us rig count and the worldwide offshore rig count caused an increase in our pressure control aftermarket business of in as compared to with commodity prices and rig counts increasing for the third straight year during  worldwide demand for our premium connection products and aftermarket spare parts and services continued its strong upward trend 
in addition to the improvement in demand due to increased drilling activity  in customers generally increased their levels of premium connection inventories which resulted in an additional incremental increase in customer orders and revenues 
this is compared to when customers maintained inventory levels and when customers decreased their inventories 
also  demand in in most of our key international markets was considerably better than indicated by the small increase in the overall international rig count 
during the capital equipment market improved significantly as major drilling contractors issued a significant number of purchase orders for the construction of new drilling rigs and the refurbishment of existing rigs 
the major factors that led to this improvement were the return to higher sustained level of profitability and cash flow for the major drilling contractors 
during the year both land and offshore rig counts continued to rise which led drilling contractors to begin to anticipate potential rig shortages for future periods 
this resulted in day rates  the daily rates that drilling contractors charge for their drilling services  to increase significantly 
as a result  our backlog of capital equipment orders ended at million versus million at the end of the delivery of orders in the backlog at december  extends to mid year this increased activity caused our capital equipment revenue to increase in as compared to 
table of contents higher average worldwide offshore and us rig counts  caused our revenue for pressure control aftermarket spare parts and repairs services to increase compared to revenue with the exception of revenue from pressure control long term projects  we record revenue for all products and services at the time such products are delivered or services are provided 
in  of our revenue was recorded on this basis 
for our pressure control long term projects which are generally contracts from six to eighteen months in duration and an estimated contract price in excess of million  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to estimated final cost 
we use this method because we consider expended contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
if a long term contract was anticipated to have an estimated loss  such loss would be recognized in the period in which the loss becomes apparent 
see critical accounting estimates for more information regarding estimates and assumptions relating to revenue recognition 
gross profit our gross profit is the difference between our revenue and our cost of sales 
cost of sales for our products include purchased raw materials and components  manufacturing labor  plant overhead expenses  and building and equipment depreciation 
some of the costs are fixed cost and cause our margins to suffer when demand is low and manufacturing capacity is underutilized 
also included in cost of sales are the costs of product warranty  product liability insurance and inventory valuation adjustments  including last in  first out inventory valuation adjustments and adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we do not take title to the tubulars we thread for the united states and canadian market  and therefore  own no inventories of tubulars for sales in these countries 
however  we purchase tubulars for fulfilling a portion of our existing orders outside of the united states and canada 
the revenue from the sale of those tubulars is generally less than of our total revenue 
for our pressure control products  we have inventory for existing orders in process as well as a replacement parts inventory both internationally and domestically 
a majority of our inventory is for our pressure control segment 
selling  general and administration expenses our selling  general and administration expenses include engineering expenses that relate to research  product design  development and maintenance  as well as sales and marketing expenses  which consist mostly of personnel and related expenses  and commissions paid to third party agents selling our products 
also included are general and administration expenses that relate to accounting  treasury  information technology  human resources  legal expenses and corporate overhead 
operating income loss our operating income loss is gross profit less selling  general and administration expenses 
operating income loss is comprised of the operating income of each of our premium connection and pressure control segments and the portion of selling  general and administration expenses  referred to as corporate administration  which is not allocated to either segment 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue increased  to million 
the increase in our premium connection revenue was primarily the result of higher demand for our products worldwide  including pipe purchased by us for threading and resale in certain international markets 
in north america  which was responsible for about half of the increase  higher levels of deep formation drilling activity drove higher production volumes and higher pricing throughout the year 
during the third quarter  three hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
table of contents temporarily shut down our gulf coast plants which resulted in slightly lower revenue from premium connections in the third and fourth quarters 
pressure control revenue increased to million 
pressure control capital equipment revenue increased driven by higher levels of new and refurbished rig construction in the industry which increased demand for the type of equipment we manufacture 
aftermarket pressure control revenue increased primarily due to higher worldwide offshore and us total rig counts  resulting in increases in the consumption of spare parts in the drilling process 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for from million in gross profit for our premium connection segment increased due primarily to higher demand for our products worldwide which led to higher plant utilization  lower manufacturing costs per unit and higher pricing levels in the us and select international markets 
gross profit for our pressure control segment increased from the prior year due primarily to increased demand for higher margin aftermarket products  increased production volume for our pressure control capital equipment and lower excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements due to an improving business environment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily the result of higher agent commissions associated with higher international sales  increases in sales and marketing expenses  amortization of deferred compensation related to awards of restricted stock units and higher legal and engineering expenses 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment increased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense there was no interest expense in or as there were no borrowings or outstanding debt 
other income and expense other income for was million compared to other expense of million in the period included a million gain recorded from the sale of real estate not used in operations 
also included was expense of million for an increase in environmental reserves on non operational real estate assets and million of expense to maintain non operational real estate assets 
other expense in of million was primarily to maintain non operational real estate assets 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for the year ended included a million us income tax benefit extraterritorial income exclusion  related to export shipments and a million research and experimentation us tax credit 
the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction recorded in is for years and the research and experimentation credit recorded in covers qualified spending for the two year period from to prior to  the company was an alternative minimum tax payer and accordingly could not benefit from the research and experimentation tax credit 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue increased to million and pressure control revenue decreased to million 
the increase in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of higher demand in certain markets  primarily latin america  which included some restocking orders for venezuela 
in addition  increases in north america were due to higher sustained levels of deep formation drilling activity  operator mix within that sector and the cessation in general of distributor s drawing down their inventory  which had negatively impacted order levels in the decrease in pressure control revenue was attributable to a decrease in revenue from capital equipment due to lower revenue from long term projects consistent with the low level of new rig construction and refurbishment in the industry 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in pressure control aftermarket revenue  primarily repair and service activity  which resulted from increasing rig counts and drilling activity worldwide 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for from million in gross profit in our premium connection segment increased due primarily to higher demand in both our international and domestic markets and price increases in selected international markets 
this higher demand led to higher plant utilization  and accordingly lower  manufacturing costs per unit 
pressure control gross profit increased from the prior year period due to increased revenue from higher margin aftermarket products and was partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue which resulted in lower plant utilization and higher manufacturing costs per unit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily the result of employee incentive plan accruals related to the improved financial performance  higher expenses related to the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act requirements  and higher agent commissions due to increased international sales 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment increased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense there was no interest expense in compared to million in during the second quarter of  our remaining debt of million was repaid 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for the year ended included a million us income tax benefit extraterritorial income exclusion  related to export shipments and a million research and experimentation us tax credit  while the prior year included a research and experimentation us tax credit of million 
the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction recorded in is for years and the research and experimentation credit recorded in covers qualified spending for the two year period from to  while the credit recorded in covers qualified spending for the ten year period from through prior to  the company was an 
table of contents alternative minimum tax payer and accordingly could not benefit from the research and experimentation tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  fund new product development and provide additional working capital 
our primary source of funds is cash flow from operations 
in addition  we had available cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at december  at december   we had no outstanding indebtedness and million in outstanding letters of credit which are comprised primarily of performance bonds related to customer orders in our backlog 
we believe that cash from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements  including working capital needs  contractual obligations and planned capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
in the longer term  if we were to need additional cash  we anticipate that we could enter into credit facilities and also raise additional funds through issuing debt or equity securities 
in march  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock over the next twelve months 
the company intends to repurchase its shares  beginning in the second quarter of  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on  among other things  its ongoing capital requirements  expected cash flows  regulatory restraints and general market conditions 
future repurchases are expected to be funded with cash flows from operations 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for cash provided by operating activities in was primarily from earnings and contractual cash payments received on long term capital equipment projects  which was partially offset by higher working capital requirements which included increases in inventories of approximately million to support higher product demand in both of our segments 
cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of earnings and contractual cash payments received on long term capital equipment projects  which was partially offset by slightly higher working capital requirements 
cash provided by operations in was primarily due to earnings and contractual cash payments received from customers on long term capital equipment projects  which was partially offset by a million contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million in the investment of cash in includes net investments in marketable securities of million  capital spending of million  the purchase of a pressure control product line for million  proceeds from the sale of real estate not used in operations of million and million for investments in business development including the purchase of a product line for our premium connections segment 
the investment of cash in was primarily for net investments in marketable securities of million and capital spending of million 
the investment of cash in of million was primarily for capital spending of million and net investments in marketable securities of million 
for more information on capital expenditures for the three years ended december  see capital expenditures below 
financing activities during  we received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million compared to million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
during  we repaid million of senior notes at maturity and as a result have no outstanding indebtedness 

table of contents credit facilities during the first six months of we had two unsecured revolving lines of credit for working capital requirements that provided up to million in total committed revolving credit borrowings 
on june  these revolving lines of credit expired in accordance with their stated maturities 
the company s banking institutions currently issue letters of credit on the company s behalf based on its credit worthiness 
at december   there was approximately million outstanding in letters of credit  which included million of performance bonds related to customer orders in our backlog 
in addition  the company has agreed to guarantee half of the total outstanding borrowings of our premium connection indian joint venture  an unconsolidated entity of which we own  up to a maximum of approximately million by issuing irrevocable standby letters of credit 
as of december   the total amount of borrowings of the joint venture was approximately million  of which million was subject to the company s guarantee 
the company does not expect this guarantee to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
contractual cash obligations the following paragraph summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in millions operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total represents obligations for minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases 
the company s lease commitments are primarily for operating facilities  vehicles and equipment 
represents obligations under outstanding purchase orders and other commitments and estimated future cash payments pursuant to contractual obligations related to investments in joint ventures 
represents estimated future cash payments for post retirement health and life benefits  pension plan benefits and deferred compensation 
other indebtedness in june  the company issued million of senior notes due june  during the third quarter of  the company prepaid million of the aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes plus a make whole premium of million relating to this prepayment 
the make whole premium was included as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company repaid the remaining million at maturity on june  capital expenditures capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment  million for our pressure control segment and million for general corporate purposes 
the majority of the expenditures were to support plant and equipment machine tool upgrades  to increase capacity in our premium connection segment and to purchase land and buildings for a new pressure control plant in mexico 
capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment and million for our pressure control segment  in both cases primarily to support plant equipment replacements and upgrades  and million for general corporate purposes 

table of contents capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment and million for our pressure control segment  in both cases primarily to support plant and equipment for our manufacturing operations  and million for general corporate purposes 
if current industry conditions continue  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million  which includes a level of spending of approximately to million necessary to maintain our existing operations 
the remaining expenditures are anticipated to be used to continue to gradually increase our premium connection manufacturing capacity  acquire equipment for our new pressure control plant under construction in mexico  fund business investments in emerging international markets and for additional manufacturing capacity at our houston pressure control plant 
dividends we have not paid any dividends on our common stock or our class b common stock since prior to our initial public offering in october we have no plans to declare or pay any dividends in the immediate future 
any declaration of a dividend would be dependent upon hydril s results of operations  financial condition  cash position and requirements  investment and acquisition opportunities  future prospects  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
backlog pressure control capital equipment backlog which includes orders for capital equipment and long term projects  at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in our backlog reflects million of new long term capital equipment project orders received in this increase is the attributable to a significant rise in new rig construction and refurbishment worldwide 
we recognize the revenue and gross profit from pressure control long term projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
as revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  the order value in backlog is reduced 
we expect to recognize revenue from orders in our backlog at december  over the next three years 
it is possible for orders to be cancelled  however  in the event of cancellations all costs incurred would be billable to the customer 
our backlog of premium connection and pressure control aftermarket parts and service is not a meaningful measure of business prospects due to the quick turnover of such orders and the majority of such orders are cancelable at will by the purchaser without penalty
