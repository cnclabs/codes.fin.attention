part i item business general option care is a leading provider of home infusion pharmacy services and specialty pharmacy services to patients with acute or chronic conditions that can be treated at home  at one of our local ambulatory infusion centers or in a physician s office 
we provide these services to patients on behalf of managed care organizations  government healthcare programs and biopharmaceutical manufacturers through two company owned  high volume distribution facilities  company owned and managed locations and franchised locations throughout the united states 
our services include the distribution and administration of infused and injectible medications  patient care coordination  clinical and compliance management and reimbursement support 
for the years ended december  and  we generated net revenue of million and million  respectively  and net income of million and million  respectively 
we are a leading provider to managed care organizations and other third party payors  patients  physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers with a cost effective solution for both home infusion pharmacy services and specialty pharmacy services nationwide 
our combination of national and local distribution capabilities  our sales and marketing resources  and our clinical staff and information systems support our customers as follows payors we provide payors with a comprehensive approach to meeting their pharmacy services needs 
our provision of infusion pharmacy services in the patient s home or at one of our local ambulatory infusion centers offers a lower cost alternative to providing these therapies in a hospital setting 
our specialty pharmacy services offer payors a cost effective solution for the distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals directly to patients for self administration 
we also provide the direct distribution of biotech pharmaceuticals to physicians offices for in office administration 
this provides payors with a cost effective alternative to direct billing of biotech pharmaceuticals by physicians 
we also provide payors with utilization and outcomes data to evaluate therapy effectiveness 
patients we improve patients quality of life by allowing them to remain at home while receiving necessary medications  supplies and services or visit one of our ambulatory infusion centers to receive care 
in addition  we help manage patients conditions through counseling and education regarding their treatment and by providing ongoing monitoring to encourage patient compliance with the prescribed therapy 
we also provide services to help patients receive reimbursement benefits 
physicians we assist physicians with time intensive patient support by providing care management related to their patients pharmacy needs and improving compliance with therapy protocols 
we eliminate the need for physicians to carry inventories of high cost prescriptions by distributing the medications directly to patients homes or  if required  to the physicians offices 
we either bill the payor directly or assist the patient in the submission of claims to the payor 
pharmaceutical manufacturers we provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with a broad distribution channel for their existing pharmaceuticals and their new product launches 
we implement patient monitoring programs that encourage compliance with the prescribed therapy 
we also provide valuable clinical information in the form of outcomes and compliance data to manufacturers to aid in their evaluation of the efficacy of their products 
our company was founded in and was a pioneer in the delivery of home infusion services 
the industry was formed when the technology emerged allowing for the safe and cost effective administration of infused medications in a home environment 
in addition  medicare reimbursement changes in encouraged hospitals to reduce length of stays creating increased discharges to alternate site settings 
during the s  we expanded our services nationally with a franchise model targeting markets with populations of fewer than  we completed our initial public offering on april  and embarked on transitioning the company from a franchise organization to a healthcare services provider through an acquisition program targeting franchised and non affiliated operations 
since the mid s  we have focused on building a leadership position in the home infusion industry in markets of all sizes and have been able to leverage our local pharmacy capabilities to distribute niche  high cost therapies targeting chronic conditions 
due to the robust biotech pharmaceutical product pipeline  we have seen a significant increase in the distribution of these high cost specialty medications 
as a result  we have created a specialized service offering that meets the needs of patients  product manufacturers and managed care organizations 
we are engaged in one reportable industry segment containing three service lines specialty pharmacy  infusion and related healthcare services  and other 
the following table presents summarized information about our revenue by service line for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands years ended december  amounts of total amounts of total amounts of total revenue specialty pharmacy infusion and related healthcare services other total revenue available information we maintain our internet website at http www

information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol optn 
we were incorporated in delaware in july our principal executive offices are located at half day road  suite  buffalo grove  illinois  and our telephone number is industry healthcare related expenditures constitute a large and growing segment of the us economy 
according to estimates by the centers for medicare medicaid services  national health expenditures reached an estimated trillion in  are expected to reach trillion in and are projected to increase to trillion by in  prescription drug expenditures were billion  representing of national healthcare expenditures for that year 
prescription drugs remain among the fastest growing categories of healthcare expenditure  having grown at double digit rates each year from to two important trends that impact our business have emerged in relation to healthcare spending 
these trends are positively impacting the growth of the many services we provide government programs  private insurance companies  managed care organizations and self insured employers have implemented various cost containment measures to limit the growth of healthcare expenditures 
these cost containment measures  together with technological advances  have resulted in a shift in the delivery of many healthcare services away from traditional hospital settings to more cost effective settings  including patients homes 
as a result of the proliferation of biotech research and development  biotech companies and pharmaceuticals manufacturers have developed a variety of high cost biotech pharmaceuticals 
these biotech pharmaceuticals are most often used in the treatment of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia  cancer and immune deficiency disorders 
these biotech pharmaceuticals  which in many cases cost over  per patient per year  are typically used on a recurring basis for extended periods of time and require special inventory handling  administration and patient compliance monitoring 
historically  traditional pharmacy distribution channels have not been designed to handle the additional services required by many of these medications 
pharmacy services pharmacy services include the treatment of a wide range of chronic and acute health conditions with a range of injectible and infusible specialty pharmaceuticals 
less acute  chronic conditions are generally treated with self administered  injectible pharmaceuticals but may also be administered by a physician or nurse 
these pharmaceuticals can be directly distributed to the patient or the patient s physician for in office administration and in many cases cost over  per patient per year 
these pharmaceuticals may require refrigeration during shipping as well as special handling to prevent potency degradation 
patients receiving treatment usually require special counseling and education regarding their condition and treatment programs 
this segment of the pharmacy services industry primarily treats conditions such as multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia  cancer  immune deficiency disorders  asthma and other chronic conditions 
retail pharmacies and other traditional distributors generally are designed to carry inventories of low cost  high volume products and therefore are not equipped to handle the high cost  low volume specialty pharmaceuticals that have specialized handling and administration requirements 
as a result  these specialty pharmaceuticals are generally provided by pharmacies that focus primarily on filling  labeling and delivering injectible pharmaceuticals and related support services 
ims health has estimated the us market for specialty pharmaceuticals at nearly billion and the market is growing rapidly 
we expect several factors to contribute to the continuing growth of the specialty pharmacy services industry  including the following healthcare cost containment pressures  development of new pharmaceuticals  direct to consumer advertising  increased acceptance of mail order distribution  and growing emphasis on care management and compliance monitoring to improve outcomes for these high cost  chronic diseases 
more acute  chronic conditions are generally treated with infusible pharmaceuticals that require administration of a more complex nature 
these pharmaceuticals are primarily administered to treat infections  dehydration  cancer  pain and nutritional deficiencies 
patients are generally referred to infusion pharmacy services providers by physicians  hospital discharge planners and case managers 
the medications are mixed and dispensed under the supervision of a registered pharmacist and the therapy is typically delivered in the home of the patient by a registered nurse or trained caregiver 
depending on the preferences of the patient and or the payor  these services may also be provided at an ambulatory infusion center 
according to the national home infusion association  the size of the home infusion pharmacy services industry is currently between and billion 
we believe that several factors will contribute to the continuing growth in non hospital based infusion therapy services  including the following healthcare cost containment pressures  increased number of therapies that can be safely administered in patients homes  patient preference for at home treatment  increased acceptance of home infusion by the medical community and by managed care organizations and other payors  technological innovations such as implantable injection ports  vascular access devices and portable infusion control devices  and increased utilization of home infusion therapies due to demographic trends  in particular increasing life expectancies 
growth strategy we intend to leverage our years of clinical experience managing a wide range of pharmaceutical therapies with the national coverage of our high volume distribution facilities and local pharmacy locations to deliver a single source solution for infused and injected pharmaceuticals and services to our customers 
our ability to provide a flexible distribution model which includes the delivery of our cost effective services to patients homes  physicians offices or our local ambulatory infusion centers  makes us an attractive provider to government health plans  managed care organizations  insurance companies and other third party payors and referral sources 
we intend to increase our revenue and profitability through organic growth as well as selective acquisitions  start ups and joint ventures that expand our geographic coverage into new markets and consolidate providers in existing markets that we serve 
organic growth we intend to expand our infusion and specialty services through sales and marketing activities targeting managed care organizations  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and local referral sources 
we currently have contracts with most major managed care organizations  which cover approximately million lives  and are actively expanding the range of infusion and specialty services under these relationships 
in addition  we are actively targeting new managed care relationships to contract for a wide variety of our services 
our pharmaceutical manufacturer strategy includes expanding our relationships with biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in order to acquire distribution rights to existing and new products targeting chronic diseases or conditions 
our local sales force continuously markets to a wide variety of referral sources stressing our clinical capabilities to meet the needs of patients with a wide range of acute and chronic conditions 
acquisitions the home infusion industry is highly fragmented with the majority of service providers operating primarily in local or regional markets 
currently  there are approximately  home infusion providers operating in the united states are small  individually owned or closely held operations while the remaining include a variety of local and national providers that are either hospital affiliated or independent 
we believe that few competitors possess the scale and resources to consolidate the industry and that our financial resources and operating strength affords us an advantage in this area 
additionally  our franchise network provides us with an established pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities 
our typical franchise agreement provides us with a right of first refusal for the potential acquisition of an existing franchise 
start ups we intend to open new pharmacies in the following types of markets new markets with large and growing populations  markets where our existing franchisees do not renew their franchise agreements with us  and markets adjacent to areas we currently serve and which will allow us to leverage existing infrastructure and managed care relationships 
joint ventures we intend to enter into joint ventures in select markets with established hospitals by merging with or partially acquiring a hospital system s home care business  or by contracting with a hospital system to jointly develop start up operations 
hospital partners may include centers of academic excellence  regional hospitals and community hospitals 
our services home infusion pharmacy and related healthcare services we provide home infusion pharmacy services through our local pharmacy network of company owned and managed pharmacies throughout the united states 
our services are most typically provided in the patient s home  but may also be provided at clinics  the physician s office or at one of our ambulatory infusion centers 
we offer patients and physicians the following products and services medication and supplies for administration and use at home or within one of our ambulatory infusion centers  consultation and education regarding the patient s condition and the prescribed medication  clinical monitoring and assistance in monitoring potential side effects  and assistance in obtaining reimbursement 
we provide the following home infusion therapies total parenteral nutrition intravenous therapy providing required nutrients to patients with digestive or gastro intestinal problems  most of whom have chronic conditions requiring treatment for life  anti infective therapy intravenous therapy providing medication for infections related to diseases such as osteomyelitis and urinary tract infections  pain management intravenous or continuous injection therapy  delivered by a pump  providing analgesic pharmaceuticals to reduce pain  enteral nutrition providing nutritional formula by tube directly into the stomach or colon  chemotherapy intravenous therapy providing prescription medications to treat cancer  and other therapies treating a wide range of medical conditions 
several of our company owned pharmacies also provide home health nursing services  respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment sales and rentals 
we also have one location that provides home hospice services 
specialty pharmacy services we provide specialty pharmacy services through our two company owned  high volume distribution facilities and our company owned and managed local pharmacies 
we purchase specialty pharmaceuticals from manufacturers and wholesale distributors  fill prescriptions provided by physicians  and label  package and deliver the pharmaceuticals to patients homes or physicians offices  either ourselves or through contract couriers 
depending on therapy  we may also administer the specialty pharmaceuticals to the patient at one of our ambulatory infusion centers 
our approach to delivering specialty pharmacy services includes a manufacturer strategy and managed care strategy to meet the unique needs of each customer segment 
for selected drugs  we also supply clinical efficacy and outcomes data to the manufacturers 
we provide specialty pharmacy services to treat the following chronic diseases or conditions growth hormone deficiency a condition that prevents normal growth patterns in children  generally caused by disorders of the pituitary gland or kidneys 
therapy consists of daily injections of growth hormone and usually lasts seven to nine years 
respiratory synctial virus rsv prevention rsv is a major cause of respiratory disease in young children and infants 
treatment is directed toward high risk pediatric patients  typically from infant to age two 
the most common treatment consists of monthly injections of synagis  a specialty pharmaceutical we distribute  throughout the rsv season which lasts from approximately october through april 
the following table illustrates the seasonal impact of the sales of synagis on our quarterly revenues for and amounts in thousands q q q q q q q q synagis revenue percent of total revenue hepatitis c virus a viral infection which results in the inflammation of the liver 
left untreated  hepatitis c virus can cause serious liver damage 
treatment includes injections of interferon alfa with the concomitant oral administration of ribavirin products 
treatment can last up to months 
multiple sclerosis a chronic  incurable  progressive disease of the central nervous system 
the goal of treatment is to decrease the severity  intensity and duration of outbreaks and to slow the progression of the disease 
treatment regimens involve pharmaceutical injections  and products vary widely 
hemophilia an inherited bleeding disorder that is caused by a blood clotting deficiency that results in a longer bleeding time 
hemophilia is one of the most costly diseases to treat 
the treatment goal is to raise the level of the deficient clotting factor and maintain it in order to stop the bleeding 
treatments include infusion of the clotting factor products 
the length of treatment depends on the severity of the bleeding episode  and the need for treatment continues throughout the life of the patient 
immune deficiency immune deficiencies are disorders which reduce the patient s ability to identify and destroy substances which do not belong in the human body and are characterized by reduced levels of antibodies 
intravenous immune globulins  which are infused to treat the immune deficiencies  are concentrated antibodies that have been purified from large numbers of human blood donors 
cancer includes a wide spectrum of tumors  abnormal growths and cellular abnormalities 
treatment includes radiation  chemotherapy and or surgery 
as a result of these treatments  patients may require therapies that combat anemia and increase white blood cell counts 
our specialty pharmacy programs provide chemothorapy and related products to physicians offices for in office administration and to patients homes 
asthma an inflammatory condition of the bronchial airways  most commonly caused by allergies 
the inflammation leads to airway obstruction  chest tightness  coughing and wheezing 
treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and typically consists of inhaled corticosteroids 
our specialty pharmacy program provides patients with an injectible drug  xolair  designed for adults and adolescents with moderate to severe allergic asthma that is inadequately controlled by the use of inhaled corticosteroids 
our suppliers we obtain the pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and equipment that we provide to our patients through pharmaceutical manufacturers  distributors and group purchasing organizations 
most of the pharmaceuticals that we purchase are available from multiple sources and are available in sufficient quantities to meet our needs and the needs of our patients 
however  some biotech drugs are only available through the manufacturer and may be subject to limits on distribution 
in such cases  it is important for us to establish and maintain good working relations with the manufacturer in order to assure sufficient supply to meet our patients needs 
we utilize several national delivery companies as an important part of the local and national distribution of our products and services  particularly in the delivery of certain specialty pharmaceutical products 
additionally  certain drugs may become subject to general supply shortages  as was the case in with ivig immune globulin products 
such shortages can result in cost increases or hamper our ability to obtain sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our patients 
we work diligently to obtain commitments from our suppliers  whenever possible  to secure ample supply of drugs that are potentially subject to supply shortages 
through the coverage and clinical expertise of our two company owned  high volume distribution facilities  our company owned locations and our franchised locations  we provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with a broad distribution channel for their existing pharmaceutical products 
this strength also provides us the opportunity to become a selected partner in the launch of their new products 
when providing new products to patients  we implement a monitoring program to encourage compliance with the prescribed therapy and we provide valuable clinical information to the manufacturer in the form of outcomes and compliance data to aid in their evaluation of the efficacy of the product 
we may receive fees  which we record as other revenue  from certain biotech manufacturers for providing them with clinical outcomes data 
our continued growth will be dependent on maintaining our existing relationships with manufacturers and establishing new relationships with additional manufacturers as they launch new specialty products 
through the combined purchasing power of our company owned and franchised locations  we are able to sign pharmaceutical purchase contracts with these supplies that provide us and our franchisees with volume discount pricing and provide us the opportunity to earn volume purchase rebates and vendor administration fees 
such fees are recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold to the extent they are earned by purchases made by our company owned locations and as revenue to the extent that they are related to purchases made by our franchised locations  with the majority of these fees being derived from purchases made by our company owned locations 
billing significant payors we derive most of our revenue from contracts with third party payors  such as managed care organizations  insurance companies  self insured employers and medicare and medicaid programs 
where permissible  we bill patients for any amounts not reimbursed by third party payors 
for the most part  our infusion pharmacy revenue consists of reimbursement for both the cost of the pharmaceuticals sold and the cost of services provided 
pharmaceuticals are typically reimbursed on a percentage discount from the published average wholesale price awp of each drug 
nursing services are typically paid separately  on a per visit basis  while other patient support services and ancillary medical supplies are either reimbursed separately or on a per diem basis  where applicable 
specialty pharmaceuticals are typically pre packaged drugs that are self injected by the patient or a trained in home caregiver 
therefore  minimal service is provided and no per diem revenue is generated 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc bc bs of florida 
we provide infusion pharmacy and specialty pharmacy services to bc bs of florida members throughout the state of florida 
this contract renews each september for an additional one year term and may be terminated by either party upon days notice 
for  our contract with bc bs of florida produced million in revenue 
in  and  respectively  approximately  and of our total revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  approximately and of option care s accounts receivable were due from bc bs of florida 
no other single managed care payor represents more than of our revenue 
we also provide services that are reimbursable through government healthcare programs such as medicare and state medicaid programs 
for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  approximately  and of our revenue came from government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
the amounts due from these programs represented approximately and of our total accounts receivable  respectively  as of december  and we bill payors and track all of our accounts receivable through computerized billing systems 
these systems allow our billing staff the flexibility to review and edit claims in the system before they are submitted to payors 
claims are submitted to payors either electronically or through the mail 
we utilize electronic claim submission whenever possible to expedite claim review and payment  and to minimize errors and omissions 
the net revenue that we report is based on usual and customary billing rates for the products and services we provide  less applicable contractual adjustments 
in most cases  our computerized billing systems generate contractual adjustments based on the fee schedules of the underlying insurance contracts when the claims are billed 
if our computerized billing systems cannot automatically generate the contractual adjustment for a given claim  we calculate the contractual adjustment manually and key the adjustment into our billing system when the claim is billed 
for revenue that is not yet billed  we estimate the contractual adjustments using a claim by claim analysis of the unbilled charges  by applying historic contractual adjustment percentages  or a combination of the two methods 
we generate accounts receivable aging reports from our billing systems and utilize these reports to help us monitor the condition of our outstanding receivables and evaluate the performance of our billing and reimbursement staff 
we also utilize these aging reports  combined with historic write off statistics generated from our billing systems  to determine our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our financial performance is highly dependent upon effective billing and collection practices at each of our company owned pharmacies 
the process begins with an accurate and complete patient admission process  in which all critical information about the patient  the patient s insurance and their care needs is gathered 
a critical part of this process is verification of insurance coverage and authorization from insurance to provide the required care  which typically takes place before we initiate services 
an exception occurs when a patient referral is received outside of normal business hours  but we have an existing contractual relationship with the patient s insurance carrier 
in such cases  we provide the patient with sufficient drugs and services to last until the next business day  when the patient s insurance coverage can be verified 
franchise program our franchise program was developed to increase our geographical presence and to provide a national network of pharmacies to service the needs of our managed care customers without requiring extensive capital expenditures 
in marketing our franchise program  we target independent infusion pharmacies that would benefit from participating in our national and regional managed care and manufacturer contracts as well as in our marketing programs 
our franchised locations are sold a license to operate an option care branded pharmacy in a defined territory to provide infusion therapy and related products and services 
we receive a start up fee upon execution of the franchise agreement with subsequent royalties based on a percentage of gross receipts of the franchised location 
each franchisee is required to maintain a licensed pharmacy equipped to compound medications in a sterile environment as prescribed by physicians 
in the program that we are currently marketing  the franchisee must obtain specified liability insurance protecting the franchise owner and us against claims arising from the operation of the franchised business 
our franchisees may participate in our managed care and manufacturer contracts 
they may also purchase pharmaceuticals and supplies from a preferred list of vendors under contract with us 
this frequently allows us and the franchisee to obtain volume discount pricing 
for certain pharmaceuticals  the franchise may also purchase directly from us 
most of our franchise agreements also provide us with a right of first refusal for the potential acquisition of the franchise 
however  none of our current agreements grants us the option to purchase the franchise at our will 
as of december   we had franchised pharmacy locations operating under separate franchise agreements 
approximately of our franchise agreements come up for renewal in the four year period from through as a franchise agreement nears expiration  we expect to propose a new agreement or evaluate the franchise for possible acquisition 
if we cannot reach agreement with the franchisee and the franchise expires  the franchisee is required to cease using the option care service mark and will not be able to access our managed care agreements or purchasing contracts 
we would then be free to re franchise the territory or to service the territory with a company owned facility 
termination of a franchise agreement by the franchise prior to its scheduled expiration date may subject the franchisee to early termination fees 
accordingly  we may record revenue as a result of such early terminations 
in addition  upon our acquisition of an existing franchise prior to the scheduled expiration of its underlying franchise agreement  we may record a gain or loss on settlement equal to the excess or shortfall of the present value of the estimated future royalties receivable under the terminated franchise agreement versus our current royalty market rates 
the following table summarizes the termination dates of our franchise agreements  by year  and presents the amount and percentage of our royalty revenue attributable to franchises terminating in each year as well as to franchises that were acquired or terminated from the network during dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  number of franchise agreements expiring attributable royalty revenue percent of royalty revenue total continuing agreements terminated during acquired during total all agreements for comparative purposes  the royalty revenue attributable to franchise locations that were terminated and acquired during was  representing of total royalty revenue 
disposal of assets for the past decade  our subsidiary  management by information  inc mbi  has developed and licensed proprietary software systems designed to manage the intake  dispensing  clinical  billing and collection processes for home infusion pharmacies 
during the quarter ended december   we completed the sale of mbi and its existing software products  including iemphsys  to definitive homecare solutions  ltd  which specializes in infusion pharmacy management software 
we have retained the right to utilize and develop our customized version of the iemphsys product as well as mbi s older dos based product 
we have retained and redeployed certain of mbi s employees to help maintain our version of these products 
upon our sale of mbi  we wrote off that portion of the iemphsys development costs that related to the standard product that was sold to definitive homecare solutions  ltd  while we will continue to capitalize and amortize past and continuing costs related to development of our customized version 
we do not expect the sale of mbi to have a material affect on our future revenue or results of operations 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts focus on three primary objectives building new relationships and expanding existing contracts with managed care organizations  establishing  maintaining and strengthening relationships with local and regional patient referral sources  and maintaining existing and developing new relationships with biotech drug manufacturers to gain distribution access as they release new products 
our national and regional sales directors focus primarily on establishing and expanding our contracts with managed care organizations  while our local account managers focus on pull through from these contracts by developing and maintaining relationships with local and regional referral sources  such as physicians  hospital discharge planners and case managers 
in addition  we have a sales force focused on maintaining and expanding our relationships with biotech drug manufacturers to establish our position as a participating provider when they release new products 
most new patients are referred to us by physicians  medical groups  hospital discharge planners  case managers employed by health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos or other managed care organizations  insurance companies and home care agencies 
our sales force is responsible for establishing and maintaining these referral relationships 
our sales structure allows us to take advantage of our national managed care relationships to provide sales and contract pull through by our local field based sales personnel 
additionally  the existence of our contracts with national managed care organizations provides our local sales personnel with more flexibility and leverage for sales in local markets 
this cross utility enables us to market our services to numerous sources of patient referrals  including physicians  hospital discharge planners  hospital personnel  hmos  ppos or other managed care organizations  and insurance companies 
local marketing focuses on our infusion pharmacy business and our care management programs  with an emphasis on certain key therapies 
competition our pharmacies compete in the large and highly fragmented home infusion and specialty pharmacy markets 
we compete with others for contracts with managed care organizations and other third party payors and compete to receive referrals from physicians  case managers and hospital discharge planners 
competition in the home infusion market is based on quality of care  cost of service and reputation 
competition in the specialty pharmacy market is based on price  reliability of service  compliance programs and reputation 
some of our existing and potential competitors in the home infusion market include integrated home healthcare providers such as apria healthcare group inc and coram healthcare corporation  and local providers of alternate site healthcare services such as hospitals  local home health agencies and other local providers 
in the specialty pharmacy market  our existing and potential competitors include specialty pharmacy providers such as medco health solutions  caremark rx  express scripts  curative health services and others  specialized retail pharmacies such as pharmacare  a division of cvs corporation  pharmacy benefit management companies  wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
in each market  some of these current competitors have  and our potential future competitors may have  greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources than us 
however  we believe that our reputation for providing quality services  the strength of our growing national presence and our ability to effectively market our services at national  regional and local levels places us in a strong position against existing and potential competitors 
governmental regulation the healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal  state and local level 
the industry is also subject to frequent regulatory change 
laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation 
moreover  our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to our managed care and other clients 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations directly applicable to our business  we could suffer civil and or criminal penalties  and we could be excluded from participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which would have an adverse impact on our business 
if our franchisees fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to their businesses  they could suffer civil and or criminal penalties and or be excluded from participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
professional licensure 
nurses  pharmacists and certain other healthcare professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law 
we perform criminal and other background checks on employees and take steps to ensure that our employees possess all necessary licenses and certifications  and we believe that our employees comply in all material respects with applicable licensure laws 
each of our franchisees is responsible for ensuring the licensing or certification of its employees in accordance with applicable law  performing any criminal or other background checks required by state law  and ensuring that all employees perform only those tasks which fall within their authorized scope of practice 
while each franchisee is responsible for any failure or non compliance with respect to these licensure and scope of practice issues  any such failure or non compliance by a franchisee that impacts such franchisee s operations could have an adverse effect on our business 
pharmacy licensing and registration 
state laws require that each of our pharmacy locations be licensed as an in state pharmacy to dispense pharmaceuticals in that state 
certain states also require that our pharmacy locations be licensed as an out of state pharmacy if we deliver prescription pharmaceuticals into those states from locations outside of the state 
we believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business 
if we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non resident pharmacies  our ability to operate in some states would be limited  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
laws enforced by the drug enforcement administration  as well as some similar state agencies  require our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances  including prescription pharmaceuticals 
a separate registration is required at each principal place of business where we dispense controlled substances 
federal and state laws also require that we follow specific labeling  reporting and record keeping requirements for controlled substances 
we maintain federal and state controlled substance registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding controlled substances 
many states in which we operate also require home infusion companies to be licensed as home health agencies 
we believe we are in compliance with these laws  as applicable 
food  drug and cosmetic act 
certain provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act govern the handling and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
this law exempts many pharmaceuticals and medical devices from federal labeling and packaging requirements as long as they are not adulterated or misbranded and are dispensed in accordance with and pursuant to a valid prescription 
we believe that we comply with all applicable requirements 
fraud and abuse laws anti kickback statute 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying  offering  receiving  or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase  lease  order  arrange for  or recommend services or goods covered by medicare  medicaid  or other government healthcare programs 
the federal courts have held that an arrangement violates the anti kickback statute if any one purpose of the remuneration is to induce the referral of patients covered by the medicare or medicaid programs  even if another purpose of the payment is to compensate an individual for rendered services 
the anti kickback statute is broad and potentially covers many standard business arrangements 
violations can lead to significant penalties  including criminal fines of up to  per violation and or five years imprisonment  civil monetary penalties of up to  per violation plus treble damages  and or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid  and other federal government healthcare programs 
in an effort to clarify the conduct prohibited by the anti kickback statute  the office of the inspector general oig of the united states department of health and human services has published regulations that identify a limited number of safe harbors 
business arrangements that satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor are immune from criminal enforcement or civil administrative actions 
the anti kickback statute is an intent based statute and the failure of a business relationship to satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor does not in and of itself mean that the business relationship violates the anti kickback statute 
the oig  in its commentary to the safe harbor regulations  has recognized that many business arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor nonetheless operate without the type of abuses the anti kickback statute is designed to prevent 
we attempt to structure our business relationships to satisfy an applicable safe harbor 
however  in those situations where a business relationship does not fully satisfy the elements of a safe harbor  or where no safe harbor exists  we attempt to satisfy as many elements of an applicable safe harbor as possible 
the oig is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the anti kickback statute  including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions 
we have not  however  sought any opinions regarding our business relationships 
a number of states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the anti kickback statute described above 
some state anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by medicaid 
other state anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply to all healthcare goods and services  regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private 
where applicable  we attempt to structure our business relationships to comply with these statutes 
fraud and abuse laws false claims act 
we are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement 
these laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully presenting a claim or causing a claim to be presented for payment from a federal healthcare program that is false or fraudulent 
the standard for knowing and willful may include conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for the accuracy of information presented to payors 
penalties under these statutes include substantial civil and criminal fines  exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs and imprisonment 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal false claims act  which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private plaintiff by filing a qui tam lawsuit on the government s behalf 
under the false claims act  the government and private plaintiffs  if any  may recover monetary penalties in the amount of  to  per false claim  as well as an amount equal to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted their own false claims statutes as well as statutes that allow individuals to bring qui tam actions 
we believe that we have procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of our claims 
ethics in patient referrals law stark law 
the federal stark law generally prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services dhs  reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless an exception applies 
a financial relationship is generally defined as an ownership  investment or compensation relationship 
dhs include  but are not limited to  outpatient pharmaceuticals  parenteral and enteral nutrition products  home health services  durable medical equipment  physical and occupational therapy services  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
among other sanctions  a civil monetary penalty of up to  may be imposed for each bill or claim for a service a person knows or should know is for a service for which payment may not be made due to the stark law 
such persons or entities are also subject to exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
any person or entity participating in a circumvention scheme to avoid the referral prohibitions is liable for a civil monetary penalty of up to  a  fine may be imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements regarding an entity s ownership  investment and compensation arrangements for each day for which reporting is required to have been made under the stark law 
the stark law exempts certain business relationships that meet its exception requirements 
however  unlike the anti kickback statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful  a referral for dhs that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the stark law 
we attempt to structure all of our relationships with physicians who make referrals to us in compliance with an applicable exception to the stark law 
in addition to the stark law  many of the states in which we and our franchisees operate have comparable restrictions on the ability of physicians to refer patients for certain services to entities with which they have a financial relationship 
certain of these state statutes mirror the stark law while others may be more restrictive 
we attempt to structure all of our business relationships with physicians to comply with any applicable state self referral laws 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  included administrative simplification provisions that required the department of health and human services hhs to adopt national standards for electronic health care transactions 
at the same time  congress recognized that advances in electronic technology could erode the privacy of health information 
consequently  congress incorporated provisions into hipaa that mandated the adoption of federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information 
in response to the hipaa mandate  in december  hhs published a final regulation in the form of the privacy rule  which became effective on april  this privacy rule set national standards for the protection of health information  as applied to the three types of covered entities health plans  health care clearinghouses  and health care providers who conduct certain health care transactions electronically 
pursuant to the privacy rule  covered entities are required to have standards in place to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information 
the privacy rule establishes a foundation of federal protections for the privacy of protected health information 
the privacy rule does not replace federal  state  or other laws that grant individuals even greater privacy protections  and covered entities are free to retain or adopt more protective policies or practices 
we have implemented the standards set forth in the privacy rule  and believe that we and all of our franchisees are in compliance with the privacy rule or any more stringent federal or state laws relating to privacy 
additionally  the administrative simplification provisions address electronic health care transactions and the security of electronic health information systems 
providers are required to comply with the standards by specific compliance dates established by hhs 
for standards relating to electronic health care transactions  all providers were required to comply by october  the security standards applicable to individually identifiable health information maintained electronically were required to be implemented by april  we were materially compliant with these standards by the applicable compliance date 
the standards for a unique national health identifier for providers used in connection with the electronic healthcare transactions must be implemented by may  we expect to be able to materially comply with this requirement by the applicable compliance date 
penalties for non compliance with the privacy rule and other hipaa administrative simplification provisions range from a civil penalty of for each violation which can total up to  per person per year  to criminal penalties  including up to  and or one year imprisonment  up to  and or five years imprisonment if the offense is committed under false pretenses and up to  and or ten years imprisonment for violating a standard with the intent to sell  transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
in addition to regulating privacy of individual health information and other provisions relating to administrative simplification  hipaa includes several anti fraud and abuse laws  extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and  in addition to medicare and medicaid  to other federal health care programs  and expands the office of inspector general s authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of regulates the manner in which covered outpatient drugs are reimbursed by the medicare program  which could result in lower reimbursement for physicians 
a small portion of the infusion drugs we provide are covered under medicare s durable medical equipment dme benefit 
the payment rates for drugs and services administered by us in this manner generally were not affected by the enacted legislation and will continue to be of the awp in effect as of october  as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  a prescription drug benefit has been added under medicare part d 
under the part d final regulations  the ingredient costs and dispensing fees associated with the provision of home infusion therapies will now be covered under medicare 
prior to the passage of this act  no reimbursement of these costs was available through medicare to beneficiaries 
for eligible medicare beneficiaries  the cost of equipment  supplies and professional services associated with infused covered part d drugs will continue to be reimbursed under part a or part b  as applicable 
for beneficiaries who are dually eligible for benefit under medicare and a state medicaid program  covered infused drugs will be reimbursed under individual state coverage guidelines 
franchise regulation 
we are subject to regulations adopted by the federal trade commission ftc  and to certain state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises 
the ftc franchise rule disclosure requirements and prohibitions concerning franchising and business opportunity ventures and certain state laws require that we furnish prospective franchise owners with a uniform franchise offering circular ufoc containing information prescribed by the ftc franchise rule and applicable state laws and regulations 
there are certain states that also regulate the offer and sale of franchises and  in almost all cases  require registration of the ufoc with state authorities 
we are also subject to a number of state laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
these laws may limit a franchisor s ability to terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause  interfere with the right of free association among franchise owners  disapprove the transfer of a franchise  discriminate among franchisees regarding charges  royalties and other fees  and place new facilities near existing franchisees 
these laws also may limit the duration and scope of non competition provisions 
to date  these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
although bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into congress on several occasions  none have been enacted 
we are not aware of any pending franchise legislation that in our view is likely to significantly affect our operations 
we believe that our operations comply substantially with the ftc franchise rule and applicable state franchise laws 
service marks we have registered with the federal government option care and optionmed  among others  as service marks 
we believe that option care is becoming increasingly recognized by many referral sources as representing a reliable  cost effective source of pharmacy services 
insurance our business of providing specialized pharmacy services and other related home healthcare services may subject us to litigation and liability for damages 
we currently maintain insurance for general and professional liability claims in the amount of million per claim and million in aggregate per policy year  plus million in umbrella coverage 
accordingly  the maximum coverage for a first claim in any policy year is million  and the maximum aggregate coverage for all claims in a policy year is million 
we also require each franchisee to maintain general liability and professional liability insurance covering both the franchise and us  at coverage levels that we believe to be sufficient 
these policies provide coverage on a claims made or occurrence basis and have certain exclusions from coverage 
these insurance policies generally must be renewed annually 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liability claims that may be asserted against us 
in addition  we carry property insurance coverage for the value of the physical assets  including drugs inventory  at all of our leased facilities 
the deductible on our property policies is  per claim  with higher deductibles applicable to certain other losses  such as wind and flood damage 
these policies  which generally must be renewed annually  also include coverage for business interruption 
while we believe our coverage to be sufficient  there can be no assurance that our property insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any and all property losses that we may suffer 
employees as of december   we employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time basis 
of our full time employees  were corporate management and administrative personnel and the remaining  were employees of company owned locations  primarily in clinical  management and administrative positions 
the majority of our part time employees are clinicians due to the nature and timing of the services we provide 
a group of nurses working at our home health agency in portland  oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
no other group of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our employee relations are good 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below  together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
some of the following factors relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate 
other factors relate principally to an investment in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could develop 
other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or evaluated could also adversely affect our company 
if any of the following risks occur  our earnings  financial condition or business could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our revenue and profitability will decline if the pharmaceutical industry undergoes certain changes  including limiting or discontinuing research  development  production and marketing of the pharmaceuticals that are compatible with the services we provide 
our business is highly dependent on the ability of biotech and other pharmaceutical companies to develop  supply and market pharmaceuticals that are compatible with the services we provide 
our revenue and profitability will decline if those companies were to sell pharmaceuticals directly to the public  fail to support existing pharmaceuticals or develop new pharmaceuticals with different administration requirements than our service offerings are currently equipped to handle 
our business could also be harmed if the pharmaceutical industry experiences any of the following developments supply shortages  pharmaceutical recalls  an inability to finance product development because of capital shortages  a decline in product research  development or marketing  a reduction in the retail price of pharmaceuticals  changes in the fda approval process  or government or private initiatives that alter how pharmaceutical manufacturers  health care providers or pharmacies promote or sell products and services 
if we lose relationships with managed care organizations and other non governmental third party payors  we could lose access to a significant number of patients and our revenue and profitability could decline 
we are highly dependent on reimbursement from managed care organizations and other non governmental third party payors 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue came from managed care organizations and other non governmental payors  including self pay patients 
many payors seek to limit the number of providers that supply pharmaceuticals to their enrollees in order to build volume that justifies their discounted pricing 
from time to time  payors with whom we have relationships require that we bid against our competitors to keep their business 
as a result of such bidding process  we may not be retained  and even if we are retained  the prices at which we are able to retain the business may be reduced 
the loss of a payor relationship could significantly reduce the number of patients we serve and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and net income  and a reduction in pricing could reduce our gross margins and our net income 
the loss of our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida would materially decrease our revenue 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue was related to this contract 
the contract is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews annually each september for an additional one year term 
the loss of this contract  or a material reduction in our pricing or pharmaceutical sales under this contract  would materially decrease our revenue and net income 
changes in reimbursement rates from medicare and medicaid for the services we provide may cause our revenue and profitability to decline 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue came from reimbursement by federal and state programs such as medicare and medicaid 
reimbursement from these and other government programs is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements  administrative rulings  interpretations of policy  implementation of reimbursement procedures  retroactive payment adjustments  governmental funding restrictions and changes to or new legislation  all of which may materially affect the amount and timing of reimbursement payments to us 
changes to the way medicare pays for our services may reduce our revenue and profitability on services provided to medicare patients and increase our working capital requirements 
in addition  we are sensitive to possible changes in state medicaid programs as we do business with a number of state medicaid providers 
budgetary concerns in many states have resulted in and may continue to result in  reductions to medicaid reimbursement as well as delays in payment of outstanding claims 
any reductions to or delays in collecting amounts reimbursable by state medicaid programs for our products or services  or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements  could cause our revenue and profitability to decline and increase our working capital requirements 
our actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed results and forecasts 
our actual financial results might vary from those anticipated by us  and these variations could be material 
from time to time we publicly provide earnings guidance 
our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance  as well as other factors  which are beyond our control  and which might not turn out to be correct 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying our projections are reasonable  actual results could be materially different 
our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and estimates  including those identified throughout these risk factors and elsewhere in this report and the documents incorporated by reference 
our gross profit could decrease if there are changes in the calculation of average wholesale price awp for the pharmaceuticals we sell  or if managed care organizations and other private payors replace average wholesale price with a different reimbursement system  such as average sales price asp 
our gross margin rates and our gross profit are largely controlled by our ability to purchase pharmaceutical products at discounted prices and to negotiate profitable managed care contracts 
in many cases  we purchase pharmaceuticals at less than the published awp for those pharmaceuticals 
the awp has been a standard form of pricing often used in the healthcare industry to determine discount and reimbursement amounts 
accordingly  we have contracted with a number of private payors  primarily managed care providers  to sell pharmaceuticals at awp or at a percentage discount off of the awp 
awp for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc a reduction in awp for the products we provide to patients could reduce our revenue and narrow our gross margins 
some managed care providers are adopting asp as the standard measure for determining reimbursement rates in new or renegotiated contracts 
asp based pricing is generally lower than awp based pricing 
to the extent that we are not able to negotiate new asp based contracts with managed care providers that contain gross profit margins comparable to our existing awp based contracts  our revenue and gross profit may be reduced 
we are subject to pricing pressures and other risks involved with third party payors 
competition for patients  efforts by traditional third party payors to contain or reduce healthcare costs  and the increasing influence of managed care payors such as health maintenance organizations  has resulted in reduced rates of reimbursement for home infusion and specialty pharmacy services 
changes in reimbursement policies of governmental third party payors  including policies relating to medicare  medicaid and other federal and state funded programs  could reduce the amounts reimbursed to our customers for our products and  in turn  the amount these customers would be willing to pay for our products and services  or could directly reduce the amounts payable to us by such payors 
pricing pressures by third party payors may continue  and these trends may adversely affect our business 
also  continued growth in managed care plans has pressured healthcare providers to find ways of becoming more cost competitive 
managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and in terms of the portion of the healthcare economy they control 
managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services and to exert pressure to control healthcare costs 
a rapid concentration of revenue derived from individual managed care payors could harm our business 
if we do not adequately respond to competitive pressures  demand for our products and services could decrease 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and subject to relatively few barriers to entry 
local  regional and national companies are currently competing in many of the healthcare markets we serve and others may do so in the future 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and managerial resources than we have 
consolidation among our competitors  such as pharmacy benefit managers pbms and regional and national infusion pharmacy or specialty pharmacy providers could result in price competition and other competitive factors that could cause a decline in our revenue and profitability 
we expect to continue to encounter competition in the future that could limit our ability to grow revenue and or maintain acceptable pricing levels 
some biotech pharmaceutical suppliers in the specialty pharmacy industry have chosen to limit the number of distributors of their products 
if we are not selected as a preferred distributor of one or more of our core products  our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
some biotech pharmaceutical manufacturers attempt to limit the number of preferred distributors that may market certain of their biopharmaceutical products 
if this trend continues  we cannot be certain that we will be selected and retained as a preferred distributor or can remain a preferred distributor to market these products 
although we believe we can effectively meet our suppliers requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other specialty pharmacy companies to retain our position as a distributor of each of our core products 
adverse developments with respect to this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any termination of  or adverse change in  our relationships with a single source product manufacturer or the loss of supply of a specific  single source specialty drug could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we sell biotech pharmaceuticals that are supplied to us by a variety of manufacturers  many of which are the only source of that specific pharmaceutical 
in order to have access to these pharmaceuticals  and to be able to participate in the launch of new biotech pharmaceuticals  we must maintain good working relations with the manufacturers 
most of the manufacturers of the pharmaceuticals we sell have the right to cancel their supply contracts with us without cause and after giving only minimal notice 
one biotech pharmaceutical  synagis  which is manufactured and distributed by medimmune  inc  represented  and of our revenue  respectively  for the fiscal years ended december   and the loss of our relationship with medimmune  inc or with one or more other biotech pharmaceutical manufacturer would reduce our revenue and profitability 
we have recently experienced rapid growth by acquisitions 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business could be disrupted and our operating results could suffer 
our ability to successfully offer our products and services in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process 
in  and combined  we completed fifteen separate pharmacy business acquisitions  ten of which were completed during our growth through acquisitions  combined with the internal growth of our business based on our business plan  may place a strain on our management systems and resources 
this growth has resulted in  and will continue to result in an increase in responsibilities for management 
to accommodate our growth and compete effectively  we will need to continue to enhance  expand and improve our management and our operational and financial information systems and controls  and to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
our personnel  systems  procedures  or controls may not be adequate to support our operations in the future in light of anticipated growth 
in addition  if we focus our financial resources and management attention on the expansion of our operations rather than on our ongoing operations  our financial results may suffer 
if we are unable to acquire additional pharmacy facilities on favorable terms  we will be unable to execute our acquisition and development strategy 
our strategy includes increasing our revenue and earnings through strategic acquisitions of infusion therapy pharmacies and related businesses 
our efforts to execute our acquisition strategy may be affected by our ability to identify suitable candidates and negotiate and close acquisitions 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities  including the acquisition of certain of our franchisees  and expect to complete acquisitions in the future 
the facilities we purchase may require working capital from us during the initial months of operation  depending on whether or not we acquire receivables as part of the acquisition agreement 
we may acquire businesses with significant unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with health care or reimbursement laws and regulations 
while we generally obtain contractual rights to indemnification from owners of the businesses we acquire  our ability to realize on any indemnification claims will depend on many factors  including  among other things  the availability of assets of the indemnifying parties 
in the future  we may not be successful in acquiring pharmacies or in achieving satisfactory operating results at acquired pharmacies  and we may not be able to acquire healthcare businesses that produce returns justifying our related investment 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital resources to fund our acquisitions at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
an impairment of goodwill on our financial statements could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill on our financial statements 
goodwill was recorded because the purchase price was in excess of the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we may not realize the full value of this goodwill 
as such  we evaluate on at least an annual basis whether events and circumstances indicate that all or some of the carrying value of goodwill is no longer recoverable  in which case we would write off the unrecoverable goodwill as a charge against our earnings 
since our growth strategy will likely involve the acquisition of other companies  we may record additional goodwill in the future 
the possible write off of this goodwill could negatively impact our future earnings 
we will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of any intangible assets other than goodwill that meet the criteria specified in the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  such as marketing  customer or contract based intangibles 
the amount allocated to these intangible assets could be amortized over a fairly short period  which may negatively affect our earnings 
as of december   we had goodwill of million  or of our total assets and approximately of stockholders equity 
changes in state and federal government regulation could restrict our ability to conduct our business 
the marketing  sale and purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and provision of healthcare services generally is extensively regulated by federal and state governments 
other aspects of our business are also subject to government regulation 
we believe we are operating our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the applicable regulatory framework is complex  and the laws are very broad in scope 
many of these laws remain open to interpretation and have not been addressed by substantive court decisions 
accordingly  we cannot provide any assurance that our interpretation would prevail or that one or more government agencies will not interpret them differently 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing law can have a dramatic effect on what we can do  our cost of doing business and the amount of reimbursement we receive from governmental third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid 
also  we could be affected by interpretations of what the appropriate charges are under government programs 
some of the healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our activities include the federal anti kickback statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying  offering  receiving  or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase  lease  order  arrange for  or recommend services or goods covered in whole or in part by medicare  medicaid  or other government healthcare programs 
although there are safe harbors under the anti kickback statute  some of our business arrangements and the services we provide may not fit within these safe harbors or a safe harbor may not exist that covers the arrangement 
the anti kickback statute is an intent based statute and the failure of a business arrangement to satisfy all elements of a safe harbor will not necessarily render the arrangement illegal  but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
violations of the anti kickback statute can lead to significant penalties  including criminal penalties  civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship ie  an ownership  investment or compensation relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services dhs that are reimbursable under medicare 
the stark law exempts certain business relationships which meet its exception requirements 
however  unlike the anti kickback statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful  a referral for dhs that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the stark law 
a violation of the stark law is punishable by civil sanctions  including significant fines and exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa provides federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information 
through the adoption of the privacy rule  hipaa set national standards for the protection of health information for providers and others who transmit health information electronically 
in addition to regulating privacy of individual health information  hipaa includes several anti fraud and abuse laws  extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and  in addition to medicare and medicaid  to other federal health care programs  and expands the office of inspector general s oig s authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs 
pharmacies and pharmacists must obtain state licenses to operate and dispense pharmaceuticals 
if we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non resident pharmacies  this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we may become subject to federal and state investigations 
both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies  as well as their executives and managers 
these investigations relate to a wide variety of topics  including referral and billing practices 
further  amendments to the federal false claims act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies 
some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions 
the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services and the department of justice have  from time to time  established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
some of our activities could become the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries 
for example  we have significant medicare and medicaid billings 
in addition  our executives  some of whom have worked at other healthcare companies that are or may become the subject of federal and state investigations and private litigation  could be included in governmental investigations or named as defendants in private litigation  resulting in adverse publicity against us 
we are not aware of any governmental investigations involving any of our company owned facilities or our executives 
a future investigation of us could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us  as well as adverse publicity  and could seriously undermine our ability to compete for business  negotiate acquisitions  hire new personnel and otherwise conduct our business 
we may be subject to liability for the services we offer and the products we sell 
we and other participants in the health care market are  have been and are likely to continue to be subject to lawsuits based upon alleged malpractice  product liability  negligence or similar legal theories  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
a successful claim not covered by our professional liability insurance or substantially in excess of our insurance coverage could cause us to pay out a substantial award 
in addition  we retain liability on claims up to the amount of our deductibles  which generally are  per occurrence 
further  our insurance policy is subject to annual renewal and it may not be possible to obtain liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms  with adequate coverage against potential liabilities  or at all 
also  claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could be a serious distraction to management and could harm our reputation 
labor strikes or similar work stoppages within the companies that provide our local and national distribution services could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we utilize several national delivery companies as an important part of the local and national distribution of our products and services  particularly in the delivery of certain specialty pharmaceutical products 
a portion of the workforce utilized by these delivery companies are members of labor unions 
a labor strike or similar work stoppage within any of the delivery companies that we utilize for distribution could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our image and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 
the majority of our local pharmacy locations are operated by franchisees 
franchisees are independent business owners and are not our subsidiaries or employees 
consequently  the quality of a franchised operation is dependent upon its owner s and manager s 
franchisees may not successfully operate facilities or they may fail to comply with federal and state health care statutes and regulations 
if they do not operate their franchises effectively or do not comply with applicable industry regulations  our image and reputation may suffer which could negatively impact our results of operations 
our gross profit margins may decline if our franchise royalties are reduced 
we rely on royalty payments from our franchisees 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from franchise royalties excluding any acquisition settlement or termination gains 
our franchisees pay royalties on their gross receipts 
because there is no cost of goods sold associated with this revenue  franchise royalties and other fees represent a significant portion of our gross profit 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  royalties and other franchise fees represented  and  respectively  of our gross profit 
if our franchisees encounter business or operational difficulties  our revenue from royalties may be adversely affected 
such difficulties may also negatively impact our ability to sell new franchises 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully attract new franchisees or if our existing franchise owners either do not enter into new franchise agreements with us when their current agreements expire or enter into new franchise agreements with royalty payment rates less favorable to us than current rates  our franchise revenue  gross profit and overall profitability will decline 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our operations 
our success depends upon the availability and performance of our key executives  including our chief executive officer  rajat rai  and our president and chief operating officer  richard m 
smith 
we do not have key person insurance for any of our key executives 
the loss of the services of mr 
rai  mr 
smith or any of our other key executives could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 
the current or future shortage in licensed pharmacists  nurses and other clinicians could adversely affect our business 
the healthcare industry is currently experiencing a shortage of licensed pharmacists  nurses and other healthcare professionals 
consequently  hiring and retaining qualified personnel will be difficult due to intense competition for their services and employment 
any failure to hire or retain pharmacists  nurses or other healthcare professionals could impair our ability to expand or maintain our operations 
the market price of our common stock may experience substantial fluctuations for reasons over which we have little control 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
the stock price and the share trading volume for companies in the healthcare and health services industry is subject to significant volatility 
both company specific and industry wide developments  as well as changes to the overall condition of the us economy and stock market  may cause this volatility 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate up or down substantially based on a variety of factors  including the following future announcements concerning us  our competitors  the pharmaceutical manufacturers and managed care companies with whom we have relationships or the health care market  changes in operating results from quarter to quarter  sales of stock by insiders  changes in government regulations  changes in estimates by analysts  news reports relating to trends in our markets  the seasonal nature of pharmaceuticals we offer  including synagis  acquisitions and financings in our industry  and the overall volatility of the stock market 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
these fluctuations  coupled with changes in our results of operations and general economic  political and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
increases in the per share market price of our common stock in future periods could result in dilution of our earnings per share 
increases in the market price of our common stock may result in dilution of our earnings per share related to the conversion feature of our senior convertible notes 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  our diluted shares must include the dilutive effect of our convertible notes for periods during which the average market price of our common stock exceeds its conversion price per the terms of the notes during a given period 
the conversion price is currently set at per share subject to future adjustment  as needed 
if the average market price of our common stock should exceed the conversion price per share in a given period  our diluted shares would increase  which could reduce our net income per diluted share for such period 
for the fiscal year ending december   the average market price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price of per share and the dilutive effects of the senior convertible notes  which totaled approximately  shares  are included in our diluted earnings per share reported for that period 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds to purchase our outstanding convertible senior notes on the purchase dates or upon a fundamental change or to pay the cash payment due upon conversion 
on each of november   november  and november   holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to purchase  for cash  all or a portion of their senior convertible notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  that date 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or a portion of their notes 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay the principal  or  in certain circumstances  other amounts  in cash 
we may not have sufficient funds for any required repurchase of the notes 
in addition  the terms of any borrowing agreements that we may enter into from time to time may require early repayment of borrowings under circumstances similar to those constituting a fundamental change 
these agreements may also make our repurchase of notes  or the cash payment due upon conversion of the notes  an event of default under the agreements

our acquisitions were accretive to earnings and will solidify our positions in existing markets and establish our position in new markets 
during  we entered into two joint ventures with hospitals  one in portland  oregon and the other in columbus  ohio 
the portland joint venture has provided us a presence in this new market and the columbus joint venture  which represented a merger of our existing business with that of the hospital  solidified our existing position in that market 
we contributed a combined million in cash and million in net operating assets for our interests in these joint ventures 
we have applied the equity method of accounting for these joint ventures 
we sold the assets and ongoing operations of our subsidiary  mbi  during the quarter ended december  mbi developed  marketed and sold pharmacy management software designed specifically for the home infusion industry

mbi generated revenue from external customers of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and posted pre tax losses of approximately   and million  respectively  for those years 
we recognized a  gain from the sale of mbi s assets which was largely offset by costs incurred as part of a day transition period following the sale

while we are able to separately identify our costs between goods and services  we cannot separate our revenue accordingly 
for our typical infusion therapy patient  we provide both pharmaceutical products and nursing and other services 
often  a portion of our revenue consists of a per diem payment that represents a combined reimbursement for certain goods and services 
therefore  discrete revenue from services versus the sale of goods is not available 
specialty pharmacy revenue specialty pharmacy revenue consists of our distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products to patients homes or other non hospital settings such as physician s offices on behalf of manufacturers  managed care companies or  to a lesser extent  government healthcare programs 
our specialty pharmacy revenue is derived from sales by our two company owned  high volume distribution facilities and our company owned pharmacies 
specialty pharmacy revenue also includes fees received from biotech drug manufacturers for providing clinical compliance and patient outcomes data for specific products 
in  our specialty pharmacy revenue was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
a significant percentage of this increase was attributable to the continued growth in sales volume of synagis  a seasonal drug for the prevention of respiratory synctial virus rsv in premature infants  and xolair  a specialty drug for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma 
our synagis revenue reached million in  representing growth of over the prior year 
we partnered with genentech and novartis pharmaceuticals corporation to participate in the launch of xolair in and experienced increases in our xolair revenue throughout and in addition to the increased sales of synagis and xolair  we generated double digit increases in several other specialty therapies due principally to our ongoing sales and marketing efforts  the effect of our acquisitions and continuing increases in the size of the overall market for specialty pharmacy services 
during portions of october and november  our high volume specialty distribution center located in miramar  florida experienced a significant business interruption due to hurricane wilma 
we filed a business interruption insurance claim for lost revenue and gross profit for the period immediately following the hurricane 
operations at this facility returned to normal by december during the first quarter of  we received an insurance settlement  net of applicable deductible  of approximately  related to this claim

on a same store basis  our infusion therapy revenue grew by in over the prior year 
acquisitions and start ups accounted for a increase in infusion therapy revenue 
our overall same store growth rate for the infusion and related services line was 
other revenue other revenue primarily consists of franchise related revenue and software revenue 
franchise related revenue consists of royalties and other fees generated from our franchise network  gains recognized in connection with the settlement of pre existing franchise relationships with franchisees we acquire  fees from the termination of a franchise from the network prior to the scheduled expiration of its underlying franchise agreement  and vendor rebates earned from our franchises purchases under option care s contracts with manufacturers and vendors 
software revenue consists of software license fees  support and training fees generated by our subsidiary  mbi 
for  we recorded other revenue of million representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of the revenue  million consisted of franchise royalties and related fees  of which million were royalties  million were gains recognized in connection with settlement of our pre existing relationships with franchises we acquired and million was franchise early termination fees 
in addition  we recorded million in software licensing and support revenue prior to our sale of mbi late in and a combined million in collection fees for services provided to the sellers of businesses we acquired during the year and for vendor rebates and other miscellaneous revenue 
in the prior year  royalties and related fees totaled million  of which million was royalties and million was from franchise early termination fees 
the million decline in royalties in was attributable to franchise acquisitions and terminations in and while the million increase in other franchise related revenue was primarily related to settlement of pre existing franchise relationships with four of our franchisees acquired during as well as a million early termination fee for one franchise that was terminated from the network 
software related revenue decreased by  in due to our disposal of mbi during the fourth quarter of this  decrease in software related revenue was partly offset by a  gain on our sale of mbi s assets 
for  we recorded other revenue of million representing an increase of  or  over the prior year 
of the revenue  million consisted of franchise royalties and related fees  of which million was royalties and million was franchise early termination fees 
in  royalty revenue was million 
the  decline in the revenue was attributable to franchise terminations in and compared to  software related revenue increased by  in due to increased sales of mbi s iemphsys pharmacy management software 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of the cost of goods sold and services provided to our patients 
cost of goods primarily consists of the cost of infusion and specialty pharmaceutical products  durable medical equipment and ancillary medical supplies provided to our patients 
cost of service includes the salaries  wages and other costs related to our provision of nursing and pharmacy services  as well as our cost to deliver pharmaceutical products and durable medical equipment to our patients 
cost of goods for  our cost of goods was million  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year s million cost of goods 
this increase was primarily related to our million increase in revenue due to acquisitions and same store sales growth 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods decreased from for to for there were three main factors contributing to this overall change to our cost of goods as a percentage of revenue 
the primary factor contributing to the reduction in cost of goods as a percentage of revenue was the higher mix of infusion therapy revenue in as a result of our acquisitions completed during the year 
another significant factor was our million increase in other revenue  the majority of which had no associated cost of goods 
these two factors were partially offset by an increase in the cost of specialty pharmacy products due to a shift in product mix toward certain higher cost products  as well an increase in the purchase cost for ivig specialty pharmaceutical products in due to supply shortages 
for  our cost of goods was million  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year s million cost of goods 
this increase was related to our million increase in revenue over this period 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods increased from for to for this increase was primarily due to shifts in product mix 
during  we generated a higher growth rate for our specialty pharmacy services  which have a higher cost of goods component than our infusion and related healthcare services 
specifically  our growth in xolair revenue in was a major factor in our overall increase in cost of goods as a percentage of revenue 
we receive rebates and vendor administration fees from various drug and medical supply manufacturers and vendors based on the volume of purchases by our company owned pharmacies and our franchised pharmacies and subject to the terms of our underlying agreements with these suppliers 
rebates earned from purchases by our company owned pharmacies are recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
in  vendor rebates reduced our cost of goods by million compared to million in in addition to rebates  we also receive prompt payment discounts from a number of our drug and medical supply vendors 
in  we recorded approximately million in prompt payment discounts compared to million in the prior year 
cost of service our cost of service for was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of service increased slightly from in to in this increase was due to our significant current year increase in infusion therapy services  which have a larger service component than specialty pharmacy services  as well as our acquisition of a home health agency during the fourth quarter of these factors were partly offset by a million increase in other revenue from gains associated with the settlement of pre existing franchise relationships with franchisees we acquired in and a gain from the early termination of one franchise  which had no associated cost of service 
our cost of service for was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of service declined from in to in this decline was due to the increase in specialty pharmacy services  which have a smaller service component than infusion and related healthcare services  and due to our overall increase in revenue which produced certain efficiencies of scale 
gross profit the following table sets forth the gross profit margin defined as gross profit divided by total revenue  expressed as a percentage for each of our service lines for the periods indicated years ended december  gross profit margin specialty pharmacy infusion and related healthcare services other overall gross profit margin in  our gross profit was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the prior year 
the overall increase in our gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in the relative mix of infusion and related healthcare revenues  which has a lower cost of goods component than the specialty pharmacy services  and an increase in other revenue 
overall  our infusion and related healthcare services gross profit margin was remained steady at in compared to in our specialty pharmacy gross profit margin declined from in to in this decrease in gross profit margin percentage was due to our continued growth in revenue from higher cost drugs such as xolair and synagis  as well as a significant increase in the cost of immune globulin ivig products in in  our gross profit was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the prior year 
the overall decline in our gross profit margin was related to a shift in business mix  as our growth in specialty pharmacy revenue outpaced our growth in infusion and related healthcare services 
the decline in specialty pharmacy gross profit margin from in to in was due to our growth in revenue from higher cost drugs  such as xolair and human growth hormone therapies 
our infusion and related healthcare services gross profit margin increased slightly from in to in continuing cost containment efforts for our infusion drugs were a contributing factor to this increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses for  our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increased mix of infusion services  which have greater infrastructure needs and produce higher sg a costs  and an increase in corporate investments to support various strategic initiatives 
of the million increase  million was in wages and related expenses  which increased by approximately over the prior year 
the increase in wages was due in part to new hires made in connection with acquisitions completed during as well as continued growth within our existing locations as the total number of employees at company owned locations increased by from in addition  staffing levels at our corporate office increased by in as we continued to expand our infrastructure to accommodate current and future growth in our business 
fees for outside professional services increased million over the prior year  of which million was attributable to various projects designed to improve operations and produce efficiencies that will benefit future periods  while  was directly related to acquisitions we completed during building rent and related costs increased by  over the prior year  as we increased the total square footage of our facility space by approximately  primarily due to building leases assumed in connection with acquisitions completed during for  our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of this million increase  million was in wages and related expenses  which increased by approximately over the prior year 
wages increased due to new hires and salary cost of living adjustments  though this increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits costs due to redesign of our employee health insurance plans and lower claims experience in the current year 
building rent and related costs increased by  over the prior year  as we increased the total square feet of our facility space by to accommodate business growth 
our marketing and promotional expenses increased by  in compared to as a result of our increased focus on sales and marketing efforts in depreciation and amortization for  our depreciation and amortization expense of assets not directly utilized in the delivery of goods and services was million  an increase by  or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to assets added in connection with acquisitions completed during for  our depreciation and amortization expense of assets not directly utilized in the delivery of goods and services was million  a decrease of  or  over the decrease was primarily due to the write down of certain software development costs during related to an internally developed purchasing software system that was subsequently replaced with a lower cost system 
provision for doubtful accounts in  our provision for doubtful accounts was million  or of revenue 
this represents an increase of million from the million provision for doubtful accounts in  due primarily to our increase in total revenues 
in general  we record a higher provision for doubtful accounts for revenue generated from our locally delivered services than from our central distribution facilities 
this difference in provision rates reflects the difference in collection risk involved in these services as the services from our central distribution facilities are billed under pharmacy benefits whereas the services from our local pharmacies are typically billed under major medical benefits and typically require higher patient co payments and deductibles 
the increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue from in to in was due primarily to the net addition of eleven local pharmacy locations  thereby increasing the relative mix of revenues with higher associated collection risk 
in  our provision for doubtful accounts was million  or of revenue 
this represents a significant decline from the million provision for doubtful account in  which included a special provision of million related to our texas offices 
the decline in provision for doubtful accounts in versus was due to performance improvement in our texas offices and a proportionally greater increase in revenue billed under pharmacy benefits which have a lower collection risk 
interest income expense  net in  we recorded approximately  in net interest income compared to net interest income of  in the prior year 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes  due we recorded million in interest expense on the notes during our short term investments and cash reserves generated interest income of million in due to an overall increase in market interest rates during the year 
in  we recorded approximately  in net interest income compared to net interest expense of  in the prior year 
positive operating cash flow and minimal debt throughout most of the year allowed us to generate more interest income than interest expense in we recorded  in interest expense on the convertible senior notes during november and december however  the cash generated from the convertible notes offering earned interest from short term investments to offset this expense 
income tax provision for the year  our provision for income taxes was million on pre tax income of million  compared to provision for income taxes of million on million of pre tax income in this equates to a provision rate in compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in our provision rate was primarily due to an increase in tax exempt interest income from our investments during we anticipate that our effective income tax rate for will decrease slightly as compared to due to the implementation of tax restructuring initiatives 
for the year  our provision for income taxes was million on pre tax income of million  compared to provision for income taxes of million on million of pre tax income in this equates to a provision rate in compared to for the prior year 
while our effective federal income tax rate increased slightly in due to our increase in pre tax income  this increase was more than offset by a decline in our effective state income tax rate 
this decline was primarily due to changes in the profitability of our operations in various states compared to the prior year 
net income and net income per share our net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally due to our revenue growth during the year  which was the result of our focused sales and marketing efforts  the ten acquisitions we completed during and gains associated with settlement of pre existing franchise relationships with four of the businesses we acquired  as well as franchise early termination fees 
our diluted earnings per share was in compared to in  an increase of 
total diluted shares increased from million in to million in primarily due to new shares issued under our stock incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan  as well as the  share dilutive effect of our convertible senior notes 
our notes are considered dilutive if the average market price of our stock exceeds the conversion price  which was set at per share as of december  we completed a for split of our common stock effective march  for stockholders of record on march  all share and per share amounts in this form k have been adjusted to reflect the pro forma effects of this split 
our net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to our continued revenue growth during the year  resulting from our focused sales and marketing efforts  along with cost containment efforts and operational improvements related to collection of accounts receivable 
as a result of focused sales efforts  our revenue grew by and our gross profit increased by over we resolved the operational issues that led to our bad debt charge of million and restructuring charge of million recorded in in  our diluted earnings per share was compared to in  an increase of 
total diluted shares increased slightly from million in to million in primarily due to new shares issued under our stock incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan as well as an increased dilutive effect of options outstanding  partially offset by our purchases of treasury stock 
accounts receivable the following table sets forth our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding as of december for each year presented dollar amounts in thousands trade accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts  as percentage of trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding days sales outstanding dso is based on trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  and is calculated using the exhaustion method  whereby the net accounts receivable balance is exhausted against each preceding month s or partial month s net revenue 
the dso calculation excludes revenue not related to patient care  such as franchise royalties and other fees and software license and support revenue  and trade accounts receivable purchased in business acquistions 
the following tables set forth the percentage breakdown of our trade accounts receivable by aging category and by major payor type as of december for each year presented accounts receivable by aging category aged days aged days aged days aged over days total accounts receivable by major payor type managed care and other payors medicare and medicaid total as of december   our trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million compared to million as of december  this increase in accounts receivable was related to our revenue growth and increase in days sales outstanding during our revenue for the quarter ended december  was million  which was higher than our revenue of million recorded in the corresponding prior year quarter 
during  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts totaling million and wrote off accounts totaling million 
approximately  of the current year bad debt write offs includes various accounts we reserved in when we recorded a bad debt charge of million related to our texas locations 
our days sales outstanding dso is calculated using the exhaustion method for our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
our dso increased from days as of december  to days as of december  this increase was due in part to a higher mix of infusion and local pharmacy business  which tends to have a slightly longer collection cycle  as well as non recurrent interruptions in our billing processes at both of our company owned  high volume specialty pharmacy distribution centers during the fourth quarter of as of december  and  respectively  and of our accounts receivable was related to government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
the remaining and of our accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively  was due from managed care organizations and other third party payors 
our most significant managed care contract  with blue cross and blue shield of florida  accounted for approximately and of our accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively 
this contract produced and of our revenue for the years and  respectively 
our accounts receivable under this contract are proportionately low relative to revenue due to quick payment terms in the contract and the fact that a high percentage of our revenue under this contract is for specialty pharmacy services 
the aging composition of our accounts receivable at december  was improved as compared to the composition a year earlier 
as of december   of our accounts receivable was aged days or less as compared to of our accounts receivable as of december  and this shift in accounts receivable aging was due in part to the increase in the sales of the synagis specialty drug during the fourth quarter of  which increased by over the prior year quarter  and also due to the effect of acquisitions we completed in the third and fourth quarters of as of december   our trade accounts receivable  net of bad debt reserves  was million compared to million as of december  this increase in accounts receivable was related to our revenue growth during our revenue for the quarter ended december  was million  which was higher than our revenue of million recorded in the corresponding prior year quarter 
during  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts totaling million and wrote off accounts totaling million 
the bad debt write offs include various accounts we reserved in when we recorded a bad debt charge of million in response to operational problems in our texas locations 
actual collections in for our texas offices approximated the estimates we made in when we recorded the million special provision for doubtful accounts 
an insignificant percentage of our accounts are due from individual patients 
co payments tend to be small and insignificant in our business  and we typically collect any co payments before or upon delivery of products and services to the patient in order to minimize collection risk

the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on our common stock market price and other conditions 
the notes cannot be redeemed by us before november  on each of november   november  and november   the holders can require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes for their principal amount plus accrued interest 
at any time on or after november   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes we redeem  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
we incurred deferred financing costs of million related to this offering  consisting of underwriting  legal and other related costs 
these costs are being amortized over a five year period 
our total working capital decreased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the primary cause of this decrease was the million in cash paid for acquisitions during  the majority of which was allocated to long term assets  as well as million in cash paid to establish our interest in two joint ventures with hospitals 
the decrease was partly offset by our revenue growth during which produced a million increase in accounts receivable at december  compared to december  we had one outstanding letter of credit at december  in the amount of million related to our general and professional liability insurance coverage policy for the twelve month period ended june  we maintain a compensating cash balance of million to cover this letter of credit 
we expect to be released from our obligation to maintain this letter of credit during as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling million 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for each of the last four years and anticipate remaining cash flow positive from continuing operations in our only material debt as of december  was our million of convertible senior notes  due we intend to fund our future capital needs through operating cash flows and existing cash reserves 
in the event that additional capital is required beyond our operating cash flow and the proceeds of the notes  we may not be able to obtain such capital from other sources on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business strategy includes the selective acquisition of additional infusion pharmacies and other related healthcare businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  and view acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy 
we have typically paid cash for our acquisitions  with the majority of the purchase price paid at closing 
for future acquisitions  we may utilize cash  common stock  or a combination of the two to pay the purchase price 
we may require additional capital in excess of our current availability in order to complete future acquisitions 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash flows our cash balance decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to payments for business acquisitions and partly offset by net sales of short term investments and positive cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows remained positive at million for the year  offset in part by the initial operating cash requirements of acquisitions made during the latter part of  particularly those for which we did not acquire rights to their pre acquisition accounts receivable 
we used million in investing activities in  of which million was spent on business acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  partly offset by our net sale of million of short term investments  such as commercial paper 
in  we generated million from the issuance of common stock primarily received through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of vested stock options  and paid million in dividends under our dividend policy established by the board of directors in may cash provided by operations for  we generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
the primary source of our positive operating cash flow in was our net income of million  partly offset by an increase in our trade accounts receivable  as evidenced by a five day increase in our days sales outstanding dso increased from days as of december  to days as of december  this dso increase was due in part to a higher mix of infusion and local pharmacy business  which tends to have a slightly longer collection cycle  as well as non recurrent interruptions in our billing processes at our company owned  high volume specialty pharmacy distribution centers during the fourth quarter of in addition  for five of our ten acquisitions in  we did not purchase accounts receivable and therefore had to finance their initial operating cash requirements  resulting in negative initial operating cash flows for those businesses 
for  we generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
the primary cause of our positive operating cash flow in was our net income of million 
through effective billing and collections efforts and a continued shift in mix toward specialty pharmacy services  we were able to reduce our days sales outstanding from days as of december  to days as of december   helping us maintain strong operating cash flow in a year in which our revenue grew by 
our operating cash flow in also benefited from a net increase in deferred income tax liabilities and our utilization of a large income tax overpayment from the prior year 
net cash flow provided by operations in was million 
our net income in the year and improved cash collection performance  which led to a reduction in our days sales outstanding  were the main reasons for the improvement 
overall collections of accounts receivable throughout the company were strong  despite difficulties in some of our texas locations 
we re focused on billing and collections in  reducing our gross accounts receivable from million as of december  to million at december  in addition to improvements in our overall billing and collection performance  the decline in accounts receivable and increase in operational cash flow was also due to the increase in specialty pharmacy services revenue as compared to infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
specialty pharmacy revenue tends to have a shorter collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
cash used in investing activities in  we used million in cash in investing activities 
we used million to complete ten business acquisitions and invest in two joint ventures with hospitals  and used million for the purchase of equipment and other fixed assets  of which million was for revenue generating medical equipment and the remainder was for infrastructure items 
offsetting these expenditures was million received from the sale of our mbi business and million generated from the net sale of short term investments 
these short terms investments primarily consist of commercial paper and other highly liquid instruments having maturities of three months or more at the time of purchase 
most of our short term investments have periodic interest rate adjustments  generally every or days  based on changing market conditions 
in  we used million in cash in investing activities 
we used million of the net proceeds generated from the convertible senior notes to purchase short term investments 
in addition  we used million for the purchase of equipment and other fixed assets  of which million was for revenue generating medical equipment and the remainder was for infrastructure items 
we also used million for business acquisitions and  to acquire other long term assets 
we completed five small acquisitions during  all of which helped us consolidate our market position in existing markets that we serve 
we used million in cash in investing activities in the primary use of cash was for acquisition payments 
we used million in cash during the year  of which million was related to additional consideration for prior year acquisitions and  was for a small acquisition completed in march in addition  we spent million for the purchase of equipment and other long term assets 
cash used in financing activities in  we generated million from financing activities 
during  we generated million from the issuance of stock to participants in our employee stock purchase plan and from employees who exercised vested stock options 
this was offset by our use of million to pay dividends to our common stockholders and  to pay professional fees related to our million offering of senior notes in november in  we generated million from financing activities 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes  due the purpose of the offering was to finance acquisitions  stock repurchases  and working capital and other general corporate needs 
we paid million in underwriting  legal and other fees related to this offering 
these fees will be amortized over a five year period 
during  we generated million from the issuance of stock related to our employee stock plans 
this was offset by our use of million in cash to acquire treasury stock and million to pay dividends to our common stockholders 
we also used  for scheduled installments on capital leases and other debt 
in  we used million cash in financing activities 
the primary use of cash in was to pay off the outstanding balance on our credit facility with jp morgan business credit corporation  which was million as of december  we were able to pay off this balance due to our positive operating cash flow of million in in  in addition to the use of cash to pay down our credit facility balance  we also used approximately  at the end of the year to repurchase shares of our common stock 
offsetting these uses of cash  we generated million in cash in from the issuance of common stock to participants in our employee stock purchase plan and from our employees stock option exercises throughout the year 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised share based payment on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
initially  the sec announced that sfas no 
r must be adopted in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  subsequently  on april   the sec announced that calendar year end companies will be allowed to delay implementation of the new standard until their first interim period beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
r as of january  as permitted by sfas no 
 we have been accounting for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we generally have recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our cash flows or liquidity 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on our future net income cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and on required changes in the method of computation of fair value 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf addresses the accounting for a preexisting relationship in a business combination 
the task force reached a consensus that a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
such a business combination should be considered a multiple element transaction with one element being the business combination and the other element being the settlement of the preexisting relationship 
settlement of the preexisting relationship should be treated independent of the business combination  and the gain or loss recorded from such settlement should be the same as it would be absent the business combination 
the task force further determined that the acquisition of a right that the acquirer had previously granted to the acquired entity to use the acquirer s recognized or unrecognized intangible assets for example  rights to the acquirer s trade name under a franchise agreement or rights to the acquirer s technology under a technology licensing agreement should be included as part of the business combination  and should be valued as a separately identifiable intangible asset in the allocation of purchase price 
the task force also reached consensus that a settlement loss or gain should be recognized in conjunction with the effective settlement of a lawsuit or executory contract in a business combination  unless otherwise specified in existing authoritative literature 
the following disclosures should be made for business combinations between parties with a preexisting relationship a the nature of the preexisting relationship  b the measurement of the settlement amount of the preexisting relationship  if any  and the valuation method used to determine the settlement amount  and c the amount of any settlement gain or loss recognized and its classification in the statement of operations 
in accordance with eitf  we have recorded other revenue of million in connection with acquisitions of franchise locations made during as described in our disclosure of accounting for preexisting relationships in business combinations in note u to our consolidated financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf issue the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
contingently convertible instruments are instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingently convertible or exercisable based on a a market price trigger or b multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger and the instrument can be converted or share settled based on meeting the specified market condition 
a market price trigger is a market condition that is based at least in part on the issuer s own share price 
the task force reached a consensus that contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the task force observed that there is no substantive economic difference between contingently convertible instruments and conventional convertible instruments with a market price conversion premium 
accordingly  the task force concluded that the treatment for diluted eps should not differ because of a contingent market price trigger 
the consensus reached by the task force should be applied to reporting periods ending after the effective date of october  for contingently convertible instruments outstanding at the date of adoption of this consensus and whose terms have not been modified since the date of issuance  prior period diluted earnings per share should be restated to conform to the guidance in this consensus for comparative purposes 
we adopted the guidance from eitf beginning with the quarterly period ended march  this eitf applies to our million of convertible senior notes due  which were issued in november we have applied the guidance from eitf to our calculation of diluted shares and net income per diluted share for the year ended december  at december   the weighted average market price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price for dilution of 
our contingently convertible debt accounted for  shares of the total million share increase in diluted shares for the year ended december  emerging issues task force eitf issue determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either a placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or b acquired in a business combination 
the task force reached a consensus that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
the task force also concluded that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
the consensus reached by the task force should be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  since we were already recording the amortization of leasehold improvements in accordance with the principles of eitf  adoption of the guidance in this eitf had no material affect on our accounting policies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and their related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the following should be read in conjunction with note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies and with the other notes to consolidated financial statements healthcare services revenue recognition and contractual adjustments our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and the provision of related nursing services to patients outside the hospital at alternate site settings 
most of this revenue is billed under managed care or other contracts  with a smaller amount billed under government healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
we bill upon receipt of all required documentation from payors  physicians and our staff 
at the end of any period  a portion of our earned revenue remains unbilled awaiting completion of all documentation requirements 
billed and unbilled revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments based on our interpretation of the terms of each managed care contract or government contract or pricing schedule  as loaded into our computerized billing and pharmacy management software systems 
in most cases  our contractual adjustments are calculated automatically by our billing system when the claim is billed  subject to review by the biller 
if our billing system cannot automatically generate the contractual adjustment for a given claim  we calculate the contractual adjustment manually and key the adjustment into our billing system when the claim is billed 
the contractual adjustments on unbilled amounts must be estimated manually through claim by claim analysis of the unbilled claims  by applying historical contractual adjustment percentages to the gross unbilled amounts  or a combination of the two methods 
the accuracy of our recorded net revenue is subject to the accuracy of payor information on file for each patient  and is also subject to our correct interpretation of each underlying contract with respect to reimbursement rates for the drugs and services we provided 
if changes or corrections to our estimates of net revenue prove to be necessary  we adjust net revenue in the period that such changes or corrections are identified 
such adjustments may have a positive or negative impact on the revenues and results of operations reported for those subsequent periods 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant to our statements of income 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are reported net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from private insurance carriers and government healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process  with each payor having its own claim requirements 
the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable is dependent upon complete and accurate patient intake  timely submission of clean claims to payors  and timely and effective follow up on outstanding claims 
our collection process involves multiple steps 
the first step is to bill each claim correctly  with proper coding  after having received all prerequisite authorizations from the patient s physician and insurance company  as applicable 
for claims submitted electronically  we receive electronic acceptance of the claim from the insurance company or governmental agency responsible for paying the claim 
this helps to assure collection of the account 
for mailed insurance claims or those for which electronic confirmation of acceptance is unavailable  the billing staff member responsible for that claim will contact the payor if payment is not received promptly 
the billing staff member will inquire as to the status of the claim  and will re bill the claim or provide additional information as requested by the payor 
upon rebilling  the billing staff member will contact the payor to confirm receipt of the re billed claim  and will follow up periodically until payment is received 
we write off accounts receivable as bad debts after all collection efforts have been exhausted  according to the following procedures 
our billing staff members review the status of their unpaid claims on a regular basis 
during that review  the billing staff member will identify the reason for non payment of a given claim 
should the reason relate to a correctable error with the claim itself  or incomplete or inadequate documentation provided to the payor  the billing staff member will attempt to address those issues and re submit a corrected claim or provide additional information to the payor  as appropriate 
in the event the claim error or documentation error cannot be corrected  the allowed time to correct and re submit the claim has expired  or the claim is not paid due to a payor related issue such as bankruptcy  the billing staff member will submit a formal request for write off 
the appropriate supervisor will review the request and authorize the claim to be written off if that supervisor agrees that the account is truly uncollectable 
the identity of the appropriate supervisor to authorize a write off is determined based on the reporting structure within each office and based on the dollar amount to be written off  with higher level authorization required for larger dollar write offs 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on several factors  including our past accounts receivable collection history  the aging of our accounts receivable at the end of each period as reported to us through our computerized billing systems  our mix of business  and the financial condition of our payors 
we evaluate historical write off percentages by aging category to help us determine the appropriate reserve needed at each balance sheet date based on the aging of our receivables at that date 
we also take into account certain internal factors  such as computer systems conversions  office acquisitions and consolidations  and operational changes within our billing and reimbursement function 
although we believe that our estimation of the net value of our accounts receivable is reasonable  we continually monitor our accounts receivable and our methods for calculating the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  and we adjust our allowances and calculation methods as needed 
if actual collections differ from our estimates  we may need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill from our acquisitions equal to the excess of the total cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective january  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test our goodwill at least annually for impairment 
since we operate in one business segment  we test for goodwill impairment on a company wide basis 
therefore  our method of impairment testing consists of comparing the market value of our company to its book value 
the market value is equal to the current value per share of our common stock  times the total number of shares outstanding 
we test goodwill for impairment each october st  or whenever we identify events or conditions that could potentially result in impairment of our goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements and managed care contracts 
the managed care contracts are amortized straight line over periods of generally three years and the non compete agreements are amortized straight line over their contractual terms 
these amortization periods equal the shorter of the estimated useful lives or their contractual term 
franchise settlement gains and losses we periodically acquire existing franchise locations prior to the termination of their franchise agreements 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination  we are required to separately value the settlement of our preexisting relationship with the franchise location prior to accounting for the business combination 
a gain or loss on the settlement should be recorded as it would be absent the business combination 
these gains or losses are measured as the difference between the present value of estimated future royalty payments foregone under the terminated franchise agreements and the estimated market value of a new franchise agreement 
any excess over the current market value is recorded as a gain in other revenue and any shortfall is recorded as a loss within operating expenses 
the present value of the future royalty payments is measured from the date of the acquisition through the remaining life of the terminated franchise agreement  is based on contractual royalty fee rates contained within the franchise agreement and is discounted at a rate that approximates our average cost of capital 
included in the calculation of the future royalty payments are estimated growth rates based on historical trends 
the market value of a new franchise agreement is measured as the present value of future royalty payments calculated utilizing current market royalty fee rates over the remaining life of the seller s franchise agreement  also discounted at a rate that approximates our average cost of capital 
to the extent that the present value of the royalty fee rates in the terminating franchise agreement differs from the current market fee rates at the time of the acquisition  a gain or loss on settlement is recorded 
computer software developed costs software developed for sale to external customers our subsidiary  mbi  internally developed a computer software program  iemphsys  designed specifically for management of home infusion pharmacy businesses 
iemphsys was designed both for external sale to independent home infusion businesses and for internal use by our company owned pharmacies 
in the quarter ended december   we sold the assets of mbi  including the iemphsys product 
however  we will continue to use and modify a customized version of the iemphsys software for our purposes  as needed see also software developed for internal use only as described below 
we accounted for software designed for sale to external customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
accordingly  the costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility for the software program were capitalized 
these costs included coding and testing performed subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalization of the software program costs ceased when the product became available for general release to customers 
the annual amortization expense for the software program was computed using the greater of a the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated life of the product  including the period being reported on 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized capitalized costs of the software program were compared to its net realizable value 
if the estimated net realizable value of the software program was less than its unamortized capitalized costs  we wrote off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceeded the net realizable value 
upon our sale of mbi s assets in the quarter ended december   we allocated the remaining unamortized software development costs for the iemphsys software between the product that we sold versus the customized version of the product that we retained the right to use 
the portion of these costs related to the product that we retained will be accounted for as described below under software developed for internal use only  while the remaining unamortized costs of the product that was sold were written off at the time of sale 
software developed for internal use only we have developed and are developing various software products and modifications to products designed exclusively for use by us in the operation of our business 
this includes modifications and enhancements we have made and continue to make to our customized version of the iemphsys software 
such software development projects are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
we account for software development costs for internal use software accounting to the following criteria a computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed  b once the capitalization criteria under the sop have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software project  and interest costs incurred when developing computer software for internal use are capitalized  and c once the product is operative  internal and external training costs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
we amortize capitalized costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software 
we will recognize impairment on the capitalized computer software developed for internal use  if one of the following conditions is present a the internal use software is not expected to provide substantive service potential  b a significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software is used or is expected to be used  c a significant change is made or will be made to the software program  and d costs of developing or modifying internal use computer software significantly exceed the amount originally expected to develop or modify the software 
vendor administration fees revenue we receive vendor administration fees and rebates from various vendors  pharmaceutical manufacturers and group purchasing organizations gpos based on the volume of drug and medical supply purchases made by us and our franchises 
our accounting for such administration fees and rebates is in accordance with the consensus reached in eitf  consideration received from a vendor by a customer or reseller 
a portion of the vendor administration fees and rebates that we receive is related to our purchases  while a lesser portion is earned from purchases made by our franchisees 
the portion related to our purchases is accounted for as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the period in which we completed the applicable purchases  while the portion related to purchases made by our franchisees is accounted for as revenue in our statements of income  because these rebates are not related to our cost of goods sold 
we also receive fees from certain biotech manufacturers for providing patient compliance and clinical outcomes data to them to aid in their evaluation of the efficacy of their products and treatment protocols 
these fees are not based on our purchase of product from these manufacturers  but rather based on the data we return to them 
since these fees relate to services that we are providing to the biotech manufacturers  we account for these fees as revenue in accordance with the guidance in eitf we often need to estimate the amount of our expected rebates and vendor administration and other fees earned in a given period based on our and our franchisees volume of purchases during the applicable period 
further  we may need to estimate the allocation of rebates and vendor administration fees between revenue and cost of goods based on our estimation of the purchases made by us versus the purchases made by our franchisees during the applicable period 
likewise  we may need to estimate the fees due from biotech manufacturers based on the volume of patient compliance and clinical outcomes data that we have provided  or may provide  to them 
we may adjust our estimates in subsequent periods based on amounts paid by and supporting documentation received from our vendors and manufacturers 
such adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations in subsequent periods  though historically such adjustments have not been material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
we had fixed rate debt as of that date primarily comprised of million offering of convertible senior notes  due the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
we utilize a mix of investment maturities based on our anticipated cash needs and evaluation of existing interest rates and market conditions 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were as follows balance in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash cash equivalent investments total cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash equivalent investments consists of highly liquid investments having a maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition 
short term investments consists of commercial paper and other investments having a maturity of greater than three months at time of acquisition 
short term investments also consists of municipal variable rate demand notes  preferred stock and similar instruments with maturities greater than ten years  but which contain provisions for the periodic adjustment of interest rate to market  generally each or days 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
based on our actual cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at december   a basis point decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income by  on an annualized basis
