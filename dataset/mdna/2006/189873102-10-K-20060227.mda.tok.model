during  the company completed construction of a new class c motorhome manufacturing facility in indiana and purchased an existing facility in georgia to expand its manufacturing capacity for travel trailers and fifth wheels 
during  the company acquired two new rv production facilities five miles north of the main complex in middlebury  indiana and sold one smaller facility located in goshen  indiana 
these new manufacturing facilities were acquired to meet increased market demand for the company s travel trailers and fifth wheels and for production of the company s new camping and travel trailer lines

the company s business segments are subject to certain seasonal demand cycles and changes in general economic and political conditions 
demand in the rv and certain portions of the housing and building segments generally declines during the winter season  while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
inflation and changing prices have had minimal direct impact on the company in the past in that selling prices and material costs have generally followed the rate of inflation 
however  in  rapid escalation of prices for certain raw materials combined with a number of price protected sales contracts adversely affected profits in the housing and building segment 
the rv segment was also affected adversely by raw material inflation but to a lesser degree due to material surcharges added to the prices of products sold to dealers

for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less costs to dispose of the applicable assets
