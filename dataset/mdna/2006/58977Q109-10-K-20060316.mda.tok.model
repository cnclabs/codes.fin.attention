item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations have historically been focused on the onshore oil and gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
declines in the existence of conventional exploration projects in very mature producing basins  such as south louisiana and the shallow shelf areas of the gulf of mexico  have impacted the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
this is partly the result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  and partly the result of new projects being smaller in size compared to the decline rates exhibited by the giant fields discovered  generally  prior to the s 
as a result  the company made a shift during and extended what had been a highly successful exploration program during the early s  from drilling purely deep  higher risk  yet higher potential prospects  to place more emphasis on the development of an exploration inventory of shallower  lower risk  repeatable  multi well plays 
this shift was the genesis of two very successful exploration plays thornwell and biloxi marshlands where multiple wells were drilled either just above pressures  or the first sands into geo pressures 
in both instances  the company developed processing and interpretation techniques that identified direct hydrocarbon indicators and developed reserves with probabilities of success levels greater than each 
meridian s management believes that the basin itself still contains both tremendous attributes high producing rates  high cash flows and returns  plus lower lift costs once proved and remaining opportunities for a company  such as meridian  that possesses a unique position in the region a position marked by technical knowledge and expertise  relationships  acreage positions  seismic inventory and data and prospect inventory 
however  the fact remains that the replacement of reserves year after year in this region continues to be more and more difficult under current conditions 
with the recent increase in commodity prices  the industry is now experiencing a new paradigm in domestic exploration 
recent price increases and enhanced technology has enabled the industry  as a whole  to consider domestic exploration projects that were once uneconomic 
these are predominantly classed as unconventional tight gas and resource shale or resource material plays 
the barnett shale field in northern texas is the best  but not the only  example of this type of play 
it is estimated that as much as of current domestic production now stems from accumulation of this nature 
these fields are quite prolific  extend over large areas  but are also very cost sensitive  with breakeven costs often at per mcf or more on large capital investments 
in recognition of the totality of circumstances  including the availability of these styles of play opportunities and the company s high current cash position stemming from its higher producing rate gulf coast properties  in early  meridian s management introduced as a part of its business plan  the further expansion of its exploration program to include the identification and development of unconventional and resource plays into its portfolio 
since that decision  the company has entered into joint ventures and acquired strategic acreage positions in basins recognized for both the unconventional and resource exploration plays 
the first of these was an unconventional or tight gas play in east texas  near the highly prolific double a field  where we own approximately  acres and began to drill our first wells during the first quarter of others include the purchase of two separate acreage positions of approximately  acres and  acres  with plans to extend positions in each  based on the company s research and drilling operations 
the location of the company s resource plays will not be identified until it has had the opportunity to secure control of protective acreage positions within each 
in addition  the company has expanded its technical and business development staff to include a team of experienced professionals and consultants who will be primarily responsible for the further extension of the company s reserve base and reserve life in the unconventional resource plays 
our drilling program for was dominated by exploration in the biloxi marshlands area and exploitation of seismic anomalies in terrebonne parish  under an old d survey that we had reprocessed 
the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita combined to destroy or damage substantial portions of our production facilities across the state  and severely damaged two of the drilling rigs being utilized in the area 
overall  the storms had a very large impact on the timing four months of our drilling activities and an even greater impact on our production volumes for the year 
as reported  none of our personnel suffered physical injuries  and our insurance coverage will handle the substantial portion of costs to replace and repair the damage 
however  the delays  coupled with the underlying decline  decreased the average production to mcfe per day  from mmcfe per day 
from a financial perspective  in we noted the following average daily production mmcfe per day total revenues million net cash provided by operating activities million diluted earnings per share per share debt to total capitalization drilling capital deployed million reserves added from exploration bcfe reserve reductions from adjustments bcfe thibodaux and cl f a since december  when we acquired our first land and seismic positions in the biloxi marshlands project  the company has expended a total of approximately million for all land  seismic  drilling and completions  production facilities and pipelines  over both evaluated and unevaluated areas 
through december   we have received net field cash flow since first production in march  or less than three years  of million  and the project continues to generate significant monthly cash flow  depending on prevailing commodity prices 
in addition  the field continues to provide additional investment opportunities and we expect to keep one drilling rig working in the field during  drilling to additional wells 
early up front seismic and land  drilling and pipeline costs for the entire field has skewed the finding and development cost on an mcfe basis  but we believe this will continue to be reduced as we resume our drilling activities  add new reserves and production therefrom 
for  the company has set its capital budget at approximately million for new prospect opportunities  ranging in depths from shallow to deep  exposing the company to unrisked reserve additions of approximately bcfe 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of commodity price risk management activities utilized to mitigate a portion of the near term effects of this exposure to price volatility 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues  which include oil and natural gas hedging activities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the twelve months ended december   decreased million as compared to revenues due to a decrease in production volumes primarily from natural production declines  mechanical issues on a few wells and from the effects of hurricanes see general above  partially offset by a increase in average commodity prices on a natural gas equivalent basis and the expiration of unfavorable hedge contracts 
our average daily production decreased from mmcfe during to mmcfe for oil and natural gas production volume totaled  mmcfe for  compared to  mmcfe for during  the company s drilling activity was primarily focused in the biloxi marshlands bml project area and the terrebonne parish area of south louisiana

oil and natural gas operating expenses on an aggregate basis increased million to million in  compared to million in on a unit basis  lease operating expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily due to operating expenses associated with new wells  salt water disposal expense in the hornet nest area of bml  and an overall industry wide increase in service costs 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of the decrease in natural gas production  partially offset by a higher natural gas tax rate 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcf effective july  for natural gas 
for the first six months of  and the last six months of  the rate was per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf for the first half of on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes increased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased million during to million compared to million for this was primarily the result of the decrease in production volumes in from levels  partially offset by an increase in the depletion rate as compared to the period 
on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for depletion and depreciation expense on a per mcfe basis increased primarily due to the impact of negative reserve revisions during the year  an overall industry wide increase in drilling  completion and facility costs  and upward revisions of future development costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  increased million to million in compared to million for the year  primarily due to an increase in employee compensation associated with the higher industry wide demand for experienced personnel 
additionally  legal services were higher during as a result of various litigation matters

this liability will continue to be accreted to its future value in subsequent reporting periods 
the company has charged approximately million and million to earnings as accretion expense during and  respectively 
hurricane damage repairs 
this expense of million is related to damages incurred from hurricanes katrina and rita  primarily related to the company s insurance deductible and costs in excess of insured values 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in long term borrowings 
this realized interest savings was due to the conversion of the million convertible subordinated notes into common stock and the net repayments of million on our long term debt

oil and natural gas operating expenses on an aggregate basis increased million to million in  compared to million in on a unit basis  lease operating expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily due to additional operating expenses associated with new wells and facilities in the bml project area and to increased workover activity in the weeks island  ramos and turtle bayou fields during the year  partially offset by savings resulting from sold properties in the latter portion of  combined with other cost savings initiated during severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of an increase in natural gas production and a higher natural gas tax rate  partially offset by a tax refund from louisiana for prior periods 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcf effective july  for natural gas 
for the first six months of  and the last six months of  the rate was per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf for the first half of on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes decreased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for  reflecting a tax refund from louisiana for prior periods

general and administrative expenses  which are net of costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  increased million to million in compared to million for the year  primarily due to an increase in accounting and professional fees associated with implementing the expanded compliance burden required by the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in insurance costs primarily due to additional coverage and to increased production activity 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  general and administrative expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in long term borrowings 
during  the company converted million of convertible subordinated notes into common stock and made net repayments of million on our long term debt 
the reduction in long term debt was partly the result of our august common stock offering

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
as a result  the company began recording long term liabilities representing the discounted present value of the estimated asset retirement obligations with offsetting increases in capitalized oil and gas properties 
this liability will continue to be accreted to its future value in subsequent reporting periods 
the company has charged approximately million and million to earnings as accretion expense during and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a long term liability of million representing the discounted present value of the estimated retirement obligations and an increase in capitalized oil and gas properties of million 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for totaled million or per share  and was charged to earnings in liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was attributable to a million decline in revenue due to lower production  partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher cash expenditures in of approximately million  including hurricane damage repairs 
additionally  approximately million of hurricane expenditures are included in year end accounts receivable  for which we have filed insurance claims 
also  changes in accounts payable when comparing to  resulted in a use of cash of million 
other changes in working capital are due to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures of million 
drilling activity during the latter part of was delayed due to hurricane damage resulting in lower capital expenditures of million when comparing to net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for in  the company paid million of preferred stock dividends  compared to million in also included in were net repayments of million of debt  partially offset by million raised by selling common stock 
see common stock  below 
common stock 
in august  the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the total proceeds of the offering  net of issuance costs  received by the company were approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds from the offering were utilized to repurchase all of the  shares of its common stock that were beneficially owned by shell oil company for million and a portion of the remaining proceeds of that equity offering were used to repay borrowings under the company s senior secured credit agreement 
the repurchased  shares of common stock that were held in treasury stock  subsequent to the offering  were retired as of september  in august  the company completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the total proceeds of the offering  net of issuance costs  received by the company were approximately million 
the company used the majority of these funds to retire million in long term debt  with the remainder of the proceeds being used for exploration activities and other general corporate purposes 
as discussed below  during  approximately million shares of common stock were issued for the early conversion and retirement of the company s convertible subordinated notes and a portion of the series c redeemable preferred stock 
during  an additional million shares of common stock were issued for conversion and retirement of the remaining series c redeemable preferred stock 
current credit facility 
on december   the company amended its credit facility to provide for a four year million senior secured credit facility the credit facility with fortis capital corp  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and bookrunner  comerica bank as syndication agent  and union bank of california as documentation agent 
bank of nova scotia  allied irish banks plc  rzb finance llc and standards bank plc completed the syndication group 
the initial borrowing base under the credit facility was million and it was reaffirmed by the syndication group effective november  as of december   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
the credit facility is subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations on april and october of each year 
in addition to the scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or the company have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  provided that no party can request more than one such redetermination between the regularly scheduled borrowing base redeterminations 
the determination of our borrowing base is subject to a number of factors including  quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  the bank s price assumptions and other various factors unique to each member bank 
our lenders can redetermine the borrowing base to a lower level than the current borrowing base if they determine that our oil and gas reserves  at the time of redetermination  are inadequate to support the borrowing base then in effect 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and by a first priority lien on not less than in the case of an event of default of its present value of proved oil and gas properties 
in addition  the company is required to deliver to the lenders and maintain satisfactory title opinions covering not less than of the present value of proved oil and gas properties 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  limitations on the redemption of preferred stock and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements  all of which the company is in compliance 
the company recently notified the syndication group that a shortfall would exist in the mortgage and the title opinion requirements with respect to the reserve information the company was required to deliver to the syndication group on march  the primary reason for the shortfall was the inclusion of new properties drilled during included in the company s reserve estimates  which were not previously encumbered by mortgages 
accordingly  the syndication group approved a day waiver of the mortgage requirement and a day waiver of the title opinion requirement 
the company expects to be in full compliance within the time periods allowed in the waiver 
under the credit facility  the company may secure either i a an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  or b federal funds based rate plus of  plus an additional to depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base or  ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
at december   the three month libor interest rate was 
the credit facility also provides for commitment fees of calculated on the difference between the borrowing base and the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit under the credit facility 
former credit facility 
in  the company had a million senior secured credit agreement 
in the first nine months of  the company made repayments of million  bringing the outstanding balance to million as of september  on december   the company made a final debt repayment of million  which paid off this senior secured credit agreement in full 
subordinated credit agreement 
the company had a short term subordinated credit agreement with fortis capital corp 
for million that had a maturity date of december  note payments totaling million were paid in  million was paid in  and the remaining million was paid in convertible subordinated notes during june  the company completed private placements of an aggregate of million of its convertible subordinated notes notes due june  the notes were unsecured and contained customary events of default  but did not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest was payable on a quarterly basis 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under this agreement 
during march  the company and the holders of the notes amended the conversion price from to per share 
the notes were convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of the company s common stock  par value  utilizing the conversion price 
the conversion price was subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
the holders of the notes were granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the notes 
during march  the notes were converted into million shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  and included an additional non cash conversion expense of approximately million that was incurred and paid via the issuance of common stock priced at market 
all of the common stock issued in connection with the conversion of the notes was issued under section of the securities act 
redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a private placement under section and regulation d of the securities act totaling million of redeemable convertible preferred stock was completed during may the preferred stock was convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
dividends were payable semi annually in cash or additional preferred stock 
at the option of the company  one third of the preferred shares could be forced to convert to common stock if the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded of the conversion price for out of consecutive trading days on the new york stock exchange 
the preferred stock was subject to redemption at the option of the company after march  and mandatory redemption on march  the holders of the preferred stock were granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock 
in the last quarter of  million of preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
in  a total of million of preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
during the first six months of  the company completed the conversion of all of the remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock to common stock with million of stated value being converted into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  production facilities  and related drilling and workover activities 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory in order to capitalize on periods of high commodity prices 
the capital expenditures plan is currently forecast at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan utilizing cash flow from operations 
when appropriate  excess cash flow from operations beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan will be used to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries or direct payment of debt 
sale of properties 
during  the company sold certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana for approximately million 
the sale was comprised of approximately bcfe proved developed reserves and bcfe of undeveloped reserves 
benefits of the sale include the reduction of total debt by an additional million resulting in an immediate savings in interest costs on the company s senior bank debt  the elimination of million in future capital expenditures associated with the properties  and the elimination of over million in annual lease operating expenses 
cash obligations 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than after one year years years total short and long term debt    interest    non cancelable operating leases   total contractual cash obligations    dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
for the year  million of dividends were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during of which all was paid in during the first six months of  the company completed the conversion of all of the remaining outstanding shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock  with million of stated value being converted into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
for the year ended december   million of dividends were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during  of which million was paid in cash in july and million was paid in cash in january during  dividends of million were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during  of which million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock and million was paid in cash in january critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
changes in the quantities of our reserves could significantly impact the company s provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in reserves would have increased our provision for the year by approximately  however  a increase in our reserves would have decreased our provision for the year by approximately 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
at december   we had million allocated to unevaluated oil and natural gas properties 
a increase or decrease in the unevaluated oil and natural gas properties balance would have increased or decreased our provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties by approximately for the year ended december  full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  after deducting the asset retirement obligation  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
due to the imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
at december   we had a cushion ie the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs of million before tax 
a increase in prices would have increased our cushion by approximately 
a decrease in prices would have decreased our cushion by approximately 
our hedging program would reduce some of the impact of a price decline 
price risk management activities 
the company follows the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted fas effective january  the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various derivative contracts 
these contracts allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by fas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized a gain of  during the year ended december   and a loss of  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the change in estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas contracts was an unrealized loss of million million net of tax which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the loss deferred in other comprehensive income could potentially lower gross revenues in the contract agreements expire at various dates through july  net settlements under these contract agreements reduced oil and natural gas revenues by  and  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
new accounting pronouncements 
on september   the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the application of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations aros  by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
pursuant to sab  oil and gas producing companies that have adopted sfas should exclude the future cash outflows associated with settling aros aro liabilities from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for the purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
in addition  estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  that have been capitalized aro assets should be included in the amortization base for computing depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
disclosures are required to include discussion of how a company s ceiling test and depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations are impacted by the adoption of sfas sab was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after october  since our adoption of sfas on january   we have calculated the ceiling test and our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in accordance with the interpretations set forth in sab  therefore  the adoption of sab had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

on january  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility 
since interest charged on borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 
hedging contracts from time to time  meridian addresses market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
all of the company s current hedging contracts are in the form of costless collars 
the costless collars provide the company with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly based on the nymex futures contract 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of the company during the periods presented 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the hedging agreements 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the new york mercantile exchange future prices for the applicable trading months 
the fair value of our hedging agreements is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the estimated fair value of our hedging agreements as of december   is provided below see the company s website at www
