glossary of terms we report our reserves to two separate standards to meet the requirements for reporting in both canada and the united states us 
canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our resources and reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify and reconcile them as appropriate to conform to industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the parallels and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically reserve mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral the term probable mineral reserve refers to the reserve economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of natural  solid  inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of resource a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of resource a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 
inferred mineral the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of resource a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination thereof  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized the term mineralized material refers to material that is material not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
for industry guide purposes this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
industry guide does not require designation of a qualified person

gold sales and production ghana has been a significant gold producing country for over years with anglogold ashanti s obuasi mine and the underground mine at prestea historically being the two major producers 
several other areas in ghana have also produced significant amounts of gold 
the gold industry in ghana is currently experiencing growth in exploration and development and gold production 
annual gold production in ghana has exceeded million ounces in recent years and is expected to increase as planned developments and expansions now underway reach the production stage 
all of our gold production is sold to a south african gold refinery 
our gold is sold in the form of dore bars which average approximately gold by weight with the remaining portion being primarily silver 
revenue is recognized when title is transferred at the refinery 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of delivery to the refinery 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

our ore processing plant and open pit mine at wassa were completed and placed in service on april   and we are currently carrying out construction of a sulfide ore processing facility at bogoso prestea 
if the expansion and development plans at bogoso prestea are completed as expected in late and assuming a full year of production from the sulfide plant during  our annualized production is expected to increase to  ounces of gold in achievement of this target is subject to numerous risks 
see the discussion of risk factors below 
we also conduct gold exploration in west africa and south america investing approximately million in such activities during in ghana  we are actively seeking to expand reserves around our existing mines  and we are planning to commence exploration activities with respect to the st 
jude properties in we employ a number of different strategies to achieve our exploration goals including the following o we maintain a staff of geologists in ghana responsible for exploring for new resources in ghana and for developing new reserves in areas around the existing operations  o we contract with geologic consultants who advise us on existing holdings and who seek to identify new exploration opportunities  o we have purchased equity ownership in gold exploration companies that use the equity funds provided by us to explore in their areas of expertise  o we provide funding to joint venture partners that use our funding to conduct active exploration efforts  and o we maintain an international exploration group that carries out work on various properties in the guiana shield area of south america and in other areas of africa outside of ghana 
our assets bogoso prestea property we own and operate the bogoso prestea gold mine in southwest ghana 
ore is currently mined from the plant north open pit surface operation at prestea and trucked approximately kilometers to the bogoso processing plant where the ore is processed 
the current nominal capacity of the bogoso processing plant is approximately million tonnes per year 
the bogoso processing plant utilizes cil technology along with gravity and flotation processes to separate gold from the ore 
cil  gravity and flotation technologies are well known and are widely used for treating gold ores 
in addition to the mine and processing plant facility  bogoso prestea s assets include a fleet of mining equipment  numerous ancillary facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways  administrative offices and a residential complex 
historical gold output at the bogoso processing plant has typically ranged between  and  ounces per year 
see the gold production and unit costs table below for additional details on historical production and operating costs 
a new million tonne per year bio oxidation processing plant utilizing proprietary bioxpp r technology is currently under construction at bogoso 
the new facility is located next to the existing bogoso plant and will process refractory sulfide ores from the bogoso and prestea properties as well as from other deposits in the local area 
the currently existing plant will continue to process oxide and certain non refractory ores 
the two side by side plants will have a combined capacity of approximately million tonnes of ore per annum and should yield approximately  ounces of gold per annum once construction is completed in late mampon the mampon deposit  located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plant  was acquired in as part of the dunkwa property acquisition 
mampon is an undeveloped gold deposit with million tonnes of mineral reserves at an average grade of g t most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods 
development of this deposit as a satellite to our bogoso prestea property is scheduled to begin in pampe the pampe deposit is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plant 
while we have owned the rights to pampe for several years  drilling during identified an indicated mineral resource of million tonnes at an average grade of g t  most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods 
development of this deposit as a satellite to our bogoso prestea property is scheduled to begin in late prestea underground the prestea underground is located directly beneath the prestea property 
it consists of a large underground gold mine that operated for over years  under a number of former owners  producing a total of approximately nine million ounces of gold prior to its closure in early we are continuing to conduct exploration and development drilling and carry out engineering  geological and economic analysis of the mine to determine if it can be reopened on a profitable basis 
the mine includes several useable shafts and several kilometers of underground workings on numerous levels extending as deep as  meters below the surface 
wassa property we own and operate the wassa gold mine in southwest ghana 
the mine includes an open pit mine  a cil processing plant  a fleet of mining equipment  ancillary facilities including an administration building  a warehouse  a maintenance shop  a stand by power generating facility and a residential site with associated facilities 
the new wassa processing plant was completed in early and placed in service on april  wassa s gold production and operating costs are shown on the gold production and unit costs table below 
st 
jude properties the st 
jude properties consist of the hwini butre and benso concessions containing undeveloped zones of gold mineralization and which together cover an area of square kilometers 
these two properties are located between and kilometers south of our wassa mine 
prior to being acquired by us  st 
jude conducted extensive exploration work at the st 
jude properties  and based on our review of this past work we estimated a measured and indicated gold resource of approximately million tonnes at an average grade of g t 
rosebel participation right through our owned subsidiary euro  we own a participation right referred to as the rosebel royalty 
this royalty is paid to our subsidiary by cambior inc  operator of the rosebel gold mine in suriname 
royalty income totaled million in and million in exploration assets we have interests in numerous gold exploration properties in ghana  sierra leone  burkina faso  niger  french guiana  suriname and in other areas of south america

the government of ghana  which has a carried interest in bogoso prestea and wassa  would receive of any dividends distributed from bogoso prestea and wassa once all of the capital has been repaid 
wassa s production figures are for the nine month period following its april  in service date 
mineral reserves our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in ni technical reports on our mineral reserves for bogoso prestea and wassa have been filed as required by ni the proven and probable mineral reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
we believe that our mineral reserves are calculated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable mineral reserves prescribed for use in the us by the us securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide see our glossary of terms 
we prepare our estimates of mineral reserves based on information compiled and or validated by mr 
william tanaka  our employee  who holds the position of group reserves manager 
mr 
tanaka is a qualified geological engineer with years of experience and is a member of the australian institute of mining and metallurgy 
mr 
tanaka is considered a qualified person under ni the proven and probable mineral reserves as of december  have been estimated at an economic cut off grade based on a gold price of per ounce  which approximately equates to the three year rolling average gold price 
this compares to per ounce used for the estimate of our mineral reserves at december  the cut off grade defines reserve material that is demonstrated to be technically and economically feasible to extract 
in determining reserves  we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs  including the costs to mine 
since all material lying within the optimized pit shell will be mined  the cut off grade used in determining our reserves is calculated on the basis of material that  having been mined  is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs ie mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage 
the qa qc controls program used in connection with the estimation of our reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance 
blanks are used to check for contamination 
standards are used to check for grade dependence biases 
a total of eleven standards are used  five generated by golden star ranging from to g t and six commercially available standards ranging from to g t

mineral reserves are expressed on a basis 
golden star s share of the mineral reserves is subject to the government of ghana s carried interest which entitles them to a dividend once our capital costs have been recovered 
stockpiled ores included in bogoso prestea s proven and probable mineral reserves at year end and are stockpiled ores of and million tonnes at an average grade of g t and g t  respectively

where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves 
for example  ni has a minimum requirement that reserves be supported by a pre feasibility study  whereas industry guide requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified

increases and decreases in mineral reserves can result from the discovery of new mineralization  conversion of non reserve mineral resources to mineral reserves  and changes in price assumptions  unit costs and recoveries or any combination of these factors 
the increases in mineral reserves during were due primarily to the results of exploration at bogoso prestea and wassa  and an increase to per ounce from per ounce in the estimated gold price used to calculate mineral reserves

table may not add due to rounding 
employees as of december   golden star  including our majority owned subsidiaries  had approximately  employees and contract employees  a increase from the approximately  people employed at the end of employees hired during at our new wassa operations made up most of the increase 
the total includes employees and one contract employee at our principal office in littleton  colorado  four employees and one contract employee in delta  british columbia and three people in south america 
customers currently all our gold production is sold to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a long term contract 
we receive payment for gold sold approximately five working days after the gold leaves the mine site 
we recognize revenue when title passes to the buyer which occurs upon delivery to the refinery  unless we decide to retain title and hold the gold as inventory 
during we sold all of the gold shipped  retaining no inventory of saleable dore bars 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice  therefore we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire and develop new and existing mineral properties 
factors that allow producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies  costs of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we compete with other mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new mineral properties 
many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are 
there is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  geologists  geophysicists and other technical personnel 
this could result in higher turnover and greater labor costs

item a 
risk factors risk factors you should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the information in this form k contains forward looking statements about our future business and performance 
our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this form k 
the risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance 
financial risks a substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be  significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues  profits and cash flows 
in particular  a sustained low gold price could o cause suspension of our mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa if such operations become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold price  thus further reducing revenues  o cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties  o cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations  o halt or delay the development of new projects  o reduce funds available for exploration  with the result that depleted reserves are not replaced  and o reduce or eliminate the benefit of enhanced growth opportunities anticipated from the st 
jude acquisition 
furthermore  the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or might interrupt operations until the reassessment can be completed 
mineral reserve calculations and life of mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we may incur substantial losses in the future that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult 
we had a net loss of million during the year ended december  and annual earnings of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we reported net losses of million in and million in numerous factors  including declining gold prices  lower than expected ore grades or higher than expected operating costs including increased commodity prices  and impairment write offs of mine property and or exploration property costs  could cause us to be unprofitable in the future 
the acquisition of st 
jude  which has no operating properties  may result in increased future losses 
any future operating losses could make financing our operations and our business strategy  including pursuit of the growth opportunities anticipated as a result of our acquisition of st 
jude  or raising additional capital  difficult or impossible and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of december  of million  including million payable to banks  million in equipment financing loans  million in senior convertible notes maturing on april   million of current trade payables  accrued current and other liabilities  million of future taxes  million of derivative liabilities and an million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities 
we expect that our indebtedness and other liabilities will increase as a result of our corporate development activities 
these liabilities could have important consequences  including the following o increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  o requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  o limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and o placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less relative to their market capitalization 
our estimates of mineral reserves could be inaccurate  which could cause production and costs to differ from estimates 
our estimates of non reserves mineral resources could also be inaccurate 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non reserve measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
these estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves may not be accurate  and mineral reserves and non reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing and production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only two major sources of operational cash flows  which will likely be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities 
while we have received significant infusions of cash from sales of equity and debt  our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from bogoso prestea and wassa 
the newly constructed wassa processing plant and open pit mine were completed and placed in service on april   and we currently process through the plant a mixture of ore from the open pit and materials from the prior owner s heap leach pads 
production at wassa was  ounces during the last nine months of and is expected to average approximately  to  ounces per year after however  wassa s production goal may not be achieved 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties will require significant expenditures over the next several years  which we expect to increase with the acquisition of st 
jude 
we expect that these expenditures will exceed free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea and wassa during and possibly in later years and therefore we expect in the future to require additional external debt or equity financing 
lower gold prices during the five years prior to adversely affected our ability to obtain financing  and recurring lower gold prices could have similar effects in the future 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  we might need to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties  and as a result  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
implementation of a gold hedging program might be unsuccessful and incur losses 
euro ressources sa  our owned subsidiary  has entered into a cash settled forward gold price agreement with its lender designed to reduce in part the impact of gold price fluctuations on expected future rosebel royalty revenues it receives from cambior inc  as required by its loan agreement 
while there is a risk of loss if the derivative positions were to be liquidated early and during a period of unfavorable gold prices  loan covenants prohibit liquidation of the position prior to the end of the loan repayment 
also  while the derivatives euro has entered into are economically effective  accounting for the derivatives on a mark to market basis could show large swings in any period as any unrealized  non cash losses gains are recognized through the statement of operations 
we have purchased and may continue to purchase put options puts and sell call options calls from time to time during the construction phase of the new processing plant at bogoso in ghana 
puts give us the right but not the obligation to sell gold in the future at a fixed price 
calls are contractual commitments which require us to sell gold at a fixed price on specified future dates 
if the spot market gold price exceeds the call option price on the specified sale date we would receive the call price rather than the higher spot market price for the gold ounces covered by the call option 
our call options are set at per ounce 
there will be no cost to us unless the spot market price of gold exceeds this level on the call options specified sales dates 
of our production  approximately is subject to calls at per ounce  and approximately is protected by puts at a floor price of per ounce 
we continue to review whether or not  in light of the potential for gold prices to fall  it would be appropriate to establish a more general hedging program 
to date  we have decided not to implement a more general hedging program on gold production from our own properties 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in united states dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in united states dollars or united states dollar denominated securities 
we typically convert our united states funds to foreign currencies as payment obligations become due 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and these foreign currencies  and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required to convert into cedis only of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government of ghana could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
in addition  we currently have future obligations that are payable in south african rand and euros  and receivables collectible in euros 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries 
the costs of goods and services could increase due to changes in the value of the united states dollar or the cedi  euros  the south african rand or other currencies  such as the recent cost increase due to the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies 
consequently  operation and development of our properties might be more costly than we anticipate 
we have purchased  and expect to continue to purchase south african rand and euro forward contracts to hedge the expected purchase of capital assets in south africa and europe in connection with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
we may engage in additional currency hedges in the future in connection with other projects 
implementation of a currency hedging program may not adequately protect us from the effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies  and we have recently completed the acquisition and joint venture of exploration and development properties in ghana and sierra leone and the acquisition of st 
jude on december  the search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive  divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful 
our success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with those of golden star 
any acquisition would be accompanied by risks 
for example  there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio  a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant 
we may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel 
the integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees  suppliers and contractors 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow 
we are subject to litigation risks all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
we are involved in various routine legal proceedings  which include labor matters such as unfair termination claims  supplier matters and property issues incidental to our business 
defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
operational risks the technology  capital costs and cost of production of refractory mineral reserves and non reserves at bogoso prestea remain subject to a number of uncertainties  including funding uncertainties 
based upon the completion of our bogoso sulfide project feasibility studies in and  the refractory material at bogoso prestea has been included in our proven and probable mineral reserves  which are prepared in accordance with ni of the canadian securities regulators 
while the sulfide project feasibility study indicated that refractory mineral reserves can be profitably mined and processed at current gold prices  the capital cost to construct a new bio oxidation or biox r plant at bogoso to process refractory ore  together with related mining equipment and facilities  is significant  and is forecast to be million  of which approximately million had been spent on the project through december  while the processing technology envisioned in the feasibility study has been successfully utilized at other mines  and despite our testing  engineering and analysis  the technology may not perform successfully at commercial production levels on the bogoso prestea refractory sulfide ores  in which case our production estimates may not be achieved 
the integration of golden star and st 
jude may not occur as planned 
we have only recently begun the process of integrating the operations of golden star and st 
jude 
the acquisition of st 
jude was proposed with the expectation that its successful completion would over time result in enhanced growth opportunities and the synergies resulting from the combination of increased earnings and reduced costs 
these anticipated benefits depend in part on whether the operations of golden star and st 
jude can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner and whether the st 
jude properties can be developed 
if these do not occur  the benefits we receive from the acquisition will be significantly less than anticipated 
most operational and certain staffing decisions with respect to the combined company have not yet been made 
these decisions and the integration of the two companies will present challenges to management  including the integration of systems and personnel of the two companies  and special risks  including possible unanticipated liabilities and costs 
we are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including o environmental hazards  o discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  o industrial accidents  o labor disputes and shortages  o supply and shipping problems and delays  o shortage of equipment and contractor availability  o difficulty in applying technology such as bio oxidation processing  o unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  o slope failures  o cave ins of underground workings  o failure of pit walls or dams  o fire  o marine and transit damage and or loss  o changes in the regulatory environment  and o natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we could incur liabilities as a result of pollution and other casualties 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations and permitting requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations and competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration or development of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a significant portion of our dunkwa property and portions of our wassa property  as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana  are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply 
mining and processing gold from the south end of the prestea property  the new tailings dam at bogoso and other activities will require mining and other permits from the government of ghana 
these permits may not be issued on a timely basis or at all  and such permits  when issued  may be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply 
such permitting issues could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates  production amounts and costs 
due to an increased level of non governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in ghana  the potential for the government of ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in ghana may be increased 
any changes in the government of ghana s policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations 
the exact nature of other environmental control problems  if any  which we may encounter in the future cannot be predicted  primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within various jurisdictions 
to the extent that we are subject to any such changes  they may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates  and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects 
mine development projects  including our recent development at wassa and expansion at bogoso prestea  and the potential development of any of the st 
jude properties if reserves are established  typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental assessments  issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as o estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  o anticipated metallurgical recovery rates  o environmental considerations and permitting  o future gold prices  and o anticipated capital and operating costs 
our mine development projects could have limited relevant operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs determined in feasibility studies are based on geologic and engineering analyses and might not prove to be accurate 
the management of mine development projects and start up of new operations are complex  and we do not have a history of simultaneously managing an ongoing operation  the start up of a new operation and a significant development project 
completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays  as occurred at wassa 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project o unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  o unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  o incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  o costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  o availability and cost of processing and refining facilities  o availability of economic sources of power  o adequacy of water supply  o adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  o unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses  o significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel  cyanide or other major components of operating costs  o government regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  as well as the costs of protection of the environment and agricultural lands  o fluctuations in gold prices  and o accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
because of these uncertainties  and others identified in these risk factors  our production estimates at bogoso prestea and wassa may not be achieved 
we need to continually discover  develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand our mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
at current average production rates  we estimate that bogoso prestea has about ten years of mine life and wassa has about five years of mine life  but our estimates might not be correct and the mine life would be shortened if we expand production 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration  including the exploration of the prestea underground and the st 
jude properties and other projects  involves a high degree of risk and exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored end up being ultimately developed into producing mines 
to the extent that we continue to be involved in gold exploration  the long term success of our operations will be related to the cost and success of our exploration programs 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is determined in part on the following factors o the identification of potential gold mineralization based on superficial analysis  o availability of prospective land  o availability of government granted exploration and exploitation permits  o the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and o the capital available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
as a result of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves and the development of mines 
we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing  precious metals 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
we seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
we have mining leases with respect to our bogoso prestea  wassa and prestea underground properties 
however  we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions could be severely constrained 
we generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage  and therefore  the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could adversely affect the exploration and development of our properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future operations 
we have obtained key person insurance only with respect to our president and chief executive officer 
the period of weak gold prices prior to resulted in depletion of the number of trained and experienced professionals and managers in our industry 
higher gold prices have resulted in an increased demand for these people  and it could therefore be more difficult to attract or retain such experienced professionals and managers without significantly increasing the cost to us 
our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including o adverse environmental conditions  o industrial accidents  o labor disputes  o unusual or unexpected geological conditions  o ground or slope failures  o cave ins  o changes in the regulatory environment  o marine transit and shipping damage and or losses  o natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes  and o political risks including expropriation and civil war 
such occurrences could result in o damage to mineral properties or production facilities  o personal injury or death  o loss of legitimate title to properties  o environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  o delays in mining  processing and development  o monetary losses  and o possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
in addition  as of the completion of the arrangement with st 
jude  our insurance policies do not cover st 
jude and its properties  and we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover st 
jude and its properties at economically feasible premiums or at all 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally african subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently  or to repay our convertible notes or other debt 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance 
our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including o licensing  o production  o taxes  o disposal of process water or waste rock  o toxic substances  o development and permitting  o exports  o imports  o labor standards  o occupational health and safety  o mine safety  and o environmental protections  compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following o planning  o designing  o drilling  o operating  o developing  o constructing  and o closure and reclamation 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation 
due to the substantial increase in mining development in ghana in recent years  the government of ghana has been reviewing the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees throughout the country and in some cases has requested higher levels of bonding than previously had been required 
our bonds may be increased 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us  cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
government regulations limit the proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana 
changes in regulations that increase these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea and wassa are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows 
the government of ghana has the right to increase its ownership and control of certain subsidiaries 
the government of ghana is entitled to a carried interest in gold properties in ghana 
the carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license 
as such  the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the bogoso prestea mine  the wassa mine and a carried interest in the prestea underground property in ghana 
the government of ghana also has a the right under the current mining law to acquire up to an additional equity interest in each of these subsidiaries for a price to be determined by agreement or arbitration although this right does not exist in the new minerals and mining bill which is expected to receive presidential assent in  b the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and c a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
the government of ghana may seek to exercise one or more of these rights  which could reduce our equity interest 
a reduction in our equity interest could reduce our income or cash flows from bogoso prestea or wassa  reducing amounts available to us for reinvestment and adversely affecting our ability to take certain actions 
we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in foreign countries 
certain laws  regulations and statutory provisions in certain countries in which we have mineral rights could  as they are currently written  have a material negative impact on our ability to develop or operate a commercial mine 
for countries where we have exploration or development stage projects  we intend to negotiate mineral agreements with the governments of these countries and seek variances or otherwise be exempted from the provisions of these laws  regulations and or statutory provisions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in obtaining mineral agreements or variances or exemptions on commercially acceptable terms 
in addition  our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties  including o the risks of war  civil unrest  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  o political instability and violence  o expropriation and nationalization  o renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  o illegal mining  o changes in taxation policies  o restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and o changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
illegal mining occurs on our properties  is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
we continue to experience significant illegal mining activity on our bogoso prestea property involving illegal miners numbering in the thousands 
most of this activity is close to our plant north pit and planned bogoso north and beta boundary pit areas and includes areas where we have established reserves 
it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this activity on our reserves and non reserve mineral resources 
the impact of this illegal mining  to the extent known at this time  on our currently reported mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources  has been reflected in our year end reserve figures 
while we are proactively working with local  regional and national governmental authorities to obtain protection of our property rights on a timelier basis  any action on the part of such authorities may not occur  may not fully address our problems or may be delayed 
in addition to the impact on our mineral reserve and non reserve mineral resources  the presence of illegal miners could lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
the work performed by the illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death for which we could potentially be held responsible 
illegal miners work on other of our properties from time to time  including on the paul isnard property in french guiana  and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties 
our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  united states  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act  failure in the future to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
we are required to annually test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditor addressing these assessments 
in connection with management s assessments for the year ended december   management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to not maintaining appropriate documentation to support the use of hedge accounting in our subsidiary  euro ressources sa we determined that golden star did not have the necessary controls in place to properly identify the lack of documentation  which was necessary to properly evaluate the derivative instruments to determine if hedge accounting was appropriate 
as a result of this  management has concluded that  for the year ended december   golden star did not maintain effective control over financial reporting 
as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of december  the treatment of the euro derivative contracts has been properly reflected in this annual report on form k  and we plan to restate our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended march  june and september  to reflect such change in accounting treatment 
we have taken steps to remediate the material weakness discussed above  however failure in the future to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
market risks the market price of our common shares could experience volatility and could decline significantly 
our common shares are listed on the american stock exchange amex and the toronto stock exchange tsx 
securities of small cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following o the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  o the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  o the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and o a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the amex and the tsx  further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management s attention and resources 
investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  certain of our directors and our experts 
golden star is a canadian corporation 
substantially all of our assets are located outside of canada and the united states  and our head office is located in the united states 
it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of canadian or us securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the united states upon our directors and experts 
execution by united states courts of any judgment obtained against us or  any of the directors  executive officers or experts named in this report in the united states courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons or corporations  as the case might be  in the united states 
the enforceability in canada of united states judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states is doubtful 
there may be certain tax risks associated with investments in golden star 
potential investors that are united states taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we currently are not a pfic and do not expect to become a pfic in the future  the tests for determining pfic status are dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we can not assure you that we would not become a pfic in the future 
if we were deemed to be a pfic  then a united states taxpayer who disposes of common shares at a gain  or who received a so called excess distribution on the common shares  generally would be required to treat such gain or excess distribution as ordinary income and pay an interest charge on a portion of the gain or distribution 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of march  approximately million common shares are issuable on exercise of warrants  options or other rights to purchase common shares including options and warrants issued in exchange for st 
jude options and warrants at prices ranging from cdn to cdn 
in addition  million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of our senior convertible notes issued in april during the life of the warrants  options  notes and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares  with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the warrants  options  notes and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights

accra  the capital city of ghana  is located on the prime meridian 
following a period as a british colony  ghana achieved independence in and it is now a republic with a democratically elected government 
ghana has a population of approximately million people 
english is the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the minister of mines through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and control the development of ghana s mineral wealth in accordance with the current mining law 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration concession granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for a period of two years subject to renewal 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineable mineral reserve  an application is made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area  normally for a period of to years 
production must typically begin within two years of the date of grant of a mining lease 
an amendment made to the current mining law in requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease by the government of ghana shall first give notice of such intention to the government and obtain its consent prior to acquiring such controlling share 
in accordance with the current mining law  the government of ghana is granted a carried interest in all companies such as bgl and wgl that hold mining leases 
the carried interest entitles the government of ghana to a pro rata share of future dividends none have been declared to date  if any  from bgl and wgl once all capital is repaid  and the government of ghana has no obligation to contribute development or operating expenses 
bgl and wgl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star or its subsidiaries as of december  for past advances  and these amounts would be repaid to us before payment of any dividends 
under the current mining law the government of ghana is entitled to acquire up to an additional interest in our operating companies 
if the government of ghana wished to exercise this right  it must first give reasonable notice  and pay a mutually agreed price 
under the new minerals and mining bill  which will become law when it receives presidential assent  expected later in  the government of ghana would no longer have the right to acquire this additional interest 
the government of ghana is also entitled to acquire a special or golden share in bgl or wgl or any mining company at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and bgl or wgl might agree 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government of ghana and bgl or wgl might agree 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights o the special share would carry no voting rights  but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  o the special share could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government or a person acting on behalf of the government  o the written consent of the holder of the special share would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  and o the holder of the special share would be entitled to the payment of a nominal sum of  ghanaian cedis in a winding up or liquidation of the company in priority to any payment to other members and could require the company to redeem the special share at any time for a nominal sum of  cedis 
bgl and wgl have not issued nor to date been requested to issue any such special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by bgl and wgl 
the purchase price would be agreed by the government of ghana and bgl and wgl  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between bgl or wgl and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as bgl and wgl sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the bank of ghana 
the existing legal structure for mining in ghana has been under review with the intent to make it more competitive and bring it in line with international best practice 
to this end the new minerals and mining bill was placed before the ghanaian parliament in late after being subjected to public critique by various stakeholders  a revised bill was considered by the ghanaian parliament and passed in late december the new law will come into force when it has been given presidential assent and gazette notification as required by the ghana constitution 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that the implementation of the new bill will have a material impact on our operations in ghana 
ghanaian royalty requirements under the laws of ghana  a holder of a mining lease is required to pay quarterly a royalty of not less than per annum and not more than per annum of the total revenues earned from the lease area 
under the new minerals and mining bill  the upper limit on the royalty would be capped at 
the government of ghana determines the royalty percentage each year based on the ratio that the operating margin bears to the value of gold produced from a mining lease in that year 
based on the mineral royalty regulation of  the royalty is when the operating ratio is or less  the royalty increases for each increase in operating ratio until the royalty reaches a maximum of see above at an operating ratio of 
in  and the royalty rate for bgl was of revenues and bgl paid million  million and million  respectively 
the royalty payments from bgl have not exceeded per annum in any year 
wgl also paid a royalty in or million 
ghanaian environmental regulations all environmental matters in ghana  including those related to mining  fall under the oversight of the ghana environmental protection agency epa 
the epa has formulated rules and guidelines which govern environmental impact statements  mine operations  and mine closure and reclamation  to which our operations are subject 
in conformance with epa requirements  we posted reclamation bonds for the wassa and bogoso prestea properties in we bonded million to cover future reclamation obligations at wassa comprised of a million letter of credit and cash deposit of million 
we also bonded million for bogoso prestea comprised of an million letter of credit and million of cash 
signed bonding agreements are now in place for both wassa and bogoso prestea 
bgl completed significant work during to identify the outstanding reclamation liabilities for bogoso prestea and to prepare a rehabilitation work plan 
significant work has been performed since that time to advance this plan and to reduce the outstanding historic reclamation liability 
expenditures for ongoing rehabilitation work  including the capping of sulfide material  back filling of worked out pits  and the contouring and re vegetation of waste dumps  were approximately million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in addition to the bonds detailed above  as at december   bgl still had million of restricted cash set aside for environmental reclamation of the bogoso mine since when we purchased bogoso from the international finance corporation and a consortium of banks 
the plant north pit at prestea has been developed in stages with the development of the final stage phase commencing in august initiation of phase mining was conditional on a number of mitigation measures identified in our environmental impact statement 
the epa requested suspension of mining of the plant north phase pit on september  and of the plant north pit on september  until certain outstanding mitigation measures were completed 
the mitigation measures were completed and inspected by the epa on october  on november   we received approval from the epa to recommence mining operations at the plant north pit and mining activity was recommenced a few days later following a series of informational meetings with the prestea community 
during the mining suspension at plant north  processing operations continued at the bogoso processing plant using stockpiled ore 
mining and processing operations at the wassa mine and construction activities on the bogoso sulfide expansion project also continued without interruption 
to our knowledge  all our operations in ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 
community development programs and sustainability it is our policy and our intent to be a responsible corporate citizen of ghana and in all other areas where we conduct our business 
we believe our success as an employer  as a citizen of the local community and as a participant in the local economy is dependent on achieving and maintaining good community relationships 
as such  we strive to accommodate and support local efforts to improve the economic and overall well being of the communities around our operations 
alternative livelihood and sustainable development program alsd in mid we initiated the alsd program in the bogoso prestea area and expanded the program during to include wassa 
the goals of the alsd program are to assist the communities in the vicinity of our mining operations to create alternative employment opportunities  promote growth of sustainable economic development and to reduce the community s dependence on mining 
given the importance of agriculture in the local economy  much of our efforts have been focused on agricultural opportunities 
palm oil palm oil is a major cash crop for many farmers in southern ghana and based on the historical success of ghana s palm oil industry  we believe palm oil farming has the potential to make a significant contribution to the local community s economic development 
palm oil production requires land 
historically the economic base of many of the communities surrounding our operations has been based on mine employment 
as a result many of the residents have not acquired land and have thus been excluded from farming in general and the palm oil business specifically 
in the past three years we have assisted and trained in excess of local residents to establish palm oil plantations on approximately  acres of reclaimed waste rock dumps and other areas around our mines 
in we plan to initiate a new four year program to significantly expand on the success of our initial palm oil program 
to this end we have procured about  acres of additional land holding and aim to increase this to  acres of additional land in the land will be used to expand the palm oil cooperative program providing employment and eventual land ownership to as many as  local residents 
we are also negotiating with a business partner in the palm oil business who will assist by providing a processing facility and a market for the oil 
these plantations should fully mature in about three years with an expected yield of about  metric tonnes of fresh fruit bunch annually 
fish farm we have established a fish farm in one of the completed pits at bogoso 
the fish have done well and we now estimate there are approximately tonnes of fish ready for harvesting 
we hope that the success of this project will encourage development of private fish farms in the local communities 
sericulture we have established a mulberry plantation and silk worm rearing facility at bogoso 
thirty local farmers are now participating in this project and have to date produced kilograms of silk cocoons 
poultry our demonstration farm is also training and assisting local farmers with poultry production 
a ban on importation of poultry products from several countries due to bird flu concerns has created this opportunity for local farmers 
the program has implemented poultry projects with  chicks in ten communities 
the poultry project will focus on egg production 
other projects other projects we are supporting or plan to support in include snail farming  mushrooms  citrus production and vocational training 
in collaboration with government agencies  the ghana department of cooperatives is assisting us in developing the project beneficiary groups into commodity based associations including the oil palm farmers association  poultry farmers association and sericulture farmers association and four ministry of agriculture staff are providing technical support to the beneficiary farmers in the areas surrounding our operations 
other contacts have been made with local and international non governmental organizations in developing micro credit schemes on behalf of the company 
community assistance programs in addition to the alternative livelihood projects described above  we are involved in the ongoing funding of several community assistance projects 
over the past few years we have provided funding and assistance for school improvements and equipment  libraries  day care centers  community centers  potable water systems and wells  sports facilities  toilet facilities  electrification projects  health facilities  road improvements and hospital equipment 
at our corporate headquarters in denver  colorado the employees and their family members initiated a book donation program in late seeking to obtain  books which will be used to stock libraries in the communities around our operations 
to date approximately  volumes have been donated  sorted and packed for shipment 
local high school student volunteers have done most of the sorting and packing 
the books acquired to date include a wide assortment of topics including primary and secondary school texts  children s books  novels  reference  travel and general interest books 
endowment fund in late  we established two endowment funds in ghana  one at wassa and one at bogoso 
the purposes of the endowment funds are to promote and facilitate sustainable socio economic development and to improve the quality of life in the communities surrounding our operations and in we will transition to channeling all of our community assistance programs through these funds 
the funds will provide funding for development projects and charitable causes 
the fund will receive periodic cash contributions from bgl and wgl based on gold production and net income 
operating properties the bogoso prestea gold mine overview of the bogoso prestea operation bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa 
it can be reached by paved roads from tarkwa and from accra  the capital of ghana 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately kilometers of strike of the southwest trending ashanti gold district 
the mining areas at prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plant by approximately kilometers of paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
equipment and facilities at bogoso prestea include several open pit mines  a nominal  tonne per day cil gold processing plant and a fleet of haul trucks  loaders and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities such as power and water supply equipment  haul roads  housing for management and technical staff  a medical clinic  tailings storage facility  waste dumps  warehouse  maintenance shops  offices and administrative facilities 
the bogoso prestea properties and mining rights are granted under four mining leases  which expire on or after august commercial mining at bogoso dates back to the early years of the th century 
during its year period of operations from to  production totaled over  ounces of gold at an average recovered grade of g t 
from to  the current prestea property was comprised of a number of different licenses operated by independent mining companies  which in were amalgamated by the government of ghana into prestea goldfields limited  under the aegis of the state gold mining corporation 
total gold production from the prestea area since recorded mining commenced in the s is reported by the ghana mineral commission to be in excess of nine million ounces  making it the second largest historical gold producing area in ghana  after the obuasi mine 
we acquired bogoso in late and all of our production came from reserves located on the bogoso concession until october when we commenced surface mining on the adjoining prestea concession 
the prestea concession was acquired in mid from through we have produced  ounces of gold from bogoso prestea 
operating results for bogoso prestea the following table displays historical operating results at bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea operating results ore milled t    rate t day    grade milled g t recovery total gold production oz    cash operating cost oz total cash cost oz gold production is shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines 
bogoso prestea expansion project gold ore reserves in general and specifically at bogoso prestea can be segregated into two general ore types referred to as refractory and non refractory 
refractory ores typically contain un oxidized sulfide minerals with the gold trapped within the sulfide minerals 
such ores are also commonly referred to as sulfide ores and they cannot be economically processed in conventional cil circuits such as our existing bogoso processing plant 
non refractory ores typically contain no sulfides or the sulfide minerals have been naturally oxidized 
there are also certain sulfide ores that are non refractory if the gold exists on surface of the sulfide minerals rather than embedded within the sulfide minerals 
ores that have been naturally oxidized are referred to as oxide ores 
non refractory ores  including oxide ores  can be efficiently processed through the existing bogoso cil processing plant 
since of the remaining ore reserves at bogoso prestea are refractory and cannot be processed by our existing plant  a decision was made in june to construct a new million tonne per annum processing facility at bogoso  located next to the existing non refractory processing plant  which will utilize a proprietary biox r bio oxidation technology to treat the refractory sulfide ore 
when completed in late  the new sulfide plant together with the existing cil plant  are expected to be able to process a combined million tonnes per year of ore 
completion on schedule and anticipated production levels for the new facility are subject to a number of risks  including the issuance in a timely manner of all necessary development and operating permits 
the existing cil processing plant will retain its current configuration and will continue to process non refractory ores during the construction phase of the new biox r plant 
after the new biox r plant comes on line  it is anticipated that the existing bogoso cil processing plant will process mostly oxide ores and the biox r plant will process mostly refractory sulfide ores and mixed oxide refractory ores 
the two plants sitting side by side are expected to provide operational efficiencies since they will share management  labor  reagents  warehouse parts and maintenance efforts 
and with the two plants and their differing technologies  we should be able to effectively process all of the ore types known to exist in the bogoso prestea area 
construction work on the biox r plant is proceeding within schedule and budget 
ordering of long lead time items is substantially complete as is the detailed engineering design 
concrete work is well progressed for all of the equipment 
the stainless steel biox r reactor tanks have been erected and structural steel erection has commenced 
erection of the cil tanks is also nearing completion which will allow structural steel erection to also commence in this area 
the electrical contractor has mobilized and has commenced work 
the crusher and new sag mill were shipped to ghana in march and the ball mill is already on site and mounted on its pedestal 
the design and construction of the expansion project is being managed by grd minproc on an engineering  procurement and construction management basis 
work has proceeded under a letter of agreement entered into in february and a definitive contract is expected to be finalized shortly 
pre stripping of two sulfide pits in readiness for the commissioning of the biox r plant has already commenced and will be accelerated when additional trucks are delivered  commencing in april the non refractory plant will continue to process non refractory ores from the plant north pit at prestea until completion of mining in the fourth quarter of afterward we plan to feed the non refractory plant with oxide ores from pampe  mampon and various areas on the south end of the prestea property 
we estimate that the total capital cost of the new sulfide plant project  including the expansion of the mining fleet  to be approximately million  and we expect a to month construction period  ending in late at the end of  approximately million of the total had been spent 
in  following the completion of the biox r plant  we expect the combined gold production from the two bogoso plants to be approximately  ounces per annum at an average cash operating cost of per ounce 
based on our test work  we expect gold recoveries from the biox r process to average and vary between and 
geology at bogoso prestea the bogoso prestea property lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield along a kilometer stretch of the ashanti trend located immediately south of the town of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts the prestea  bogoso  obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is about kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region  and gradually converges with it  converging at obuasi and forming the basis for the obuasi deposit  owned and operated by anglogold ashanti limited 
mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources at bogoso prestea bogoso prestea has proven and probable mineral reserves  excluding the mineral reserves at mampon discussed below  of million tonnes at a grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
total measured and indicated mineral resources  excluding those mineral resources at mampon and pampe discussed below  total million tonnes with a grade of g t before a reduction for the minority interest 
assuming no new reserves are discovered  the current proven and probable mineral reserves should support mining operations for approximately seven years  although we expect the mine life to be extended as we continue to evaluate mineral resources through ongoing exploration efforts 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
exploration at bogoso prestea exploration activities on the bogoso property in focused on defining and expanding the sulfide reserves in advance of initiation of a sulfide ore pre strip program in early the drilling also focused on requirements to finalize pit designs at chujah and buesichem 
these two pits are scheduled to provide sulfide feed to the new sulfide plant in  and into in addition  drilling at other areas at bogoso was conducted to understand and expand the sulfide reserves beneath several of the other old oxide pits 
a total of million was spent on exploration at bogoso in surface exploration drilling on the prestea property during was limited to the evaluation of shallow underground targets in the plant north pit vicinity 
while results in areas drilled during were not encouraging  other zones directly beneath the plant north pit will be tested in a bogoso prestea regional geologic mapping program initiated in continued during the program will cover approximately square kilometers around the bogoso and prestea properties when completed in early the mampon project the mampon deposit  which is located within the dunkwa properties  is approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plant 
it was acquired in  as part of the dunkwa property acquisition 
an analysis of the drilling and other geologic data provided by the former owner as well as our own drilling in and has established a probable reserve of approximately million tonnes grading grams per tonne or approximately  ounces of gold which is accessible by open pit mining methods 
the geology of the mampon deposit is similar to the geology at bogoso prestea 
our current plan is to haul the mampon ore by truck to the bogoso processing plant to supplement ores from the bogoso prestea deposits 
our current long term plan calls for mining mampon in and mampon ore is approximately refractory and non refractory 
the pampe project the pampe deposit is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plant on the akropong trend 
while we have owned the rights to pampe for several years  drilling during identified a measured and indicated resource of million tonnes at an average grade of g t most of which is either oxide ore or non refractory sulfide ore and most of which should be recoverable by open pit mining methods 
permitting for this project is now underway and haul road construction is scheduled for we expect to commence mining at pampe before the end of bondaye tuapim area due to the presence of illegal miners no work was carried out on the south end of the prestea property during once the illegal miner situation is resolved  we anticipate additional exploration work in these areas with the ultimate goal of mining oxide ores for the bogoso oxide plant after we also expect to further investigate initially the shallow and ultimately the deeper underground potential of this area 
the wassa gold mine overview of the wassa gold mine the wassa gold mine located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea  was initially developed in the late s by a consortium of european mining companies and consisted of an open pit mine  a crusher and a conventional heap leach operation 
while operating as a heap leach property  wassa produced approximately  ounces of gold per annum for a period of just over two years beginning in and ending in mid when mining operations were suspended 
in september wgl  our owned subsidiary  acquired the inactive wassa gold property located kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
as with bogoso prestea  the government of ghana holds a carried interest which entitles it to of any future dividends none have been declared to date 
dividend payments will not be made until wgl has repaid all contributed capital and shareholder advances to golden star 
in late  following completion of a feasibility study we initiated construction of a nominal million tonnes per year  tonne per day cil processing plant at wassa 
the construction phase ended in early  and the wassa open pit mine and plant was placed in service on april  in the nine months ended december   wassa processed million tonnes of ore at an average grade of grams per tonne and shipped  ounces of gold at an average total cash cost per ounce of plant feed is a mixture of newly mined ore from the wassa pit blended with material from the heap leach pads left by the prior owners 
during  we expect to produce approximately  ounces of gold at wassa at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
we expect production to increase and unit costs to decline later in and beyond as we expose higher grade ores at deeper levels in the pit and also resolve certain plant design issues which have limited plant through put to less than design capacity since its in service date 
in  we expect annual gold production of approximately  ounces per year  at an average cash operating cost of around per ounce 
the reserves at wassa at the end of should be sufficient to support operations to early geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into metasedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
wassa is situated on the southeastern limb of the tarkwa syncline while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern limb 
the northwestern belt hosts the obuasi  prestea  and bogoso gold mines but the southeastern limb also is characterized by gold mines and mineral occurrences 
tarkwaian hosted deposits along the southeastern limb include goldfield s tarkwa and abosso mines  while birimian hosted gold occurrences include our hwini butre concession and wassa 
mineral reserves and mineral resources at wassa at december   wassa has a probable mineral reserve of million tonnes with an average grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
total indicated mineral resources consist of million tonnes with a grade of approximately g t before any reduction for the minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this k 
exploration at wassa exploration activities at wassa during concentrated on rc drilling of two parallel geochemical anomalies identified in which extend southwest approximately kilometers from the main pit area 
other than one narrow zone that typically carried to grams per tonne  results were not encouraging 
various other geochemical anomalies were also tested at wassa by rab drilling during and while most of these projects are at a very preliminary stage  results were encouraging with several intercepts at various places on the property exceeding minimum ore grades 
work continued on the south akyempim zone discovered in we have now identified approximately million tonnes of near surface ore at an average grade of grams per tonne in this area and we have initiated the process to acquire mining permits to allow mining of this deposit in the second half of exploration stage properties in ghana prestea underground overview the prestea underground is an inactive underground gold operation located directly beneath our prestea property consisting of two operating shafts and extensive underground workings and support facilities 
support facilities include an administrative office  maintenance shops  a warehouse and electrical substations 
access to the mine site is via a paved road from tarkwa and accra maintained by the government of ghana 
any potential future production from the prestea underground would most likely be trucked to the bogoso processing plant for processing 
the prestea underground has produced approximately nine million ounces of gold  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of approximately ten kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two shafts  one near the town of prestea and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest 
underground operations ceased in early  following an extended period of low gold prices 
in march  our subsidiary bgl entered into a joint venture agreement with the former owners to further explore and evaluate the remaining potential of the underground operations 
in late  our partner in the prestea underground joint venture filed for bankruptcy in ghana 
our partner s position  under the provisions of the joint venture agreement has now reverted to a net profits interest  which is currently controlled by the former partner s bankruptcy trustee 
since there is currently no production from the prestea underground mine there is no net profit to share with our bankrupt partner 
bgl now holds a ownership in the prestea underground 
the government of ghana continues to hold a ownership in prestea underground as well as its holding in bgl  resulting in an beneficial ownership by golden star 
geology of prestea underground the prestea deposits are found along the ashanti trend which extends over kilometers and which accounts for to of the total quartz lode hosted gold extracted in ghana 
other mines located along the same shear are our bogoso pits and the obuasi and konongo mines owned by others 
two types of gold hosts have historically been recognized at prestea fault related hydrothermal quartz veins  and disseminated sulfide hosted gold mineralization associated with metavolcanic pods 
the first type of ore was the focus of intense mining during prestea s past production 
we intend to evaluate both types of mineralization 
mineral resources at prestea underground as of december  we have identified total non reserve inferred mineral resources at the prestea underground of million tonnes at an average grade of g t before any reduction for the minority interest 
exploration activities at prestea underground a total of  meters of underground exploration drilling was completed at the prestea underground during the drilling focused on testing extensions of the high grade west reef shoot between levels a depth of between and meters and also prospective zones of remnant mineralization lying below and to the south of the plant north pit which could be exploited via a decline at the base of the pit 
results from both these areas have been encouraging with drilling to continue in a deep surface hole at bondaye was initiated during to test the down plunge extension of high grade mineralization to approximately meters below the extent of current historical workings 
although technical problems and delays were seen in  the drilling was completed mid for a total of  meters including a parent hole to  meters and a wedged daughter hole to  meters 
only spotty  discontinuous gold mineralization was encountered in the reef zone at both the parent and daughter hole 
however this may simply reflect the typical pinch and swell character of the prestea reef system and cannot be considered a definitive test of the bondaye plunge potential 
total spending on long term assets at prestea underground totaled million in  up from million during spending in included million on underground drilling and other geological activities  million on feasibility work  million on dewatering  security and site maintenance  and million on equipment purchases 
support crews continue to maintain the underground and surface facilities in good working order and assist the underground drilling teams 
by the end of  dewatering efforts had cleared the lowest sections of the old underground workings and an extensive underground drilling program has been initiated which will continue during most of to test areas immediately below the deepest old workings 
we believe these deeper levels provide the best opportunities for significant new discoveries in the prestea underground 
we intend to complete an initial feasibility study by the end of evaluating the economic potential of restarting production from the prestea underground mine 
st 
jude properties the st 
jude properties were acquired in late december as part of the st 
jude acquisition 
these properties consist of the hwini butre and benso gold concessions prospecting licenses at the southeastern end of the ashanti gold belt region in ghana 
while we now hold a interest in these properties through our subsidiaries  the government of ghana will become entitled to a carried interest at the time mining permits are granted 
the hwini butre concession is located approximately kilometers south of wassa and occupies an area of approximately square kilometers 
st 
jude and its predecessors have previously carried out numerous exploration programs on the concessions and identified two significant zones of gold mineralization 
the st 
jude properties also include the benso concession  located in the tarkwa district  directly north of the hwini butre concession and about kilometers south of wassa 
the benso concession covers an area of approximately square kilometers  and consists of three blocks the amantin  subriso  and chichiwelli blocks 
st 
jude and its predecessors previously conducted a geochemical soil sampling survey over the benso concession and drill programs on the three blocks 
we commenced our own exploration activities on the st 
jude properties in early  and have budgeted approximately million for the program in the hwini butre and benso concessions lie along the southeastern flank of the birimian aged lower proterozoic ashanti belt  along the same structural trend as wassa 
the southwestern part of the hwini butre concession covers the mpohor complex  a syn volcanic mafic intrusive that is bound to the east and north by the butre volcanic sequence 
the mpohor complex is a polyphase intrusion with compositions ranging from gabbroic to granophyric  with intermediate phases such as diorite and granodiorite 
the butre volcanic sequence  which also underlies the benso concession further north  mostly comprises volcanic flows with minor metasediment horizons 
the main regional structural orientation trends northeasterly but extensive north to northwest trending cross cutting fracture systems are also well developed 
the latter host much of the mineralization in the district  with vein systems at dabokrom  father brown  adoikrom  the subriso zones and amantin located within or marginal to the mpohor complex 
mineralization on the hwini butre concession is typically associated with shallowly east dipping narrow quartz veins and their associated sericitic alteration halos  with coarse free gold associated with sulfides and as specks within the quartz veins and altered host rocks 
in contrast  mineralization at subriso west and central subriso forms a series of relatively steep dipping  north trending zones characterized by strong shearing and pervasive silica replacement with local silica flooding and only minor thin quartz veining 
studies will be carried out during to determine if ore from the st 
jude properties should be hauled to the wassa plant for processing or if a stand alone processing plant should be built in the general vicinity of the st 
jude properties 
akropong trend properties during  we continued working on the akropong trend properties located approximately to kilometers to the west of bogoso prestea 
the objective of this work was to identify additional mineral reserve opportunities in the immediate vicinity of bogoso prestea that could  in the future  provide additional sources of processing plant feed for the bogoso processing plants 
as explained above  drilling at the pampe property established a measured and indicated resource at pampe during the other akropong trend projects are still at an early stage of exploration and to date they do not have  and ultimately might not have  proven and probable mineral reserves 
we spent approximately million on akropong projects during compared to million in most of the akropong spending was related to rab and rc drilling at the pampe property 
dunkwa properties including mampon overview of the dunkwa properties in  we purchased two prospecting licenses  asikuma and mansiso  along the ashanti trend from birim goldfields inc  which we refer to as the dunkwa properties 
these properties cover kilometers of strike along the ashanti trend directly north of and contiguous with the current bogoso concession 
they are accessible by ghanaian public roads 
the addition of the asikuma and mansiso prospecting licenses  which cover and square kilometers  respectively  increases our property holdings along the trend to over kilometers in length 
in  we also acquired from ashanti goldfields company limited the rights to the mampon prospect located on the asikuma license 
ore from mampon is expected to be trucked to the bogoso processing plant commencing in the mampon prospect was discovered in using regional geochemical methods and consists of narrow quartz veins with strong pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization in the wall rocks ranging up to total sulfides 
these prospects are also associated with shearing and or graphitic faults  similar to those seen at bogoso 
there are five known gold prospects on the dunkwa concession 
all of these occur in the same approximate stratigraphic position within lower birimian sediments from to kilometers west of the contact with the birimian metavolcanics 
exploration activities at the dunkwa properties most of the work on the dunkwa properties during was focused on the mampon area where data was gathered to assist in pit design for surface mining now scheduled for late late in we began a drilling program on an unexplored nine kilometer section of the property covered by opon river valley sediments which coincides with a conductivity anomaly 
spending in the dunkwa area totaled million in regional activities in ghana in  we continued with several early stage regional projects in southern ghana by conducting geochemical surveys over extensive areas to the east and south of the bogoso prestea and wassa areas extending east to within kilometers of accra see map at the beginning of item description of properties 
this work has identified gold anomalies which will be followed up with additional sampling in we applied for and received prospecting licenses on these properties  referred to as breman asikuma and takoradi north 
other exploration stage properties in africa mano river joint venture  sierra leone in late we entered into a joint venture agreement with mano river resources inc  which holds seven gold properties in sierra leone totaling approximately square kilometers 
a diamond core drilling program commenced in mid march at the yirisen prospect on the north pampana license  and holes were completed 
grades and gold mineralization proved to be variable and discontinuous 
however  due to the prospective nature of the local area  as evidenced by numerous artisanal workings and favorable geology  a reconnaissance soil sampling program was initiated over all the joint venture properties in late which continued into final assay results were received near the end of the third quarter and showed anomalies worthy of follow up on the pampana and sonfon projects 
in the meantime  it has been agreed with our joint venture partner  mano river resources inc  that the earn in period will be extended by months 
a minimum of  is budgeted for exploration on this project in moto goldmines investment moto goldmines limited moto is a canadian listed gold exploration company which focuses its activities in the democratic republic of the congo in central africa 
at the end of we owned approximately or five million of moto s outstanding common shares plus warrants to acquire a further one million shares before june at an exercise price of australian per share 
our vice president of exploration serves on moto s board of directors 
in march  we exercised the remaining warrants  at a cost of million  bringing our total ownership to six million shares and immediately afterward sold all the shares in a bought deal transaction in canada for cdn per share for net proceeds to golden star of cdn million million 
afema  cote d ivoire in march  we entered into an option to purchase the afema project in cote d ivoire from the ivorian parastatal company societe d etat pour le developpement minier de la cote d ivoire so 
de 
mi 
the afema property covers an area of  square kilometers of prospective birimian rocks in south east cote d ivoire which represent the southeastern extension of the sefwi belt meta volcanics and the kumasi basin meta sedimentary rocks 
in ghana this belt basin contact hosts the multi million ounce chirano and bibiani gold deposits 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we made an immediate payment of million to so 
de 
mi 
which gave us the right to carry out a six month detailed technical due diligence  after which we will have the right to complete the transaction to acquire of so 
de 
mi 
s rights in the afema property for million subject to a statutory interest by the government of cote d ivoire 
if we proceed with the acquisition  in addition to the acquisition payments  golden star will pay to so 
de 
mi 
a royalty on future gold production from the afema property indexed to the gold price 
at current gold prices in the range of per ounce the royalty rate would be 
golden star undertook an intensive exploration program at afema during the six months following signing of the option  including the collection and analysis of over  soil samples and compilation and assessment of previous exploration data 
despite this work  we were unable to come to a definitive decision on the merits of the project and hence a six month extension to the option period was requested  which so 
de 
mi 
has granted 
we plan to use the extension to continue the assessment of previous data and to complete infill sampling and trenching of some of the better anomalies defined by the initial program 
approximately million was spent on this project in  and a further million including the option exercise payment is budgeted for goulagou  burkina faso we hold an beneficial interest in the goulagou and adjoining rounga gold properties  which were acquired as part of the st 
jude acquisition in late together the two contiguous properties cover approximately square kilometers and are located approximately kilometers west of ouagadougou  the capital city of burkina faso  and kilometers north of the city of ouahigouya 
drilling program carried out by st 
jude and their predecessors identified several areas of gold enrichment including two parallel gold mineralized zones on the goulagou property 
deba and tialkam projects  niger the deba and tialkam properties are gold exploration properties in niger acquired as part of the st 
jude acquisition in late through our subsidiary  st 
jude  we hold a interest in the two exploration permits  subject to the interest of the government of niger 
st 
jude obtained certain data from exploration carried out by previous owners and initiated a new drilling program in late the first phase results of the drilling program are being evaluated 
mininko  mali in early  a review of drill results at mininko indicated a limited potential for this project 
we withdrew from the joint venture in the first quarter of and wrote off all of the million of costs incurred in the project 
exploration stage properties in south america saramacca property the saramacca project is located in suriname and is owned by golden star 
two successive soil auger sampling programs completed in evaluated a series of stream sediment gold anomalies and defined a kilometer long soil anomaly forming a series of en echelon zones 
deep augering in further confirmed the anomaly now termed anomaly m 
shallow diamond core drilling comprising holes for a total of  meters commenced at anomaly m in march this work was undertaken with a lightweight man portable drill rig due to the rugged terrain  limiting hole depths to less than meters 
mineralization intersected within drill cores consisted of variably sheared silicified pyritic metasediments of tuffaceous origin and volcanic conglomerates  often with little or no quartz veining 
significant gold assays were also intersected within the upper to meters of enriched lateritic duricrust and mottled saprolite 
based on the encouraging results from the work  we plan to follow up with a second phase of deeper core drilling and a program of mechanized trenching in an attempt to elucidate the structure of the host rocks beneath the duricrust capping 
a budget of million has been earmarked for this work in  but we are also investigating joint venture possibilities for the property 
bon espoir property the bon espoir property is located in french guiana and is owned by golden star 
it covers a sheared belt basin volcanic sediment contact zone analogous to those we are exploring in similar aged lower proterozoic terrains in ghana 
during  we conducted a regional soil sampling along much of the kilometer long sediment volcanic contact shear zone that hosts the wayamaga prospect drilled by previous owners of the bon espoir permit 
this soil sampling program was completed during july  with some kilometers of baseline and kilometers of cross lines cut  and soil sampling completed on cross lines spaced meters apart on meter centers 
as expected  the assay results identified coherent zones of anomalous low grade zones of gold and arsenic along the main wayamaga structural break  however the tenor of the anomalism was not strong enough to warrant immediate follow up 
it is planned to reduce the bon espoir permit area to cover the best of these anomalies while regional extensions of the wayamaga structure are investigated 
paul isnard the paul isnard project is located in the western part of french guiana  some km west of cayenne 
the project covers rocks of the lower proterozoic paramacca formation which contain gold mineralization in the form of pyritic disseminated zones or stringer zones and sulfide rich shear zones  which can be reasonably correlated between the current widely spaced meter drill sections 
an inferred mineral resource of million tonnes grading g t has been identified at montagne d or on the southern boundary of the paul isnard concession 
further work is warranted to identify additional sources of hard rock mineralization  which together with the mineral resource at montagne d or could support a future mining operation 
in  we reviewed the historical work on the property and as a result in early reduced the area of the permit to km covering only the most prospective areas 
benzdorp the km benzdorp south gold project is located along the eastern border of suriname  approximately km southeast of paramaribo 
the benzdorp mining district is underlain by the lower proterozoic paramacca greenstone and a felsic intrusive assemblage 
recorded and estimated alluvial gold production from historical dredging and present day small scale alluvial mining is in excess of  ounces 
exploration to date by golden star has identified several zones of bedrock mineralization but none of these are regarded as being economically viable at current gold prices 
in early a third party was conducting due diligence on the property as a prelude to acquiring it from golden star 
minera irl minera irl is a private  junior exploration company active in peru and chile in which we hold an approximate interest through our shareholding in goldmin consolidated holdings 
minera irl has developed a portfolio of exploration projects  the most advanced of which  corihuarmi in peru  was drilled in with encouraging results 
corihuarmi  located km east of lima near huancayo  consists of an extensive high sulfidation epithermal system with gold mineralization hosted in massive vuggy silica and alunite zones 
the focus of minera irl s exploration has been two massive siliceous outcrops known as susan and diana  which crop out boldly above the surrounding softer argillically altered volcanic rocks 
it is thought that the better grade oxide gold mineralization at susan and diana is structurally controlled within silicified crackle breccia zones where they are cut by feeder structures 
several similar zones have been identified and additional drilling was completed in to expand the size of the current gold resource in readiness for a full feasibility study in other earlier stage projects being investigated by minera irl include frontera  located in northern chile  km northeast from the seaport of arica  and just across the peruvian border from minsur s checocollo project  which has been intensively drilled over the last months  cushuro in the la libertad district of northern peru  and the chama prospect near abancay 
minera irl is actively assessing other properties throughout the andean cordillera 
other areas in addition to the project work discussed above we have undertaken several regional reconnaissance initiatives using both our own staff and contract geologists in ghana  cote d ivoire  mauritania  brazil  argentina and bolivia  spending approximately million in for such activities 
we have also held discussions with other companies to identify opportunities for joint venture exploration efforts in several areas  including the guiana shield 
item legal proceedings prestea gold resources limited pgr  our joint venture partner in the prestea underground  entered receivership in march the joint venture agreement between bgl and pgr specified that if either party to the joint venture were to go into receivership any remaining interest held in the partnership by the insolvent partner would immediately vest with the solvent partner 
while pgr s official liquidator affirmed that the vesting of this interest in bgl was proper under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the transfer and vesting of pgr s ownership was challenged in an action brought before the high court in accra  ghana against the official liquidator by merchant bank ghana ltd  in its capacity as a judgment creditor of pgr 
the action was commenced on february  and sought an order of the court to compel the official liquidator to take control of pgr s residual interest in the joint venture and to have the interest valued with the ultimate goal of making proceeds available for distribution among all the creditors of pgr 
the judgment creditor s claim was based on the assertion that the vesting of the residual interest in bgl under the joint venture agreement was either illegal and void and or that such vesting should necessarily go with the assumption by bgl of all pgr s obligations owed to third parties  including those unrelated to the joint venture 
in june  the high court issued a preliminary finding in favor of the merchant bank ghana ltd 
while the ruling transferred pgr s ownership position to the liquidator  it did not require bgl to assume any of pgr s obligations 
nevertheless  by september   continued project spending by bgl had diluted pgr s original ownership position to less than 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  if either partner allows itself to be diluted to or less  that partner s residual interest would immediately convert into a net profit interest in potential future earnings from the prestea underground mine 
while the court s ruling has effectively given the net profits interest to the bankruptcy trustee  the trustee still must establish the fair value of the interest and then find a buyer 
at a bankruptcy hearing in december  none of the creditors were willing to fund a valuation study 
we are also engaged in routine litigation incidental to our business none of which is deemed to be material 
no material legal proceedings  involving us or our business are pending  or  to our knowledge  contemplated  by any governmental authority

certain canadian federal income tax considerations the following summarizes the principal canadian federal income tax considerations applicable to the holding and disposition of our common shares by a holder of one or more common shares  who for canadian income tax purposes is resident in the united states of america and holds the common shares as capital property 
this summary is based on the current provisions of the canada united states income tax convention the treaty  income tax act canada the tax act  the regulations there under and all amendments to the tax act publicly proposed by the government of canada to the date hereof 
it is assumed that each such amendment will be enacted as proposed and there is no other relevant change in any governing law  although no assurance can be given in these respects 
limited liability corporations created under the limited liability company legislation of certain us states and treated as a partnership or disregarded entity under us tax law cannot access any of the benefits of the treaty as described in the paragraphs below 
dividends paid or credited by us to a holder of one or more common shares will be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax at the rate of 
under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax is reduced to of the gross amount of the dividend where the holder is a company that owns at least of the company s voting stock and beneficially owns the dividend  and in any other case 
under the tax act  a holder will not be subject to canadian tax on any capital gain realized on an actual or deemed disposition of a common share  including a deemed disposition at death  provided that he did not hold the common share as capital property used in carrying on a business in canada  and that neither he nor persons with whom he did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  owned or have an option or interest in or more of the issued shares of any class of our stock at any time in the month period immediately preceding the disposition 
a holder who is liable under the tax act for canadian tax in respect of a capital gain realized on an actual or deemed disposition of a common share could be relieved under the treaty from such liability unless a the common share formed part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base in canada that the holder has or had within the twelve month period preceding the disposition  or b the holder was an individual  and i was resident in canada for months during any period of consecutive years preceding the disposition  and ii was resident in canada at any time during the ten years immediately preceding the disposition  and iii owned the common share when he ceased to be a resident of canada 
to the extent that no treaty relief is available  generally  one half of any capital gain realized by a holder in a taxation year must be included in the income of the holder for the year  and one half of any capital loss realized by a holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized by the holder in that year 
capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains for that year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years 
a holder is required to file a canadian income tax return if such holder disposes of a common share and the gain or loss is subject to tax in canada  based on the application of the rules outlined in the above paragraphs  even where the treaty applies to relieve the canadian tax liability

shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the income and other tax consequences arising in their particular circumstances 
certain united states federal income tax considerations potential investors that are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we currently are not a pfic and do not expect to become a pfic in the near future  the tests for determining pfic status are dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we can not assure you that we would not become a pfic in the future 
if we were deemed to be a pfic  then a us taxpayer who disposes or is deemed to dispose of our shares at a gain  or who received a so called excess distribution on the shares  generally would be required to treat such gain or excess distribution as ordinary income and pay an interest charge on a portion of the gain or distribution unless the taxpayer makes a timely qualified electing fund election a qef election 
a us taxpayer who makes a qef election generally must report on a current basis his or her share of any of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain for any taxable year in which we are a pfic  whether or not we distribute those earnings 
special estate tax rules could be applicable to our shares if we are classified as a pfic for income tax purposes

the calculations of total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce are in compliance with an industry standard for such measures established in by the gold institute  a non profit industry group 
the following table shows the derivation of these measures and a reconciliation of total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce

we monitor these measures monthly  comparing each month s values to prior period s values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies 
these measures are also compared against budget to alert management to trends that may cause actual results to deviate from planned operational results 
we provide these measures to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines 
we calculate these measures for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis 
total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  gold grade  gold recovery  and the costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are the same as  or similar to the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
all figures and amounts in this item are shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends distributed from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines 
our business through our subsidiaries and joint ventures we own a controlling interest in four significant gold properties in southern ghana in west africa the bogoso prestea property  which comprises the adjoining bogoso and prestea mining leases bogoso prestea  the wassa property wassa  the prestea underground property prestea underground and the st 
jude properties 
bogoso prestea is owned by our owned subsidiary bogoso gold limited bgl 
all of our gold production prior to april came from bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea produced and sold  ounces of gold during through another owned subsidiary  wexford goldfields limited wgl  we own the wassa gold mine located some kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
construction and commissioning of wassa s new processing plant and open pit mine was completed at the end of march and the project was placed in service on april  wassa produced and sold  ounces of gold in following its april in service date 
the prestea underground is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive underground gold mine and associated support facilities 
bgl owns a operating interest in the prestea underground 
we are currently conducting exploration and engineering studies to determine if the underground mine can be reactivated on a profitable basis 
through our owned subsidiary  st 
jude resources ltd 
st 
jude  we own the st 
jude properties in southwest ghana 
the st 
jude properties consist of the hwini butre and benso concessions which together cover an area of square kilometers 
both concessions contain undeveloped zones of gold mineralization 
these two concessions are located between and kilometers south of wassa 
the mineralized zones have been delineated through the efforts of the prior owner who conducted extensive exploration work from the mid s to we hold interests in several gold exploration projects in ghana and elsewhere in africa including sierra leone  ghana  burkina faso  niger and cote d ivoire 
we also hold and manage exploration properties in suriname and french guiana 
we hold indirect interests in gold exploration properties in peru and chile through a shareholding investment in goldmin consolidated holdings 
we also own a interest in euro ressources sa  euro a french registered  publicly traded royalty holding company formerly known as guyanor ressources sa which owns a royalty interest based on gold production at cambior inc s rosebel gold mine in suriname 
our corporate headquarters is located in littleton  colorado 
our accounting records are kept in compliance with canadian gaap and all of our operations  except for certain exploration projects  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
business strategy and development since our business and development strategy has been focused primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
since our exploration efforts have been focused on ghana  other west african countries and south america 
in line with our business strategy we acquired bogoso in and have operated the bogoso processing plant since that time 
in we acquired prestea and have been mining at prestea since late in late we acquired wassa and following completion of a feasibility study  constructed a new cil processing plant at wassa which began commercial operation in april we are currently constructing a new processing plant at bogoso designed to expand production at bogoso prestea from approximately  ounces in to approximately  ounces in based on currently known reserves we expect a mine life of approximately seven years at bogoso prestea 
achievement of this target is subject to numerous risks 
see the discussion of risk factors in item a above 
in late  we acquired the st 
jude properties where we plan to carry out geological and engineering studies during to determine the economic viability of these undeveloped gold properties 
our overall objective since has been to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer which we understand to be a producer with annual production of approximately  ounces 
with the benefit of a full year s production from the bogoso expansion project in  we now anticipate reaching this goal in we continue to actively investigate potential acquisition and merger candidates which could further increase our annual gold production  however we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
significant trends and events during quarterly restatement for and mark to market reporting in the first quarter of  euro implemented hedge accounting for its forward gold pricing derivatives established in january 
euro also used hedge accounting for additional derivatives acquired in august in completing our audited consolidated financial statements for  it was concluded that euro s forward gold pricing derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under cdn gaap  acg  hedging relationships 
as a result  euro will restate its unaudited financial statements and we will restate our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of euro and golden star will now be required to recognize mark to market valuations of euro s forward gold pricing derivatives through the statements of operations at the end of each period 
during  euro and golden star recognized gains and losses from the forward gold pricing derivatives in the statements of operations only in the periods in which they settled 
since euro is a majority owned subsidiary  the impact of these changes flows through to golden star s consolidated financial statements in the same amounts and in the same periods as in euro 
the effect of the change on our first three quarters results are as shown below account first quarter second quarter third quarter in millions  except per share as reported as restated as reported as restated as reported as restated data royalty income loss on derivative provision for future income taxes net loss loss per share basic future tax asset loan fees fair value of derivatives other accrued liabilities golden star will issue restated unaudited quarterly reports on form q as for the first three quarters of  reflecting the impact of these changes 
st 
jude acquisition in late december  we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of st 
jude 
our total cost to acquire st 
jude was million 
this includes issuance of million of our common shares at a price of each  million warrants with an aggregate fair value of million and million options at an aggregate fair value of million and million of transaction costs 
the transaction resulted in st 
jude shareholders holding approximately of golden star on a fully diluted basis at the date of the acquisition 
st 
jude s principal assets are the hwini butre and benso gold projects at the southeastern end of the ashanti gold belt region in ghana 
based on our analysis of st 
jude s past exploration work  we reported in february measured and indicated mineral resources of million tonnes at an average grade of grams per tonne at hwini butre and million tonnes at an average grade of grams per tonne at benso 
in addition  st 
jude has other exploration projects in ghana  burkina faso and niger 
equity financing on december   we closed a bought deal equity offering of approximately million common shares at cdn per common share and realized gross proceeds of approximately cdn million million 
the net proceeds of the offering are being used to fund the development of the bogoso sulfide expansion project and for general corporate purposes 
wassa start up following the completion of construction and commissioning in the first quarter of  the wassa mine was placed in service on april  wassa has since processed million tonnes of ore at an average rate of  tonne per day and an average grade of grams per tonne  and has shipped and sold  ounces of gold 
sale of convertible notes on april  we sold million of senior unsecured convertible notes the notes maturing on april   to a private investment fund 
the notes were issued at par and bear interest at 
the notes are convertible to common shares at a fixed conversion price of per share  a premium to the closing price of the common shares on april  proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for the bogoso sulfide expansion project and for general corporate purposes 
put and call options we purchased gold put options puts during to provide down side gold price protection for a portion of our expected gold sales spread equally over the bogoso sulfide expansion project construction period 
this action reduced the risk of reduced cash flow from operations during the construction period that would otherwise have occurred as a result of a drop in gold prices 
we sold call options calls to offset the cost of a portion of the puts 
each put gives us the right  but not the obligation  to sell an ounce of gold to a counter party on a specified future date at a contractually agreed upon strike price 
each put has a specified expiry date 
the strike price of the put is set at a point below the spot market price on the date the put is established 
the closer the put strike price is to the spot market price  the higher the cost of the put 
we paid an average of per ounce for the puts purchased in the second quarter of locking in an average strike price of per ounce when the spot market price was between and per ounce 
a put  in effect  becomes an insurance policy that guarantees us a minimum gold price on ounces covered by the puts 
through our puts we have guaranteed that we will receive at least per ounce for  ounces to be sold during and early if  on the expiry date  the spot market price is above the put strike price we will allow the put to expire unused 
we are not required to deliver gold to cover a put 
each call obligates us to sell an ounce of gold at a specified future date to a counter party at a contractually agreed upon price 
if the spot market gold price exceeds the call strike price we will receive only the lower call strike price on ounces covered by the calls 
we sell calls to and receive payment from a counterparty 
if the counterparty declines to exercise the call on its expiry date ie the spot market price of gold is below the calls strike price the calls expire unused with no additional financial impact 
in the third quarter of  we bought an additional  puts and at the same time sold  calls 
the strike prices of the calls and the puts were set so that the revenue on the sale of the calls exactly offsets the cost of the puts  and thus no cash was required for the transactions 
the strike price of the puts was set at per ounce and the calls at per ounce 
at the time that these puts and calls were acquired the spot price of gold was between and per ounce 
puts acquired in the second quarter of and outstanding at december  expire as follows  in and  in puts and calls acquired in the third quarter of expire at a rate of  per month between october and march in december we repurchased calls on  ounces at an average price of per covered ounce 
the repurchased calls were for december and january and february derivative accounting rules require that at the end of each period  the remaining unexpired puts and calls be revalued to their mark to market fair value the price at which we could sell the puts or the price at which we could buy back the call options 
the initial mark to market value of the puts was equal to the price we paid for them 
the mark to market values at december  decreased because gold prices rose after we bought the puts thereby making it less likely that the floor price established by the puts would provide a future benefit 
the million decrease in the mark to market value of the puts as of december   has been recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining fair value of the puts at december  was million 
if the gold price were to fall in the future  the mark to market value of the puts would increase since it would be more likely that the floor price mechanism in the puts would provide an economic benefit 
in such a case we would recognize a gain equal to the increase in the mark to market value of the puts 
the value of the call options is also marked to market each period in a manner similar to the put options 
the only difference is that the mark to market value would be based on the price we would have to pay to the counter party to buy back the call options 
as gold prices increase  the value of calls increase 
the fair value of calls the price we would have to pay to buy back the calls was million as of december  and we recognized a non cash expense of this amount in our consolidated statement of operations for the increase in the buy back cost 
it is noted that the mark to market fair value will be brought back into revenue in the statement of operations over the next months 
rand and euro forwards during we established forward contracts for south african rand and for euros 
we took this action to limit the potential impact of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations on the cost of equipment and services we expect to acquire from south african and european vendors during the construction phase of the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
at december  we held forward positions that allow us to buy million south african rand at an average exchange rate of rand per the dollar 
all of these rand forward positions as of december  expire in the fair value of the rand positions at december  was million more than we paid for them 
this gain helped to offset the fair value loss on the puts and calls 
we also held at december  forward positions that allow us to buy million euros at an average exchange rate of euros per the dollar 
at the end of december the fair value our euro positions had dropped resulting in a million loss 
all of these euro forwards expire in the first five months of acquisition of the afema property in march we entered into an agreement allowing us to acquire a interest in the afema gold property in south east cote d ivoire from societe d etat pour le developpement minier de la cote d ivoire 
the government of cote d ivoire retains a interest in this property 
the afema property covers an area of  square kilometers of the sefwi belt meta volcanics and the kumasi basin meta sedimentary rocks which extend into the cote d ivoire 
in ghana  this belt basin contact hosts the multi million ounce chirano and bibiani gold deposits 
in the s approximately  ounces of gold were produced from oxide ores on the afema property from several small open pits along a kilometer strike length 
see afema cote d ivoire discussion above in item description of properties for additional information about the acquisition and activities at afema during temporary mining suspension at bogoso prestea s plant north pit the plant north pit at prestea has been developed in stages with the development of the final stage phase commencing in august initiation of phase mining was conditional on a number of mitigation measures identified in the environmental impact statement 
the ghana environmental protection agency epa requested suspension of mining of the plant north phase pit on september  and of the plant north pit on september  until certain outstanding mitigation measures were completed 
the mitigation measures were completed and inspected by the epa on october  on november   we received approval from the epa to recommence mining operations at the plant north pit and mining activity was recommenced a few days later following a series of informational meetings with the prestea community 
during the mining suspension at plant north  processing operations continued at the bogoso processing plant using stockpiled ore 
mining and processing operations at the wassa mine and construction activities on the bogoso sulfide expansion project also continued without interruption 
environmental reclamation bonds in compliance with ghana epa requirements we provided environmental reclamation bonds during for both bogoso prestea and wassa 
we bonded million to cover future reclamation obligations at wassa  with a million letter of credit and million of cash which was deposited with the epa 
we have also bonded million to cover future reclamation obligations at bogoso prestea  with an million letter of credit and a million cash bond 
euro ressources loans and derivatives on january  euro  a owed subsidiary formerly named guyanor ressources sa  drew down  under a loan agreement  million from a commercial bank and paid the full amount to golden star as the first installment for the purchase of the rosebel participation right the rosebel royalty which it purchased from golden star for million plus contingent future payments based on production from the rosebel mine in excess of million ounces in december in august  euro borrowed an additional million from the same commercial bank and forwarded the proceeds to golden star leaving an outstanding balance due to golden star of million plus the future payments 
as required by the loan agreements  euro also entered into cash settled forward gold pricing agreements with its lender designed to reduce in part the impact of gold price fluctuations on expected future rosebel royalty revenues it receives from cambior inc euro is now seeking funding to allow payment of the final million owed to golden star 
covenants in the loan agreements preclude euro from acquiring any additional debt without the bank s approval 
the first derivative agreement specifies that beginning april  and every three months thereafter until july   when the average gold price for the prior quarter is less than per ounce  the bank will pay to euro in cash an amount equal to  ounces times the difference between the per ounce and the average gold price for the quarter 
in quarters where the average gold price exceeds per ounce  euro will pay cash to the bank in an amount equal to  ounces times the difference between the average gold price and per ounce 
the  ounces is a notional amount agreed to by euro and the bank 
neither euro nor the bank is required to deliver gold under the agreement 
the net effect of the agreement is that euro receives royalty revenue on the first  ounces of gold mined at the rosebel mine each quarter based on per ounce gold price regardless of the actual gold price 
we expect the rosebel mine to produce approximately  ounces of gold per quarter 
as required under the august loan  euro entered into another derivative agreement on  ounces per quarter from october  to january  at a price of per ounce 
the second derivative is structured exactly as the first derivative described above except for the higher agreed sales price 
gold prices averaged   and per ounce during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of resulting in euro making payments to the bank of   and million respectively in the four quarters of since quarterly gold prices exceeded per ounce the forward sales price per the agreement euro s royalty revenues received from cambior on the first  ounces in each quarter of  were higher by the same amounts  thereby exactly offsetting the payments to the bank 
as required by its loan agreement with the bank  all rosebel royalty proceeds are initially deposited with the bank 
funds are subsequently disbursed to euro on an as needed basis 
excess funds retained by the bank are classified as restricted cash on the golden star consolidated balance sheet 
during  euro and golden star reported their unaudited quarterly financial results on the assumption that hedge accounting could be used for the derivatives  but in completing our audited consolidated financial statements for  it was concluded that euro s forward gold pricing derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under cdn gaap  acg  hedging relationships 
as a result  euro and golden star will restate their unaudited financial statements for the first three quarters of as discussed above 
euro and golden star will now be required to recognize mark to market valuations of euro s forward gold pricing derivatives through the statements of operations at the end of each period 
since euro is a majority owned subsidiary  the impact of these changes flows through to golden star s consolidated financial statements in the same amounts and in the same periods as in euro 
euro private placement euro sold four million of its common shares at euro each in a private placement in december raising euro million 
euro also received  as part of the same transaction  euro million from the sale of million warrants which allow the holder to purchase euro s common shares at euro each until december  euro plans to use the proceeds to augment its working capital and to pursue new investment opportunities 
based on the dilutive effect of the private placement on golden star s ownership position and on a zero value in euro s minority interest account  golden star recognized a million gain on the transaction 
gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last five years  from a low of just under per ounce in early to a high above per ounce in january much of the price increase during this period appears to be related to decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other major foreign currencies  but in recent quarters prices appear to be responding to additional influences with a resulting increase in the rate of increase 
our realized gold price for shipments during averaged per ounce compared to per ounce average price received in illegal mining there has been a significant increase in illegal gold mining in ghana over the past two years which has impacted most of the gold producers in the country including us 
this trend is raising concern about property rights  environmental degradation  security and safety issues 
many of the major producers  including golden star  have sought government assistance to find peaceful and equitable resolutions to these problems 
most of the illegal mining on our properties has taken place at prestea  particularly toward the southern end of the prestea property 
due to security concerns and our policy of avoiding unnecessary confrontation  we have limited access to many of the areas on our property where illegal mining is occurring 
as a result we have not been able to update estimates made in the fourth quarter of of gold illegally removed from our property 
in addition  we have not been able to carry out a comprehensive survey of the environmental degradation caused by the illegal miners  but aerial surveys indicate it is extensive and it includes improper disposal of waste  mercury pollution from the mercury used by the illegal miners to recover the gold  deforestation and possible acid mine drainage 
in february  ghana government authorities resolved formally  with the support of the chamber of mines and other stakeholders  that illegal mining would not be tolerated and accordingly notice was given by the ghana government to illegal miners nationwide that they were to cease all illegal mining operations 
in particular  the government singled out illegal miners who are operating on our bogoso prestea property  and the government announced that they would undertake measures using government security agencies to remove the illegal miners if they did not voluntarily depart 
the notice given by the ghana government has expired 
separately  the ghanaian minister for lands  forestry and mines commenced an initiative to simplify the process for persons to become legitimate small scale miners and to identify suitable areas for legitimate small scale mining 
several areas  which are outside our property holdings  have been designated by the ghana minerals commission for such purposes 
the ghana government and its agencies have also carried out educational programs for the illegal miners and the nearby communities relating to the negative social  health and environmental impacts of illegal mining 
the program also seeks to make illegal miners aware of the government s small scale mining initiative and educates them on environmental and safety issues 
we  and most of the other gold mining companies working in ghana  are working closely with the ghana government to reduce tensions in the area and to reduce the risk of an escalation of the situation and possible injury to people and damage to property 
unfortunately  the actions proposed by the government have caused unrest in the community at prestea resulting in a number of protests and demonstrations during which violence has occurred and during which illegal miners have entered our pits where they damaged property and removed ore 
results of operations compared to summary summary we incurred a net loss of million or per share on revenues of million during versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during while gold revenues in were million higher than in  due mostly to production from our new wassa mine and from higher realized gold prices  operating costs were million higher  also due mostly to costs from wassa and increased costs at bogoso prestea 
the major factors contributing to the million swing in operating results include a million operating loss at wassa  a million reduction in operating income at bogoso prestea on lower gold production and higher operating costs and a million unrealized  non cash mark to market adjustment for the euro derivatives 
in addition  a million increase in interest expense and million of impairment write offs of exploration properties were partially offset by a million reduction in corporate development costs  a million increase in royalty income and a million gain from sale of common shares by our subsidiary euro 
recognition of a million tax asset at euro  the recognition of a million tax asset related to the sale of moto shares and a million increase in tax assets at bgl reduced our net loss by million

gold production was down  ounces in versus due to a combination of lower plant through put and lower gold recovery  both of which were caused by the metallurgical characteristics of the deeper  harder non refractory sulfide plant north ores processed in versus the shallower and softer oxide and non refractory sulfide ores milled in the first five months of benefited from the oxide ores processed in that period which yield higher mill throughput rates  better recovery and lower operating costs than did the transition and non refractory sulfide ores processed during processing of low grade stock pile material in september and october  during the epa s requested mining stoppage also contributed to the decrease in ounces of gold sold 
bogoso prestea operating results ore mined t    waste mined t    ore processed t    grade processed g t recovery gold sold oz    cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz mining costs in increased million at bogoso prestea versus increases in fuel and labor charges accounted for approximately half of the increase in costs 
the balance of the increase was a combination of higher costs for supplies and consumables including explosives  ore haulage contracts  drilling supplies  grinding balls  maintenance and tires 
the bogoso processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne  as compared to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the same period in gold recovery dropped to in from in  the higher recovery in a function of the oxide ore processed in the first half of the lower gold output and higher mine operating costs resulted in a significant increase in unit costs 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce in  compared to per ounce in  and total cash costs averaged per ounce  up from per ounce in wassa operations the wassa operating results discussed below are for the nine month period following wassa s april  in service date 
there was no production from wassa in and wassa generated a million after tax operating loss in the nine months ended december  on sales of  ounces of gold 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce and total cash costs averaged per ounce

wassa operating results ore mined t  waste mined t  ore processed t  grade processed g t recovery gold sold oz  cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz overall  wassa s operating results were disappointing 
we had anticipated higher mill through put  higher grades  and lower operating costs than those achieved 
operating costs were adversely impacted early in the year by high power costs from our diesel fired  on site power plant 
this was remedied by late june when wassa was connected to the national power grid 
mining costs were also higher than expected early in the year as we utilized contract miners and used smaller than optimal  rented mining equipment 
by the end of we had completed the acquisition of our own fleet of new nominal tonne haulage trucks and hydraulic loaders 
the lower power costs and more efficient mining equipment should contribute to lower costs during several design bottlenecks were discovered at the processing plant during wassa s first nine months of operations and certain improvements were made during the year  but at year end we were still dealing with frequent plant blockages mostly related to the high clay content of the weathered  near surface ores mined and processed in by the end of we had mined to sufficient depth in the pit to access fresher ores which have lower clay content and which we expect will reduce some of the plant blockage problems in the future 
as a result we expect better mill throughput in finally  as we progress deeper into the fresh ore we expect the ore grades to improve 
the higher grades are also expected to help achieve higher gold recovery rates 
derivatives the million in unrealized  non cash mark to market losses were mostly a result of the impact of higher gold prices on euro s forward gold price agreements a loss of before tax of million  golden star s calls a loss of million  and puts a loss of million 
our euro currency accounts lost million 
a million mark to market gain on the forward rand positions partially offset the put  call and euro losses 
euro also recognized a million reduction in royalty revenues for cash payments made related to its derivative positions  such payments being related to increases in gold prices during the year 
interest the increase in interest expense is a function of increased balances on equipment financing loans  euro s bank loans and interest on the million of convertible notes sold during in addition to the interest expense shown on the consolidated statement of operations  million of interest was capitalized as part of the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
other revenues and costs the operating and non operating losses and higher costs were partly offset by a million increase in royalty income from the rosebel royalty related to higher gold prices and increased output from cambior inc s rosebel mine 
the increase in the royalty also reflects the fact that the rosebel mine and its associated royalty did not commence production until near the end of the first quarter in  yielding only a partial year of operations in corporate development charges in were down from when we incurred million of expense in an unsuccessful merger attempt 
compared to net income for totaled million or per share on revenues of million  versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during higher gold prices and ore grades in were more than offset by decreased gold production  higher costs per ounce and million of corporate development expenses mostly related to an unsuccessful merger attempt 
recognition of future tax assets added million to net income in versus nil in the prior year 
realized gold prices averaged per ounce for the year  a increase from the per ounce realized in gold revenues were based on sales of  ounces  a decrease from  ounces in the change in ore type during was the major factor contributing to the reduced gold output versus the prior year 
during we processed exclusively oxide ores while during most of we processed harder and more complex transition and non refractory sulfide ores which  due to the harder ore and complex metallurgy  resulted in lower gold recovery and lower plant throughput 
we processed a mixture of oxide  transition and non refractory sulfide ores in the first half of and a mixture of transition and non refractory ores in the second half of the year 
gold recovery averaged during the first half of but dropped to approximately in the second half 
plant throughput averaged  tonnes per day in the first half of the year but decreased to  tonnes per day in the second half 
unusually high rainfall also impeded ore availability and plant efficiency in the third quarter by causing flooding in the pit and wet ore handling problems at the processing plant 
as anticipated  operating costs increased both in absolute terms and on a per unit basis at bogoso prestea during due primarily to the harder nature of the transition and non refractory sulfide ores processed after april increases in fuel and electric power costs added approximately million to operating costs during the year 
plant maintenance  explosives  liner costs and grinding media costs all increased by a total of approximately million as compared to the harder ore required increased amounts of certain consumables which increased costs by another million 
we also experienced increased costs in other maintenance areas  labor  community assistance  camp costs and other overhead areas 
a reduction in work in process inventory and a million provision for redundancies also contributed to the higher costs 
the lower gold output and higher mine operating costs resulted in a significant increase in unit costs 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce  compared to per ounce in  and total cash costs averaged per ounce  up from per ounce in depreciation and amortization were higher than in mostly due to the amortization costs of new assets added in late and in such as the flotation plant at bogoso 
increases in corporate general and administrative costs contributed to the lower income versus higher compensation costs relating to additional administrative personnel relative to  increases in investor relations costs  higher insurance costs  sarbanes oxley compliance costs and an overall higher level of corporate activity in response to the growth of the company all contributed to the increase in general and administrative costs 
a million tax benefit was recorded during recognition of a deferred tax asset was deemed appropriate at the end of in light of the continued operating profits at bgl 
we have substantial tax assets in canada and france mostly due to past losses  capital allowances and tax pools  but a tax valuation allowance has been provided in an amount equal to net tax assets in these jurisdictions 
development projects bogoso sulfide expansion project nearly of the remaining ore reserves at bogoso prestea are refractory and cannot be processed at our existing plant 
we therefore made a decision in june to construct a new million tonne per annum processing facility at bogoso alongside the existing non refractory processing plant 
the new plant  which is currently under construction  will utilize the proprietary biox r bio oxidation technology to treat the refractory sulfide ore 
when completed in late  the new sulfide processing plant and the existing cil plant are together expected to process a combined million tonnes per year 
the existing cil mill will retain its current configuration and will continue to process non refractory ores during the construction phase of the new biox r plant 
after the new biox r plant comes on line  it is anticipated that the existing bogoso cil plant will process mostly oxide ores and the biox r plant will process mostly refractory sulfide ores and mixed oxide refractory ores 
the two plants sitting side by side are expected to provide operational efficiencies since they will share common management  labor  reagent inventories  warehouse parts and maintenance efforts 
and with the two plants and their differing technologies  we should be able to effectively process all of the ore types known to exist in the bogoso prestea area 
construction work is proceeding within schedule and budget 
ordering of long lead time items is substantially complete as is the detailed engineering design 
concrete work is well progressed for all of the equipment 
the stainless steel biox r reactor tanks have been erected and structural steel erection is commencing 
erection of the cil tanks is also nearing completion which will allow structural steel erection to also commence in this area 
the electrical contractor has mobilized and has commenced work 
the crusher and new sag mill were shipped to ghana in march and the ball mill is already on site and mounted on its pedestal 
the design and construction of the expansion project is being managed by grd minproc on an engineering  procurement and construction management basis 
work has proceeded under a letter of agreement entered into in february and a definitive contract is expected to be finalized shortly 
during the first several years of its life  the new biox r plant is expected to process sulfide ores from pits on the bogoso property 
pre stripping at two of these sulfide pits is now underway using new mining equipment acquired since mid the non refractory plant will continue to process non refractory ores from the plant north pit at prestea until completion of mining in the fourth quarter of afterward we plan to feed the non refractory plant with oxide ores from pampe  mampon and various areas on the south end of the prestea property 
we estimate that the total capital cost of the new sulfide plant project  including the expansion of the mining fleet  to be approximately million  and expect construction to be completed by late at the end of approximately million of the total had been spent 
in  following completion of the biox r plant  we expect combined gold production from the two bogoso plants to be approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost of per ounce 
based on our metallurgical testwork  gold recoveries from the biox r process are expected to average and vary between and 
prestea underground underground drilling and sampling continued during at the prestea underground resulting in an increase in the non reserve inferred resource of million tonnes at an average grade of grams per tonne 
by the end of dewatering efforts had provided access to some of the lowest levels of the old workings and new drills were mobilized underground to start work on the deep levels where ore grade material was being extracted when mining ceased in we intend to accelerate the underground drilling  especially at the lower levels during and expect to have a much better assessment of the potential of the underground potential by year end st 
jude properties we have budgeted approximately million of exploration work during on the st 
jude properties including the evaluation of several previously untested areas on the st 
jude properties 
if our exploration  testing and studies verify st 
jude s earlier exploration results we would anticipate releasing mineral reserve numbers for the st 
jude properties during exploration projects total expenditures on exploration activities in were million  down slightly from million in during we plan to continue our exploration efforts to identify exploration opportunities and new resources in africa  south america and elsewhere 
the main exploration focus in was to increase the level of confidence in our resources and reserves around our existing mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa  and to use our knowledge of the regional geology of southwest ghana and adjacent areas to acquire and explore properties that provide significant synergies with our existing operations 
exploration in ghana during our exploration in ghana focused on converting resources to reserves  and defining mineralization that could be economically processed through our existing facilities at bogoso and wassa 
the ghana exploration activities totaled approximately million and accounted for approximately of our exploration spending including o drilling of refractory sulfide mineralization at chujah and dumasi at bogoso  which converted a substantial proportion of the previously inferred and indicated resources to reserves 
these reserves will underpin the bogoso sulfide expansion project currently nearing completion 
o drilling around the south akyempim zone at wassa  which delineated significant new zones of mineralization at higher grades and provided the basis for most of the net increase in reserves at wassa 
o drilling at pampe on the akropong trend west of bogoso  which defined a modest non refractory resource which potentially can be processed through the bogoso oxide circuit commencing in late and in o drilling at mampon  which increased the confidence in the reserves there in preparation for permitting for mining in and only limited drilling of oxide targets was undertaken during  with the emphasis on increasing sulfide reserves to support bogoso sulfide expansion project 
exploration elsewhere in africa exploration continued on our mano river joint venture in sierra leone  with regional soil sampling programs revealing major new zones of gold anomalism on the pampana and sonfon properties 
in we plan to more closely define these anomalies with further soil sampling prior to drilling 
in early we entered into an option to purchase the square kilometer afema property in southeast cote d ivoire 
this property lies within extensions of the prolific birimian sefwi belt  which in ghana hosts the multi million ounce ahafo  bibiani and chirano deposits 
initial exploration has revealed extensive new gold in soil anomalies that will be a focus for further exploration in following disappointing results from the mininko joint venture in mali  this project was dropped in the first quarter of exploration on the guiana shield due to similarities in the geology and ages of the rocks  we consider the guiana shield in the northeast corner of south america as a geological extension of the west african shield where our ghanaian properties are located 
following a restructuring of our holdings on the guiana shield during we have revitalized our exploration there  with an emphasis on our properties in suriname and french guiana 
in suriname we completed a limited diamond core drilling program at saramacca to test a previously identified kilometer long gold in soil anomaly  termed anomaly m 
this drilling returned encouraging results from a number of holes  and in we plan to follow up the initial relatively shallow drilling with a second phase of core drilling to test the mineralization at greater depths 
in french guiana we completed broad spaced first pass soil sampling on the bon espoir property  targeting a major mineralized shear zone 
initial results have not been encouraging but have highlighted the regional potential of the structure for future work 
opportunities we have budgeted million for exploration in  and intend to focus our efforts on core assets in ghana  including the newly acquired st jude properties at hwini butre and benso 
key areas where we plan to be active include o mineralized areas around the operating mines  o prestea underground  where we have intensified exploration to allow feasibility upper levels and scoping studies deep levels to commence in early  o prestea south bondaye area  where we plan to resume drilling of the known oxide targets to allow feasibility and permitting to be completed by end o hwini butre and benso  where intensive drilling programs are planned to be undertaken to allow feasibility and permitting by the end of by the end of  dewatering efforts at the prestea underground had cleared the lowest sections of the old underground workings and an extensive underground drilling program has been initiated which will continue during most of to test areas immediately below the deepest old workings 
we believe these deeper levels provide the best opportunities for significant new discoveries in the prestea underground 
we intend to complete an initial feasibility study by the end of evaluating the economic potential of restarting production from the prestea underground mine 
other opportunities include o saramacca anomaly m in suriname  where we plan to follow up the encouraging drilling  o cote d ivoire and sierra leone  where we plan to advance our interests to key decision points  liquidity and capital resources operations generated million of cash during the year 
this compares to million of cash generated by operations in lower gold output at bogoso prestea and higher than expected operating costs at both bogoso prestea and wassa contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations 
financing activities provided million of cash in new debt  including equipment financing loans  convertible notes and bank loans accounted for million of the total and an equity offering in december contributed million after issuance costs 
option and warrant exercises yielded million of cash during capital assets and capital projects including deferred exploration  new mining equipment and our major development projects used million during the year 
approximately million was spent on the bogoso sulfide project during including construction costs of the new sulfide plant and additional sulfide development drilling in and around the sulfide pits at bogoso 
a total of million was spent on plant and equipment needs with completion of construction of the new plant at wassa  new mining equipment at wassa and bogoso and development drilling in and around wassa and bogoso prestea being the major items making up the total 
a total of million was spent on exploration projects outside the wassa and bogoso prestea operation areas 
our cash and cash equivalent balance stood at million at december   up from million at the end of at december   working capital was million  versus million at the end of liquidity outlook capital expenditure plans for include the following projects amount capital spending millions development bogoso expansion project bogoso prestea pre stripping and inventory build up pampe mampon st 
jude properties sustaining capital bogoso prestea prestea underground care and maintenance wassa exploration bogoso prestea prestea underground wassa st 
jude properties other total approximately of the expected bogoso expansion project spending is scheduled in the first half of and of all capital spending is scheduled in the first three quarters of cash on hand stood at million at december  at current gold prices approximately per ounce we expect both bogoso prestea and wassa to generate positive operating cash flows in  but this source of funding along with the million of cash at the start of  will not meet all of our growth needs 
in march  we exercised the remaining moto warrants bringing our total moto ownership to six million shares and immediately sold all the shares in a bought deal transaction in canada for cdn per share 
the sale of the six million shares resulted in net proceeds to golden star of cdn million million 
we are currently negotiating with banks to set up a million revolving line of credit that could be drawn on if we find that cash from operations and cash on hand  including proceeds from the moto shares in march  are not sufficient to meet our projected needs 
we may also consider selling other non key assets if necessary to complete our capital plans during looking ahead our main objectives for include o completion of mining and commencement of reclamation at the prestea plant north pit  o permitting and commencement of oxide mining from pampe on the akropong trend west of bogoso  to provide oxide ore to the bogoso plant following exhaustion of the prestea plant north ores  o commencement of sulfide mining at bogoso  o completion of construction and commissioning of the bogoso sulfide expansion project by the end of  o achievement of improved production rates and costs at wassa  o a continued high level of exploration effort  o continued evaluation of the prestea underground potential  o assimilation and further exploration of the st 
jude properties  and o continuation of efforts to identify and pursue acquisition and growth opportunities in ghana and elsewhere 
we expect gold production at bogoso prestea during to total approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost for the year of per ounce 
we expect production in the first quarter to be  ounces at a commensurately higher cash operating cost reflecting scheduled lower throughput and grades in that quarter 
production is the expected to increase gradually through the second and third quarter  and significantly in the fourth quarter when production from the new biox r facility is expected to commence 
we expect gold production at wassa to total approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
we expect production in the first quarter of about  ounces and for production to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year as a result of improving throughput and increasing grade 
cash operating costs should decrease significantly after the first quarter due to a lower stripping ratio through the rest of the year and should improve gradually through the remaining three quarters commensurately with the increasing grade and gold production profile 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors item a above  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
mining in ghana we regularly monitor and evaluate the social and political aspects of ghana in particular and of west africa in general to apprise ourselves of the social situation and political risks that exist in the region 
ghana has benefited from an extended period of political stability and a democratic governmental system including orderly governmental transitions via free elections 
it is our belief that ghana is committed to creating a stable political and economic environment that will foster additional economic growth 
ghana is endowed with abundant mineral resources and is actively pursuing policies designed to support expansion of its mineral industry 
because of the political stability and supportive policies  several international mineral companies have initiated exploration and mining activities in ghana in recent years and we are now seeing some of these companies making significant investments in gold exploration and development 
it is our policy and our intent to be a responsible corporate citizen of ghana and as such we have worked diligently to establish good working relationships with both local and national governmental authorities as well as with the local citizens in the areas adjacent to our operations 
recently  however  we have experienced ongoing and escalating incidents of artisanal miners illegally working on our properties in ghana 
while we are sympathetic to the economic needs of those engaged in this activity  such mining is illegal  unsafe and results in uncontrolled environmental damage 
in addition  failure to discourage illegal mining on our properties could jeopardize legal title to our mineral rights 
as such we have sought to stop this activity both by dialogue with the government and by establishing a security presence 
the governmental authorities in western ghana are aware of the illegal mining situation and have been of assistance in our efforts to discourage such activity but more needs to be done 
seasonality most of our operations are in tropical climates which experience annual rainy seasons 
typically mining operations are not materially affected by the rainy seasons in ghana but unusually high rainfall in the late summer of impeded mine production at bogoso prestea and also interrupted underground drilling in the prestea underground 
exploration efforts in ghana and in the guiana shield in south america are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under cdn gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  tax assets and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties  subject to impairment analysis  are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
we have written off substantially all of our pre investments in exploration properties based upon our assessments of the amounts recoverable from these properties 
additional exploration properties have been found to be impaired and were written off in  and we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have significant value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
o ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile  the number of contained ounces based on assay data  and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method 
stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore including applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average mining cost per tonne for material processed 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the mill 
a adjustment of the stockpile value  based on stockpile levels in recent periods  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million and a change in operating costs would yield the same amount 
o impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future including gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  reclamation spending  ore reserves and capital expenditures 
a review of bogoso prestea s and wassa s expected future cash flows as of december  indicated that there is no impairment 
o mining properties mine properties recorded on our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated reserves could result in an approximately million annual change in amortization expense 
o tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
o asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mining operation of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred in the future as required to complete the reclamation and environmental remediation work mandated by existing laws  regulations and customs 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements section non monetary transactions issued in june  replaces the previous recommendations of section and establishes new guidelines for the evaluation and disclosure relating to non monetary transactions 
its provisions determine whether a non monetary transaction is to be measured at fair value or at book value 
this section will be effective for non monetary transactions concluded in periods beginning on or after january  section comprehensive income introduces new disclosure requirements regarding comprehensive income and its components  as well as net income  in its financial statements 
as a consequence  certain unrealized gains and losses  which would otherwise be excluded from the calculation of net income and be assigned directly to shareholders equity  will be used to calculate comprehensive income 
this section will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we will adopt this new requirement in our reporting 
section financial instruments  recognition and measurement determines the time and value at which a financial instrument must be recorded in the balance sheet 
in some cases  it may be measured at fair value or  in other cases  at cost 
the standard also provides for the manner in which gains and losses related to financial instruments are to be recorded 
this section will be effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning on or after october  we will adopt this new requirement in our january reporting 
section financial instruments disclosures and presentation replaces section financial instruments disclosure and presentation  and establishes requirements for presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and non financial derivatives 
section hedges provides guidance for hedge accounting when applied to certain derivatives that meet the definition of a hedge 
application of section to derivatives that qualify as hedges is optional  but once a derivative is classified as a hedge  the provisions of section are then mandatory 
section replaces acg  hedging relationships and completes the provisions of section  foreign currency translation  by addressing how to account for hedges and related disclosure of information requirements 
this section will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we will adopt this new requirement in our january reporting 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contractual obligations contractual obligations payment due by period thousands as of december  total less than to years to years more than year years long term debt     interest on long term debt     operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations      total      includes million of convertible notes maturing in golden star has the right to repay the million in cash or in common shares at the due date under certain circumstances 
the presentation shown above assumes payment is made in cash and also assumes no conversions of the debt to common shares by the note holders prior to the maturity date 
other long term liabilities represent asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations include several estimates about future reclamation costs  mining schedules  timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves which in turn determine the ultimate closure date  which in turn impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities 
the discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet of million as of december  the amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements 
outstanding share data this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation includes information available to march  as of march  we had outstanding  common shares  options to acquire  common shares  warrant to acquire  common shares and convertible notes which are convertible into  common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price fluctuations and equity price risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we invest excess cash in high quality short term debt instruments 
the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result  our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that  given the cash balances expected during  a change in interest rates would result in a to million change in annual interest income 
we have both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december  we had million of variable rate debt which carries an interest rate of libor plus 
we estimate that a increase in the interest rate on the variable rate debt would result in a million change in annual interest expense 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk while our major operating units transact most of their business in us dollars  many purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south african rand and ghanaian cedis 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs incurred at our operations 
gold is sold throughout the world based principally on the us dollar price  but portions of our operating expenses and some of our capital purchases are incurred in currencies other than the us dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases production costs and the cost of capital assets in us dollar terms at mines located outside the us  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases production costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalent investments denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
while in the past we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  during we entered into forward purchase contracts for the south african rand and the euro to hedge expected future purchases of capital assets in south africa and europe associated mostly with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a per ounce change in our average realized price of gold for would result in a million to million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows 
during  to reduce the risk of unfavorable gold price fluctuations on our operating cash flows during the construction period of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  we purchased puts to lock in minimum gold prices for portions of our expected gold sales in  and as of december  we have  put options remaining which establish an average minimum price of per ounce on  ounces of expected gold production spread monthly through and early we also sold calls during to offset a portion of the costs of purchasing the puts 
at december  we had  call options remaining which expire in and early  each carrying a strike price of per ounce 
since the rosebel royalty revenues received by euro fluctuate with gold prices  euro s loan agreements required that euro enter into a series of cash settled forward gold price agreements with the lender designed to eliminate a portion of the potential impact of gold price fluctuations on expected future rosebel royalty revenues 
these cash settled forward gold price agreements meet the definition of a derivative 
during  euro and golden star reported their unaudited quarterly financial results assuming hedge accounting could be used for the derivatives  but in completing our audited consolidated financial statements for  it was concluded that euro s forward gold pricing derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under cdn gaap  acg  hedging relationships 
as a result  euro and golden star will restate their unaudited financial statements for the first three quarters of euro and golden star will now be required to recognize mark to market valuations of euro s forward gold pricing derivatives through the statements of operations at the end of each period  which is likely to create large unrealized  non cash losses if gold prices continue to rise 
since euro is a majority owned subsidiary  the impact of these changes flows through to golden star s consolidated financial statements in the same amounts and in the same periods as in euro 
we are experiencing significant price increases in certain operating consumables including fuel  cyanide  tires  and other chemical reagents used in our processing plants 
fuel prices have risen from per liter in september to in september and we have seen a increase in the price of cyanide 
the price paid for several other consumables  including truck tires  have risen to in the past months 
equity price risk we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common shares 
movements in the price of our common shares have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell new common shares at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise
