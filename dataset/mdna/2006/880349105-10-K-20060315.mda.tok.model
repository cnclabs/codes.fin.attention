item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as you read the following review of our financial condition and results of operations  you should also read our financial statements and related notes beginning on page executive summary we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of automotive emission control and ride control products and systems 
we serve both original equipment oe vehicle manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets  or aftermarket  globally through leading brands  including monroe r  rancho r  clevite r elastomers and fric rot tm ride control products and walker r  fonos tm  and gillet tm emission control products 
worldwide we serve more than different original equipment manufacturers  and our products or systems are included on nine of the top passenger car models produced for sale in western europe and all of the top light truck models produced for sale in north america for during  our aftermarket customers were comprised of full line and specialty warehouse distributors  retailers  jobbers  installer chains and car dealers 
we operate more than manufacturing facilities worldwide and employ approximately  people to service our customers demands 
factors that are critical to our success include winning new business awards  managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs  maintaining competitive wages and benefits  maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes  fixing or eliminating unprofitable businesses and reducing overall costs 
in addition  our ability to adapt to key industry trends  such as the consolidation of oe customers  increasing technologically sophisticated content  changing aftermarket distribution channels  increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts  also plays a critical role in our success 
other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to environmental and economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the impact of any such cost increases through material substitutions  cost reduction initiatives and other methods 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  with total debt  net of cash balances  of billion as of december  as such  our ability to generate cash both to fund operations and service our debt is also a significant area of focus for our company 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of cash flows 
total revenues for were billion  a five percent increase over higher aftermarket sales in north america and europe as well as the company s position on strong selling oe platforms globally primarily drove this increase 
the balanced distribution of our customers  geographies  markets  products and platforms allowed us to outperform light vehicle market production rates in a difficult auto environment 
gross margin for was percent  down percent from percent in higher gross steel costs of million  fuel surcharges on transportation costs  restructuring charges and business mix more than offset savings and improved efficiencies from lean manufacturing  six sigma programs  cost recoveries and other cost reduction initiatives 
we reported selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses for of percent of revenues  as compared to percent of revenues for the improvement was driven by restructuring savings  six sigma programs and tight discretionary spending controls 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit was million for  up million from the million reported in stronger global volumes  lower selling  general  administrative and engineering costs  restructuring savings  benefits from the company s ongoing manufacturing efficiency programs and reduced costs through tight controls on discretionary spending helped drive this improvement 
in october and july  we announced changes in the structure of our organization which changed the components of our reportable segments 
the european segment now includes our south american and indian operations 
the asia pacific segment includes our other asian and australian operations 
while this had no impact on our consolidated results  it changed our segment results 
these changes in segment reporting have been reflected in this management s discussion and analysis  and the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for all periods presented 
in february  we acquired substantially all the exhaust assets  and assumed certain related liabilities of  gabilan manufacturing  inc  a privately held company that had developed and manufactured motorcycle exhaust systems for harley davidson motorcycles since the company also produced aftermarket muffler kits for harley davidson 
we purchased gabilan s assets  including working capital adjustments  for million in cash 
gabilan generated approximately million in revenue for the eleven month period ended december in december  we completed the acquisition of the minority interest of the joint venture partner for our indian ride control operations 
we purchased the minority owned interest for approximately million in cash and property 
years and net sales and operating revenues the following tables reflect our revenues for the years of and we present these reconciliations of revenues in order to reflect the trend in our sales in various product lines and geographic regions separately from the effects of doing business in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  substrate sales previously referred to as pass through catalytic converter sales include precious metals pricing  which may be volatile 
these substrate sales occur when  at the direction of our oe customers  we purchase catalytic converters or components thereof from suppliers  use them in our manufacturing process  and sell them as part of the completed system 
while our original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility  it impacts our reported revenue 
excluding substrate sales removes this impact 
we have not reflected any currency impact in the table since this is the base period for measuring the effects of currency during on our operations 
we use this information to analyze the trend in our revenues before these factors 
we believe investors find this information useful in understanding period to period comparisons in our revenues

total north american oe revenues increased three percent to  million in oe emission control revenues were up one percent to  million from  million in the prior year 
substrate emission control sales decreased percent to million in adjusted for substrate sales and currency  oe emission control sales were up seven percent from the prior year 
oe ride control revenues for increased nine percent from the prior year driven primarily by higher sales to heavy duty vehicle manufacturers 
total oe revenues  excluding substrate sales and currency  increased eight percent in  while north american light vehicle production remained flat compared to a year ago 
we experienced this improvement despite the flat build rate primarily due to favorable light vehicle platform mix  highlighted by a percent increase in sales to the japanese oems  as well as higher heavy duty volumes 
in addition  our february acquisition of the exhaust business for harley davidson provided a million revenue contribution 
aftermarket revenues for north america were million in  representing an increase of four percent compared to the same period in the prior year despite general market softness as higher gas prices tempered consumer spending for routine car maintenance 
aftermarket ride control revenues increased million or six percent in  primarily due to increased sales to new and existing customers 
aftermarket emission control revenues were million in  flat compared to prior year 
price increases driven by higher steel costs helped offset lower emission volumes 
our european  south american and indian segment s revenues increased million or nine percent in compared to last year 
total europe oe revenues were  million  up seven percent from last year 
oe emission control revenues increased seven percent to  million from  million in the prior year 
excluding a million increase in substrate sales and million of unfavorable currency  oe emission control revenues increased percent over we experienced this revenue increase despite the relatively flat european light vehicle build rate due to the ramp up of platforms that launched in late and early oe ride control revenues increased by million in  up six percent from million a year ago 
this increase was greater than the european light vehicle production level  which was flat compared to prior year levels 
our increase was greater than the market as a result of the expansion of our electronic suspension business as well as a ramp up of business and new launches with nissan  suzuki  dacia  toyota  mazda and audi 
we changed our reporting in the second quarter of for an assembly only contract with a european oe ride control customer and began accounting for those revenues as net of the related cost of sales 
if we had reported our revenues in the same manner  they would have been lower by million 
excluding an million benefit from currency appreciation  oe ride control revenues increased three percent 
european aftermarket sales were million in compared to million last year 
excluding million of unfavorable currency  european aftermarket revenues increased two percent in compared to last year 
ride control aftermarket revenues  excluding the impact of currency  were even with the prior year  reflecting heightened competition  a soft market environment in spain  and weaker exports worldwide due to the strengthening of the euro 
aftermarket emission control revenues were up three percent from prior year excluding the benefits of currency 
new customers and market share gains helped to partially offset significant market declines relating to now standard use of longer lasting stainless steel by oe manufacturers 
south american and indian revenues  excluding the benefits of currency appreciation and substrate sales  were up percent to million compared to last year 
higher oe volumes and substrate sales as well as improved product mix and pricing drove this increase 
revenues from our asia pacific segment  which includes australia and asia  decreased million to million in  as compared to million in the prior year

ebit years ended december  change millions north america europe  south america and india asia pacific the ebit results shown in the preceding table include the following items  discussed below under restructuring and other charges and liquidity and capital resources capitalization  which have an effect on the comparability of ebit results between periods years ended december  millions north america restructuring and restructuring related expenses new aftermarket customer changeover costs consulting fees indexed to stock price europe  south america and india restructuring and restructuring related expenses consulting fees indexed to stock price asia pacific restructuring and restructuring related expenses consulting fees indexed to stock price represents costs associated with changing new aftermarket customers from their prior suppliers to an inventory of our products 
although our aftermarket business regularly incurs changeover costs  we specifically identify in the table above those changeover costs that  based on the size or number of customers involved  we believe are of an unusual nature for the quarter in which they were incurred 
ebit for north american operations increased to million from million one year ago 
higher oe volumes increased ebit by million with improved oe manufacturing efficiencies and lower selling  general and administrative costs adding million and million  respectively  to ebit 
these improvements to ebit were partially offset by oe price concessions and steel cost increases  net of other material costs savings and recovery from customers 
north american aftermarket ebit was negatively impacted by higher steel costs of million and lower volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies of million 
these decreases were partially offset by lower selling  general  administrative and engineering costs of million and other material cost savings and recovery from customers

restructuring and other charges over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations 
these plans were approved by the board of directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business 
prior to the change in accounting required for exit or disposal activities  we recorded charges to income related to these plans for costs that did not benefit future activities in the period in which the plans were finalized and approved  while actions necessary to affect these restructuring plans occurred over future periods in accordance with established plans 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan  a project known as project genesis  designed to lower our fixed costs  improve efficiency and utilization  and better optimize our global footprint 
project genesis involved closing eight facilities  improving the process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement at facilities  relocating production among facilities  and centralizing some functional areas 
the total of all these restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of was million before tax  million after tax  or per diluted common share 
we eliminated positions in connection with project genesis 
additionally  we executed this plan more efficiently than originally anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of reduced our reserves related to this restructuring activity by million  which was recorded in cost of sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified million of severance reserve to the asset impairment reserve 
this reclassification became necessary  as actual asset impairments along with the sale of our closed facilities were different than the original estimates 
we completed the remaining restructuring activities under project genesis as of the end of since project genesis was announced  we have undertaken a number of related projects designed to restructure our operations  described below 
in the first quarter of  we incurred severance costs of million associated with eliminating salaried positions through selective layoffs and an early retirement program 
additionally  hourly positions were eliminated through selective layoffs in the quarter 
these reductions were done to reduce ongoing labor costs in north america 
this charge was primarily recorded in cost of sales 
in october of  we announced the closing of an emission control manufacturing facility in birmingham  uk approximately employees were eligible for severance benefits in accordance with union contracts and uk legal requirements 
we incurred approximately million in costs related to this action in this action is in addition to the plant closings announced in project genesis in the fourth quarter of in october  we announced a plan to eliminate salaried positions through selected layoffs and an elective early retirement program 
the majority of layoffs were at middle and senior management levels 
as of december   we have incurred million in severance costs 
of this total  million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect to generate savings of approximately million annually from this initiative 
including the above costs  we incurred million in restructuring and restructuring related costs in including the costs incurred in through of million  we have incurred a total of million for activities related to our restructuring initiatives 
we have generated about million of annual savings from project genesis 
approximately million of savings was related to closing the eight facilities  approximately million of savings was related to value mapping and plant arrangement and approximately million of savings was related to relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
there have been no significant deviations from planned savings 
all actions for project genesis have been completed 
under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on december   we were allowed to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to cost reduction initiatives over the to time period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
in february of  our senior credit facility was amended to exclude all remaining cash charges and expenses related to restructuring initiatives started on or before february  as of december   we have excluded million in allowable charges relating to restructuring initiatives previously started 
under our amended facility  we are allowed to exclude up to an additional million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to restructuring activities initiated after february  from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios required under our senior credit facility 
as of december   we have excluded million in allowable charges relating to restructuring initiatives against the million available under the terms of the february amendment to the senior credit facility 
in february  we decided to reduce the work force at certain of our global locations as part of our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
the plan contemplates a reduction in force of approximately employees during the first quarter of we expect to record a pre tax charge of approximately million to million during the first quarter of for severance and other benefits related to these reductions in force  substantially all of which will be paid in cash 
these charges are in addition to other customary quarterly restructuring charges that we may incur during the quarter 
in addition to the announced actions  we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities and expect that we will initiate actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and efficient logistics  distribution and manufacturing footprint for the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will undertake additional restructuring actions 
actions that we take  if any  will require the approval of our board of directors  or its authorized committee 
we plan to conduct any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with workers councils  union representatives and others 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million in compared to million in interest expense for includes million related to the refinancing of our million percent senior subordinated notes due we accomplished this refinancing by issuing new percent senior subordinated notes due in november and using the net proceeds of that issuance  together with cash on hand  to redeem our percent notes 
the percent notes were called for redemption in november and the redemption was completed in december included in the total is a write off of million in debt issuance costs  a premium of million for redeeming the bonds prior to their maturity date  and million in overlapping interest expenses during the time between the issuance of the percent notes and the final redemption of the percent notes 
see more detailed explanations on our debt structure  including our issuance of million of percent senior subordinated notes due in november  prepayments and amendments to our senior credit facility in february  and their impact on our interest expense  in liquidity and capital resources capitalization later in this management s discussion and analysis 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at an annual rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at an annual rate of libor plus an average spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements was percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to approximately percent 
based on the rate in effect through january  and using the current libor as determined under these agreements of approximately percent which remains in effect until july   these swaps are not expected to materially impact our annual interest expense 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million 
on december   we had billion in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through july and million through november  while the remainder is fixed over periods of through included in the million is million of long term debt obligations subject to variable interest rates as a result of our swap agreements 
we also have million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
for further discussion see liquidity and capital resources interest rate risk later in this management s discussion and analysis 
income taxes income taxes were an expense of million in  compared to a benefit of million in included in were benefits of million  including settlements of prior year tax issues and resolution of some tax contingencies with our foreign operations 
including these adjustments the effective tax for was percent 
excluding these adjustments our effective tax rate was percent 
included in were benefits of million  including book to return adjustments  settlements of prior year tax issues and benefits related to previous tax losses in foreign operations 
due to efforts to improve overseas operations  we can now recognize the benefits of these previous tax losses in foreign operations  because it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize them to offset future cash tax payments 
the effective tax rate for including the million benefit was percent 
excluding the million benefit our effective tax rate was percent

critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket customers when title and risk of loss passes to the customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers  which is usually at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers 
in connection with the sale of exhaust systems to certain original equipment manufacturers  we purchase catalytic converters or components thereof substrates on behalf of our customers which are used in the assembled system 
these substrates are included in our inventory and passed through to the customer at our cost  plus a small margin  since we take title to the inventory and are responsible for both the delivery and quality of the finished product 
revenues recognized for substrate sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for our aftermarket customers  we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale 
estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns 
where we have offered product warranty  we also provide for warranty costs 
those estimates are based upon historical experience and upon specific warranty issues as they arise 
while we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs  it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
long term receivables we expense pre production design and development costs incurred for our original equipment customers unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of those costs from the customer 
at december   we had million recorded as a long term receivable from original equipment customers for guaranteed pre production design and development arrangements 
while we believe that the vehicle programs behind these arrangements will enter production  these arrangements allow us to recover our pre production design and development costs in the event that the programs are cancelled or do not reach expected production levels 
we have not experienced any material losses on arrangements where we have a contractual guarantee of reimbursement from our customers 
income taxes we have a us federal tax net operating loss nol carryforward at december   of million  which will expire in varying amounts from to the federal tax effect of that nol is million  and is recorded as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet at december  we also have state nol carryforwards at december  of million  which will expire in varying amounts from to the tax effect of the state nol  net of a valuation allowance  is million and is recorded as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet at december  we estimate  based on available evidence both positive and negative  that it is more likely than not that we will utilize these nols within the prescribed carryforward period 
that estimate is based upon our expectations regarding future taxable income of our us operations and the implementation of available tax planning strategies that accelerate usage of the nol 
circumstances that could change that estimate include future us earnings at lower than expected levels or a majority ownership change as defined in the rules of the us tax law 
if that estimate changed  we would be required to cease recognizing an income tax benefit for any new nol and could be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet 
stock based compensation we utilize the intrinsic value method to account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if our compensation costs for our stock based compensation plans were determined using the fair value method of accounting as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we estimate that our pro forma net income and earnings per share would be lower by less than million or per diluted share for each of the years ended december  and goodwill and other intangible assets we utilize an impairment only approach to value our purchased goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
each year in the fourth quarter  we perform an impairment analysis on the balance of goodwill 
inherent in this calculation is the use of estimates as the fair value of our designated reporting units is based upon the present value of our expected future cash flows 
in addition  our calculation includes our best estimate of our weighted average cost of capital and growth rate 
if the calculation results in a fair value of goodwill which is less than the book value of goodwill  an impairment charge would be recorded in the operating results of the impaired reporting unit 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
we also have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a majority of our domestic employees 
our pension and postretirement health care and life insurance expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience while mortality rates are based upon the general population experience which is not expected to differ materially from our experience 
our approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and foreign plans starts with high quality investment grade bonds adjusted for an incremental yield based on actual historical performance 
this incremental yield adjustment is the result of selecting securities whose yields are higher than the normal bonds that comprise the index 
based on this approach  for we lowered the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension plans to percent  from percent 
the discount rate for postretirement benefits was lowered from approximately percent for to approximately percent for our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns  and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets 
as a result  our estimate of the weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans was lowered from percent for to percent for except in the uk  generally  our pension plans do not require employee contributions 
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable us and foreign government regulations and to make additional payments as funds are available to achieve full funding of the accumulated benefit obligation 
at december   all legal funding requirements had been met 
other postretirement benefit obligations  such as retiree medical  and certain foreign pension plans are not funded 
inventory valuation effective january   we changed our accounting method for valuing inventory for our us based operations from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
as a result  all us inventories are now stated at the lower of cost  determined on a fifo basis  or market 
we elected to change to the fifo method as we believe it is preferable for the following reasons the change will provide better matching of revenue and expenditures and the change will achieve greater consistency in valuing our global inventory 
additionally  we initially adopted lifo as it provided certain us tax benefits which we no longer realize due to our us net operating losses when applied for tax purposes  tax laws require that lifo be applied for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as well 
as a result of the change  we also expect to realize administrative efficiencies 
in accordance with gaap  the change in inventory accounting has been applied by adjusting prior year s financial statements 
the effect of the change in accounting principle as of december   was to increase inventories by million  reduce deferred tax assets by million  and increase retained earnings by million

short term debt  which includes the current portion of long term obligations and borrowings by foreign subsidiaries  as well as any outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  increased by approximately million 
the current portion of long term debt decreased by approximately million and was offset by an million increase in foreign subsidiaries obligations 
borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were zero as of december  and december  the overall decrease in long term debt resulted from million in voluntary payments made on our outstanding long term debt and payments on capital leases in addition to our position on interest rate swaps entered into during april see below for further information on the interest rate swaps 
the year to date decrease in shareholders equity primarily results from million related to the translation of foreign balances into us dollars and an adjustment to additional minimum liability of million as a result of an increase in the accrued benefit obligation related to pensions 
this amount was partially offset by our net income  premium on common stock issued pursuant to benefit plans and other transactions which contributed million to shareholders equity 
while our book equity balance was small at december   it had no effect on our business operations 
we have no debt covenants that are based upon our book equity  and there are no other agreements that are adversely impacted by our relatively low book equity 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview and recent transactions 
our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions 
the arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries  as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries 
we originally entered into this facility in and since that time have periodically requested and received amendments to the facility for various purposes 
in december of  we engaged in a series of transactions that resulted in the full refinancing of the facility  through an amendment and restatement 
in february  we amended the facility  which resulted in reduced interest rates on the term loan b and tranche b letter of credit revolving loan portions of the facility 
we also made a voluntary prepayment of million on the term loan b facility  reducing borrowings to million 
during  we increased the amount of commitments under our revolving credit facility from million to million and reduced the amount of commitments under our tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility from million to million 
as of december   the senior credit facility consisted of a seven year  million term loan b facility maturing in december  a five year  million revolving credit facility maturing in december  and a seven year  million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility maturing in december in june  we issued million of percent senior secured notes 
the notes have a final maturity date of july  in december  we issued an additional million of percent senior secured notes 
we incurred million in fees associated with the issuance of the aggregate million of percent senior secured notes and the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility 
these fees are being amortized over the term of the senior secured notes and the amended and restated senior credit facility 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at an annual rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at an annual rate of libor plus an average spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements was percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to approximately percent 
based on the rate in effect through january  and using the current libor as determined under these agreements of approximately percent which remains in effect until july   these swaps are not expected to materially impact our annual interest expense 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million 
on december   we had billion in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through july and million through november  while the remainder is fixed over periods of through included in the million is million of long term debt obligations subject to variable interest rates as a result of our swap agreements 
we also have million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
in november  we refinanced our million of percent senior subordinated notes maturing in october of with new senior subordinated notes 
the new notes have an interest rate of percent  a maturity date of november  and contain substantially similar terms as the notes refinanced 
premium payments and other fees in connection with the refinancing of these notes totaled approximately million  including a million or price premium over par on the redeemed notes 
the new notes accrued interest from november  with an initial interest payment date of may  these notes are described in more detail below under senior secured and subordinated notes 
in connection with the refinancing of the million in senior subordinated notes we amended the senior credit facility effective november  this amendment allowed us to use up to million in cash on hand to pay redemption premiums and or other fees and costs in connection with the redemption and refinancing of the senior subordinated notes 
in exchange for the amendment  we agreed to pay a small fee to the consenting lenders 
we also incurred approximately million in legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment and the issuance of the new senior subordinated notes 
these amounts were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining terms of the senior subordinated notes and senior credit facility 
our interest expense increased in by million due to the fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of our senior subordinated notes  which includes an expense of million for existing deferred debt issuance costs associated with the percent senior subordinated notes 
in february we amended our senior credit facility to reduce by basis points the interest rate on the term loan b facility and the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility 
in connection with the amendment  we voluntarily prepaid million in principal on the term loan b  reducing the term loan b facility from million to million 
additional provisions of the february amendment to the senior credit facility agreement were as follows i amend the definition of ebitda to exclude all remaining cash charges and expenses related to restructuring initiatives started on or before february   and to exclude up to an additional million in restructuring related expenses announced and taken after february   ii increase permitted investments to million  iii exclude expenses related to the issuance of stock options from the definition of consolidated net income  iv permit us to redeem up to million of senior secured notes after january  subject to certain conditions  v increase our ability to add commitments under the revolving credit facility by million  and vi make other minor modifications 
we incurred approximately million in fees and expenses associated with this amendment  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the agreement 
as a result of the amendment and the voluntary prepayment of million under the term loan b  our term loan b interest expense in was approximately million lower than what it would otherwise have been 
during  we increased the amount of commitments under our revolving credit facility from million to million and reduced the amount of commitments under our tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility from million to million 
this reduction of our tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility was required under the terms of the senior credit facility  as we had increased the amount of our revolving credit facility commitments by more than million 
in october  we further amended our senior credit facility increasing the amount of commitments we may seek under the revolving credit portion of the facility from million to million  along with other technical changes 
we will not be required to reduce the commitments under our tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility should we obtain additional revolving credit commitments 
we have not yet sought any such increased commitments  but may do so when  in our judgment  market conditions are favorable 
senior credit facility forms of credit provided 
following the february voluntary prepayment of million  the term loan b facility is payable as follows million due march   and million due each of june  september and december  the revolving credit facility requires that if any amounts are drawn  they be repaid by december prior to that date  funds may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed under the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty 
letters of credit may be issued under the revolving credit facility 
the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility requires that it be repaid by december we can borrow revolving loans from the million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility and use that facility to support letters of credit 
the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility lenders have deposited million with the administrative agent  who has invested that amount in time deposits 
we do not have an interest in any of the funds on deposit 
when we draw revolving loans under this facility  the loans are funded from the million on deposit with the administrative agent 
when we make repayments  the repayments are redeposited with the administrative agent 
the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will be reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we borrow money under this facility or if we use the facility to make payments for letters of credit 
we will not be liable for any losses to or misappropriation of any i return due to the administrative agent s failure to achieve the return described above or to pay all or any portion of such return to any lender under such facility or ii funds on deposit in such account by such lender other than the obligation to repay funds released from such accounts and provided to us as revolving loans under such facility 
senior credit facility interest rates and fees 
borrowings under the term loan b facility and the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points reduced from basis points in february  or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin of basis points reduced from basis points in february 
there is no cost to us for issuing letters of credit under the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility  however outstanding letters of credit reduce our availability to borrow revolving loans under this portion of the facility 
if a letter of credit issued under this facility is subsequently paid and we do not reimburse the amount paid in full  then a ratable portion of each lender s deposit would be used to fund the letter of credit 
we pay the tranche b lenders a fee which is equal to libor plus basis points reduced from basis points in february 
this fee is offset by the return on the funds deposited with the administrative agent which earn interest at a per annum rate approximately equal to libor 
outstanding revolving loans reduce the funds on deposit with the administrative agent which in turn reduce the earnings of those deposits and effectively increases our interest expense at a per annum rate equal to libor 
the interest margins for borrowings under the term loan b facility and tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will be further reduced by basis points following the end of each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than or at the point our credit ratings are improved to bb or better by standard poor s and are rated at least b by moody s or to ba or better by moody s and are rated at least b by standard poor s 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points reduced from basis points in march and further reduced from basis points in august  or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points reduced from basis points to basis points in august  plus a margin of basis points reduced from basis points in march and further reduced from basis points in august 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility accrue a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate of basis points reduced from basis points in march and further reduced from basis points in august for the pro rata account of the lenders under such facility and a fronting fee for the ratable account of the issuers thereof at a per annum rate in an amount to be agreed upon payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest margins for borrowings and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured at the end of each quarter 
the margin we pay on the revolving credit facility is reduced by basis points following each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than beginning in march since our consolidated leverage ratio was as of march   and as of june   the margin we pay on the revolving credit facility was reduced by basis points in the second quarter of and was further reduced by basis points in the third quarter of we also pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
this commitment fee was reduced by basis points during the third quarter of to basis points as our consolidated leverage ratio was less than senior credit facility other terms and conditions 
the amended and restated senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated cash interest paid  and fixed charge coverage ratio consolidated ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures  divided by consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated 
the financial ratios required under the amended senior credit facility and  the actual ratios we achieved for the four quarters of  are shown in the following tables quarter ended march  june  september  december  req

the senior credit facility agreement also contains restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities  including limitations on i incurring additional liens  ii sale and leaseback transactions except for the permitted transactions as described in the amended agreement  iii liquidations and dissolutions  iv incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees  v capital expenditures  vi dividends limited to no more than million per year  vii mergers and consolidations  and viii prepayments and modifications of subordinated and other debt instruments 
compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants as indicated above and operational restrictions of the facility 
our senior credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade 
senior secured and subordinated notes 
our outstanding debt also includes million of percent senior secured notes due july   in addition to the million of percent senior subordinated notes due november  described above 
we can redeem some or all of the notes at any time after july   in the case of the senior secured notes  and november   in the case of the senior subordinated notes 
if we sell certain of our assets or experience specified kinds of changes in control  we must offer to repurchase the notes 
we are permitted to redeem up to percent of the senior secured notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before july  and up to percent of the senior subordinated notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before november  our senior secured and subordinated notes require that  as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted  our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as calculated on a proforma basis  to be greater than and  respectively 
we have not incurred any of the types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted by the indentures 
the indentures also contain restrictions on our operations  including limitations on i incurring additional indebtedness or liens  ii dividends  iii distributions and stock repurchases  iv investments  v asset sales and vi mergers and consolidations 
subject to limited exceptions  all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and several basis 
in addition  the senior secured notes and related guarantees are secured by second priority liens  subject to specified exceptions  on all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets that secure obligations under our senior credit facility  except that only a portion of the capital stock of our and our subsidiary guarantor s domestic subsidiaries is provided as collateral and no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure the notes or guarantees 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us 
the senior subordinated notes rank junior in right of payment to our senior credit facility and any future senior debt incurred 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures 
accounts receivable securitization 
in addition to our senior credit facility  senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  we also sell some of our accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis in north america and europe 
in north america  we have an accounts receivable securitization program with two commercial banks 
we sell original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program 
we sold accounts receivable under this program of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this program is subject to cancellation prior to its maturity date if we were to i fail to pay interest or principal payments on an amount of indebtedness exceeding million  ii default on the financial covenant ratios under the senior credit facility  or iii fail to maintain certain financial ratios in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program 
in january  this program was renewed for days to january  at a facility size of million 
we also sell some receivables in our european operations to regional banks in europe 
at december   we sold million of accounts receivable in europe down from million at december  the arrangements to sell receivables in europe are not committed and can be cancelled at any time 
if we were not able to sell receivables under either the north american or european securitization programs  our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements may increase 
these accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing  and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
capital requirements 
we believe that cash flows from operations  combined with available borrowing capacity described above  assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement  will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for the following year 
our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they continue to repair vehicles already in service  as well as our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans and offset higher raw material prices 
lower north american vehicle production levels  weakening in the global aftermarket  or a reduction in vehicle production levels in europe  beyond our expectations  could impact our ability to meet our financial covenant ratios 
in the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants  we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs 
these options could include further renegotiations with our senior credit lenders  additional cost reduction or restructuring initiatives  sales of assets or common stock  or other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position 
should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs  we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame 
contractual obligations our remaining required debt principal amortization and payment obligations under lease and certain other financial commitments as of december   are shown in the following table payments due in beyond total millions obligations revolver borrowings senior long term debt long term notes capital leases subordinated long term debt other subsidiary debt short term debt debt and capital lease obligations  operating leases interest payments capital commitments total payments   we principally use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
as a result  we classify any outstanding balances of the revolving credit facilities within our short term debt even though the revolving credit facility has a termination date of december  and the tranche b letter of credit facility revolving loan facility has a termination date of december  if we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our senior credit facility  senior secured notes indenture and senior subordinated debt indenture described above  all amounts under those arrangements could  automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders  become due 
additionally  each of those facilities contains provisions that payment defaults and events that cause  or in some cases permit  acceleration under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility  allowing the acceleration of all amounts due 
we currently expect to maintain compliance with terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future 
included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long term debt 
as our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate interest debt  we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of the future interest payments 
interest on our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes is calculated using the fixed rates of percent and percent  respectively 
interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as basis points plus libor of percent which was the rate at december  we have assumed that libor will remain unchanged for the outlying years 
see capitalization 
in addition we have included the impact of our interest rate swaps entered into in april see interest rate risk below 
we have also included an estimate of expenditures required after december  to complete the facilities and projects authorized at december   in which we have made substantial commitments in connections with facilities 
we have not included purchase obligations as part of our contractual obligations as we generally do not enter into long term agreements with our suppliers 
in addition  the agreements we currently have do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase 
if any commitment is provided  in many cases the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier 
as a result  these purchase obligations fluctuate from year to year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligation 
we have not included material cash requirements for taxes as we are a taxpayer in certain foreign jurisdictions but not in domestic locations 
additionally  it is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant impact on future tax payments 
we have also not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement benefit costs 
based upon current estimates we believe we will be required to make contributions of approximately million to those plans in pension and postretirement contributions beyond will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors  including the performance of our pension fund investments during in addition  we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation 
based upon current estimates we believe we will be required to spend approximately million over the next to years 
however  due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors  it is difficult to determine the actual timing of the payments 
see environmental and other matters 
we occasionally provide guarantees that could require us to make future payments in the event that the third party primary obligor does not make its required payments 
we have not recorded a liability for any of these guarantees 
the only third party guarantee we have made is the performance of lease obligations by a former affiliate 
our maximum liability under this guarantee was approximately million at both december  and  respectively 
we have no recourse in the event of default by the former affiliate 
however  we have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee 
additionally  we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries  and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt 
all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior credit facility  our senior secured notes and our senior subordinated notes on a joint and several basis 
the arrangement for the senior credit facility is also secured by first priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries 
the arrangement for the million senior secured notes is also secured by second priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets  excluding some of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries 
no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure these notes 
you should also read note where we present the supplemental guarantor condensed consolidating financial statements 
we have issued guarantees through letters of credit in connection with some obligations of our affiliates 
we have guaranteed through letters of credit support for local credit facilities  and cash management requirements for some of our subsidiaries totaling million 
we have also issued million in letters of credit to support some of our subsidiaries insurance arrangements 
in addition  we have issued million in guarantees through letters of credit to guarantee other obligations of subsidiaries primarily related to environmental remediation activities 
dividends on common stock on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows years ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the year ended december   cash flow provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in the prior year 
for cash used for working capital was million compared to a cash flow provided of million for higher revenues and the discontinuation of the advance payment programs with three major oe customers in north america were the primary reasons for higher year over year receivables balances that resulted in cash outflow of million  a million increase from last year 
inventory reductions provided cash of million compared to a use of cash of million in the prior year 
accounts payable provided cash of million versus last years cash inflow of million 
cash interest payments of million in were significantly lower than prior year payments of million as a result of refinancing transactions in this was partially offset by higher cash tax payments of million in compared to million in other operating activity was a use of million in cash for  compared to a cash inflow of million in the prior year 
this change was primarily related to an increase in pension contributions during we had arrangements with three major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million as of december  all three of these programs were discontinued during to mitigate the impact on our liquidity from the termination of these programs  in we supplemented our existing senior credit facility by increasing from million to million the amount of lenders commitments under the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit facility 
as part of this agreement  we reduced from million to million the amount of lenders commitments under the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility portion of the senior credit facility 
in october  we further supplemented the senior credit facility by increasing from million to million the amount of commitments we may seek 
we have not yet sought any such additional commitments 
we were not required to reduce the commitments under the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility in connection with the october amendment 
one of our european subsidiaries receives payment from one of its oe customers whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the delivery of negotiable financial instruments 
we may collect these financial instruments before their maturity date by either selling them at a discount or using them to satisfy accounts receivable that have previously been sold to a european bank 
the reported sales of these financial instruments were no longer included in the account receivables sold beginning in the fourth quarter of any of these financial instruments which were not sold are classified as other current assets as they do not meet our definition of cash equivalents 
the amount of these financial instruments that were collected before their maturity date totaled million at december   compared with million at december  in certain instances several of our chinese subsidiaries receive payment from oe customers and satisfy vendor payments through the receipt and delivery of negotiable financial instruments 
financial instruments used to satisfy vendor payables and not redeemed totaled million at december  and were classified as notes payable 
financial instruments received from oe customers and not redeemed totaled million at december  and were classified as other current assets 
one of our chinese subsidiaries is required to maintain a cash balance at a financial institution issuing the financial instruments which are used to satisfy vendor payments 
the balance totaled million at december  and was classified as cash and cash equivalents 
investing activities cash used for investing activities was million higher in compared to the same period a year ago 
in we used million in cash to acquire the exhaust operations of gabilan manufacturing and million to acquire the remaining minority interest in india s hydraulics joint venture operations  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of million 
in we received million in cash from the sale of assets  primarily driven by the sale of our birmingham  uk facility 
expenditures for plant  property and equipment were in versus million in the increase of million in expenditures for plant  property and equipment was primarily due to the timing of future oe customer platform launches 
expenditures for software related intangible assets were million in compared to million in financing activities cash flow from financing activities was a million outflow in compared to an outflow of million in the same period of the primary reason for the change is attributable to million in cash used to reduce our long term debt during outlook north american oe light vehicle production levels for were million units  even with current estimates for are that north american oe light vehicle production levels will remain flat with however  we remain cautious about the outlook for north american production rates due to volatile oil prices and the overall financial condition of original equipment manufacturers  especially ford and general motors who have announced job cuts  plant closings  and other restructuring activities 
we are also uncertain about the willingness of the original equipment manufacturers to continue to support consumer vehicle sales through incentives 
we believe that new product launches  our position on top selling platforms  increasing market positions with toyota  honda and nissan  and a strong new product and technology pipeline will help us to offset pressures from north american production rates 
european light vehicle production volumes were million units during and expectations for indicate production increases slightly to million units 
we saw a strong increase in heavy duty truck production rates during production rates for are expected to remain at the same levels as  primarily due to the pull forward of production to avoid the introduction of stricter emission regulations in in the global aftermarket  issues that have impacted revenues in the past will likely continue to be a challenge in heightened competition in the european aftermarket and longer product replacement cycles are expected to continue their impact on volumes 
we saw signs of sales stabilization in the north america aftermarket exhaust business unit during  and we are cautiously optimistic that these conditions will continue in we also plan to continue our efforts to increase new and existing sales in the north american aftermarket ride control business unit 
in addition  we are pursuing other aftermarket opportunities with the introduction of filters in europe and brakes in both europe and north america 
tenneco estimates that its global original equipment revenues will be approximately billion in and billion in adjusted for lower margin substrate sales  the company s global original equipment revenues are estimated to be approximately billion in and billion in these revenue estimates are based on original equipment manufacturers programs that have been formally awarded to the company  programs where the company is highly confident that it will be awarded business based on informal customer indications consistent with past practices  tenneco s status as supplier for the existing program and its relationship with the customer  and the actual original equipment revenues achieved by the company for each of the last several years compared to the amount of those revenues that the company estimated it would generate at the beginning of each year 
our revenue estimate is subject to increase or decrease due to changes in customer requirements  customer and consumer preferences  and the number of vehicles actually produced by our customers 
we do not intend  however  to update the amounts shown above due to these changes 
in addition  our revenue estimate is based on our anticipated pricing for each applicable program over its life 
however  we are under continuing pricing pressures from our oe customers 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above for any price changes 
finally  for our foreign operations  our revenue estimate assumes a fixed foreign currency value 
this value is used to translate foreign business to the us dollar 
currency in our foreign operations is subject to fluctuation based on the economic conditions in each of our foreign operations 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above due to these fluctuations 
see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and item a  risk factors 
raw material prices  and in particular steel prices  continue to be a concern with continued pressure on prices expected into the foreseeable future 
we worked hard in and continue to work hard to address this issue by evaluating alternative materials and processes  reviewing material substitution opportunities  increasing component and assembly outsourcing to low cost countries and aggressively pursuing recovery of higher costs from our customers 
in addition to these actions  we continue to pursue productivity initiatives and review opportunities to reduce costs through six sigma  lean manufacturing and restructuring activities 
we will continue to focus on controlling costs and leveraging global supply chain spending 
environmental and other matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations 
we expense expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
we record liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
we consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  other companies cleanup experiences and data released by the united states environmental protection agency or other organizations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information 
where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable  we have discounted the liabilities 
all other environmental liabilities are recorded at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and  when they are assured  recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
as of december   we are designated as a potentially responsible party in one superfund site 
we have estimated our share of the remediation costs for this site to be close to zero 
in addition to the superfund site  we may have the obligation to remediate current or former facilities  and we estimate our share of remediation costs at these facilities to be approximately million 
for the superfund site and the current and former facilities  we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs 
although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information  the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required 
at some sites  we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs 
in addition  at the superfund site  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that our liability could be joint and several  meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund site  and of other liable parties at our current and former facilities  has been considered  where appropriate  in our determination of our estimated liability 
we believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the superfund site  or as a liable party at our current or former facilities  will not be material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
from time to time we are subject to product warranty claims whereby we are required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products 
warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field 
we believe that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the reserve 
the reserve is included in short term on the balance sheet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item for information regarding our warranty reserves 
we also from time to time are involved in legal proceedings  claims or investigations that are incidental to the conduct of our business 
some of these proceedings allege damages against us relating to environmental liabilities including toxic tort  property damage and remediation  intellectual property matters including patent  trademark and copyright infringement  and licensing disputes  personal injury claims including injuries due to product failure  design or warnings issues  and other product liability related matters  taxes  employment matters  and commercial or contractual disputes  sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures 
for example  one of our chinese joint ventures is currently under investigation by local customs officials related to whether the joint venture applied the proper tariff code to certain of its imports 
we vigorously defend ourselves against all of these claims 
in future periods  we could be subjected to cash costs or non cash charges to earnings if any of these matters is resolved on unfavorable terms 
however  although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  based on present information  including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim  we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants 
however  only a small percentage of these claimants allege that they were automobile mechanics who were allegedly exposed to our former muffler products and a significant number appear to involve workers in other industries or otherwise do not include sufficient information to determine whether there is any basis for a claim against us 
we believe  based on scientific and other evidence  it is unlikely that mechanics were exposed to asbestos by our former muffler products and that  in any event  they would not be at increased risk of asbestos related disease based on their work with these products 
further  many of these cases involve numerous defendants  with the number of each in some cases exceeding defendants from a variety of industries 
additionally  the plaintiffs either do not specify any  or specify the jurisdictional minimum  dollar amount for damages 
as major asbestos manufacturers continue to go out of business or file for bankruptcy  we may experience an increased number of these claims 
we vigorously defend ourselves against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business 
in future periods  we could be subject to cash costs or non cash charges to earnings if any of these matters is resolved unfavorably to us 
to date  with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process  we have regularly achieved favorable resolution in the form of a dismissal of the claim or a judgment in our favor 
accordingly  we presently believe that these asbestos related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
employee stock ownership plans we have established employee stock ownership plans for the benefit of our employees 
under the plans  subject to limitations in the internal revenue code  participants may elect to defer up to percent of their salary through contributions to the plan  which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock 
we currently match in cash percent of each employee s contribution up to eight percent of the employee s salary 
we recorded expense for these matching contributions of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and  respectively 
all contributions vest immediately 
derivative financial instruments foreign currency exchange rate risk we use derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third party trade receivables and payables 
we manage counter party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
we have from time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts  weighted average settlement rates  and fair value for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of december  all contracts in the following table mature in december  notional amount weighted average fair value in in foreign currency settlement rates us dollars millions except settlement rates australian dollars purchase

interest rate risk our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities 
we primarily use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
we pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings 
we have financed our long term capital requirements with long term debt with original maturity dates ranging from five to ten years 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at an annual rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at an annual rate of libor plus an average spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements was percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to approximately percent 
based on the rate in effect through january  and using the current libor as determined under these agreements of approximately percent which remains in effect until july   these swaps are not expected to materially impact our annual interest expense 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million 
on december   we had billion in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through july and million through november  while the remainder is fixed over periods of through included in the million is million of long term debt obligations subject to variable interest rates as a result of our swap agreements 
we also have million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
we estimate that the fair value of our long term debt at december  was about percent of its book value 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about million after tax  excluding the effect of the interest rate swaps we completed in april a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the swaps we completed in april would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately million after tax
