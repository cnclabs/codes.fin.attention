item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these e stimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note g to the consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  will satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note g 
as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and remedy of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
subject to the difficulty in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts recorded is remote 
however  any changes  including regulatory changes  may require the company to reco rd additional remediation reserves 
as noted in notes b and o to the consolidated financial statements  the company has recorded asset impairment charges under sfas in and including a  charge in as part of the loss recognized for discontinued operations 
based on assessments performed in on the continuing assets of the company  which indicated no write downs were deemed necessary  the company believes that it is unlikely that these types of impairment charges will continue to occur 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicate values for the related long lived assets are less than the carrying values of those assets  additional impairment charges may be necessary 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operations during totaled   provided by continuing operations and  provided by discontinued operations 
this compares to cash flows provided by operations in totaling   provided by discontinued operations offset by  used in continuing operations 
as a result  cash flows from continuing operations increased  from the amount 
inventories declined  in after increasing  in throughout  the metals segment experienced raw material cost increases  primarily in the form of surcharges on stainless steel purchases and had on hand a higher than normal amount of inventory units at year end causing the significant increase in the increases in raw material costs continued through the first six months of  then stabilized over the last six months 
in addition  the segment completed a planned reduction in of inventory units to a more acceptable level which resulted in the net reduction in inventory dollars at year end 
accounts receivable increased  in compared to increasing  in the increases came primarily from the significant improvement in sales experienced in both  up percent  and  up percent  over prior year amounts  as both operating segments responded t o rising raw material and operating costs with higher selling prices  coupled to a lesser extent by selling more unit volumes 
accounts payable increased  in compared to an increase of  in the increase came primarily from increases in the costs of raw materials discussed above combined with the timing of receipt and payment of stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment in compared to cash flows were also generated by the receipt of  from the anti dumping settlement of which  was paid out in january  discussed in the results of operations below 
accrued income taxes of  accrued against earnings increased  in which the company expects to pay in the first quarter of finally  cash flows were positively impacted by net income from continuing operations of  before depreciation and amortization expense of  compared to  generated in the cash flows provided by disconti nued operations were derived from declines in accounts receivable and inventories offset by a decrease in accounts payable totaling   and  respectively 
the cash flows were generated from the liquidation of the net assets realted to the sale of the company s dye business at the end of as discussed in the discontinued operations discussion below 
the net effect of the items described above was to increase current liabilities by  which also caused working capital for to decrease by  to  from the amount in  of which  of the decrease came from discontinued operations 
the current ratio for the year ended december   also declined to from the year end ratio of in based on the payment dates of many of the liabilities described above  the company expects to utilize its revolving line of credit during the first quarter of to provide funds for payment of the liabilities which should bring the working capital level and current ratio more in line with historical levels while increasing the amount of long term debt outstanding 
the company utilized the cash flows generated in to pay down its debt by  and fund capital expenditures of  the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments and fund estimated capital expenditures of  and normal operating requirements 
on december   the company entered into a credit agreement with a lender to provide a  line of credit expiring on december   and refinanced the company s existing bank indebtedness 
the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of  which includes a  sub limit for swing line loans requiring additional pre approval by the bank  and a five year  term loan requiring equal quarterly payments of  with a balloon payment at the expiration date 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to a borrowing base calculation including eligible accounts receivable  inventories  and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance as defined in the agreement 
as of december   the amount available for borrowing was  of which  was borrowed leaving  of availability 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants which include  among others  maintaining certain ebitda  fixed charge and tangible net worth amounts

consolidated operating results for were significantly impacted by several transactions that were recorded during the fourth quarter 
in december of  the company  along with several other domestic stainless steel pipe producers  received funds from the settlement of an anti dumping duty order against a foreign producer and importer of stainless steel pipe issued under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act 
the order covered the period from june  to november  as a result the company recorded a gain of  the company s op subsidiary has an  note receivable from an affiliated company in which op owns percent 
the affiliated company has as its primary asset a minority investment in a chinese pigment plant under a joint venture agreement that expires in from which op purchases some of its raw materials 
the joint venture had been profitable since  but is expected to report an operating loss for and has indicated that market and operating conditions are not expected to improve and it is anticipating incurring losses going forward 
based on the current and anticipated operating losses of the joint venture and other factors the company was able to ascertain  the likelihood that the affiliated company will be able to repay the note receivable is unlikely 
the receivable was written off at december  and the  loss was included in other expense

amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income loss year end backlogs piping systems comparison of to metals segment the metals segment accomplished noteworthy sales growth of percent for the year and percent for the fourth quarter of compared to a year earlier 
the increases resulted from a combination of percent and three percent higher average selling prices and one percent and percent higher unit volumes for the year and fourth quarter  respectively 
gross profit for the segment improved  or percent  and remained basically unchanged at percent of sales for compared to percent in in the fourth quarter of compared to  gross profit increased  or nine percent  but decreased percent of sales to percent from the fourth quarter of during the first six months of  surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased steadily and the segment was able to increase selling prices to pass on the increased costs 
because of the steadily increasing raw material costs and selling prices experienced throughout and the first half of  the segment generated higher profits from selling lower cost inventories 
however  because raw material costs and selling prices stabilized in the second half of  the profits realized from this source in the third and fourth quarters of were substantially less than profits realized in as well as the first two quarters of the significant increase in unit volume experienced in the fourth quarter came primarily from commodity pipe sales as management focused on improving its market share of commodity pipe 
this change in product mix to a higher level of commodity pipe also contributed to the lower margins experienced in the fourth quarter of sales of higher margin specialty alloy pipe improved steadily throughout as unit volumes increased over the same quarter of the prior year for six consecutive quarters starting in the third quarter of in addition  piping systems benefited from its strong backlog as sales and profitability increased each quarter in compared to the preceding quarter 
selling and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  but declined to five percent of sales in compared to seven percent of sales in the increase in dollars came primarily from increases in profit based incentives  sales commissions from increased sales  and an increase in general insurance expense 
as a result of all of the factors listed above  the segment experienced significant sales and profit improvement for the year compared to  as the segment achieved a percent increase in operating income for and a seven percent increase in the fourth quarter compared to the same periods in comparison of to metals segment dollar sales increased percent for the year and percent for the fourth quarter of from the same periods of the increase for resulted from percent higher average selling prices partially offset by seven percent lower unit volumes 
the increase for the fourth quarter of resulted from percent higher average selling prices offset by percent lower unit volumes 
surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased throughout the year increasing from an average of about 
per pound in december to an average of about 
per pound in december the segment was able to pass through most of these cost increases  which accounted for most of the increase in selling prices  and benefited throughout from selling price increases implemented to offset the continued increases in surcharges included in raw material costs 
because of the steadily increasing raw material and selling prices experienced throughout  the segment generated higher profits from selling lower cost inventories  which contributed to the significant gross profit improvement experienced for the year and fourth quarter or compared to the same periods of the most noteworthy accomplishment in the segment s pipe business in was a percent increase in special alloy sales which rose to percent of pipe sales 
as of  this was the highest level ever achieved and was the result of the segment s focus on developing more non commodity pipe business where profit margins are higher 
although the piping systems business had a loss for  after experiencing three consecutive quarters of losses in  piping systems generated an operating profit for the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter was the first one in where customers scheduling requirements allowed piping systems to get a sufficient amount of work into the shop to enable the operation to operate profitably for the quarter 
piping systems backlog ended the year at  compared to a   backlog at the end of selling and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  but remained at seven percent of sales 
the increase in dollars came primarily from increases in profit based incentives  sales commissions from increased sales  and bad debt expense 
the company increased its reserves for bad debts to offset exposure from the higher level of accounts receivable consistent with the increase in sales activity experienced through specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note p to the consolidated financial statements 
amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense long lived asset impairment cost operating income loss comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment produced strong sales growth of percent and percent for the year and fourth quarter of  respectively 
gross profit for the segment improved  or two percent  but decreased as a percent of sales percent to percent from s percentage 
in the fourth quarter of compared to  gross profit increased  or percent  and decreased as a percent of sales percent to percent from the fourth quarter of the segment experienced favorable business conditions throughout as demand for its products remained strong 
the profit improvement for the year did not keep pace with the sales growth because of increased raw material and operating costs coming primarily from the increase in crude oil prices negatively impacting oil based raw material costs and utility and transportation costs 
although the segment implemented selling price increases throughout the year  it was unable to increase prices consistent wi th the increases in manufacturing costs which caused an erosion of gross profits 
also impacting profitability was the effect of changes in product mix and expenses  including contract tolling  at the spartanburg plant related to new products and upgrading of the staff in expectation of higher production levels in the spartanburg location lost a high margin tolling contract in that also hurt profitability at the plant 
although the segment was able to add several new contracts in spartanburg during the fourth quarter of  they were not placed in production long enough to offset the lost profits 
selling and administrative expense remained relatively flat in compared to  and declined as a percent of sales to nine percent in compared to ten percent in resulting from management s efforts to maintain an even level of sales and administrative expense to offset the higher manufacturing costs the segment is experiencing 
management was pleased with the overall performance of the segment  considering the negative impact of steadily rising raw material and operating costs experienced throughout  as operating income increased slightly to  and  for the year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to  and  for the same periods of comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales were up  or percent  gross profits increased  or percent  and operating income was  compared to a loss of  in compared to  respectively 
favorable market conditions for most of the segments products and new product development at the spartanburg location accounted for the increase in sales 
the percent increase in gross profits in compared to resulted from improved profitability at all three of the chemical plants  and from a  inventory charge in at the greensboro plant discussed below 
unlike  the segment was able to pass some of the higher operating costs during  especially energy costs  to its customers which allowed the segment to generate additional margin contribution from the increased sales volume 
for the fourth quarter of  sales were up  or percent and gross profits increased  or percent compared to fourth quarter operating income was  compared to a loss of  in the fourth quarter of the modest level of profitability i n the fourth quarter of was caused primarily by poor results at the spartanburg plant because of the low level of contract campaigns 
this location has often had volatility in its production levels quarter to quarter because of the customers scheduling requirements 
included in operating income in the fourth quarter of were a  inventory charge and a  impairment loss 
the segment s pigment business located in greensboro  north carolina  experienced a significant downturn in textile business during the last six months of incurring losses during that period 
although the non textile portion of the pigment business was growing  it was not expanding fast enough to offset the declining textile business 
the reduced volume did not produce sufficient contribution margin to offset operating costs causing the losses 
as a result of lost business  mainly from customers closing their operations  the location accumulated excessive inventories with few or no customers available to systemati cally sell off and or blend off the inventory 
as a result  a  inventory charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of also during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an impairment assessment on the plant and equipment located at greensboro and based on the results of the assessment  recorded a  impairment loss 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expense declined  in compared to  and declined as a percent of sales to ten percent in compared to percent in the decline came primarily from reduced bad debt expense at op caused by the need to increase bad debt reserves in to account for several customer bankruptcies 
for information related to environmental matters  see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations on july  the company purchased certain assets of rite industries 
these assets along with synalloy s existing textile dye business were placed in a newly formed subsidiary of the company called blackman uhler  llc bu colors of which percent was owned by the company 
the acquisition provided a new customer base in the paper and other non textile industries 
total cost of the acquisition was  and the company funded the acquisition with available cash 
as a result of the continuing downward trends in the textile industry and poor financial performance of the textile dye business  the company decided at the end of the fourth quarter of to divest the liquid dye portion of its dye business servicing the textile industry  and began downsizing the remaining dye business 
in the fourth quarter of  a  inventory charge was recorded to cost of goods sold to write down inventories related to the liquid dye product lines 
on march   the company entered into an agreement to sell the liquid dye business composed of vat  sulfur  liquid disperse and liquid reactive dyes with annual sales of approximately  for approximately its net book value  and several customers and related products of the remaining textile dye business were rationalized 
business conditions in the remaining dye business were poor throughout  especially in the first six months  as bu colors experienced operating losses in every quarter of in the third quarter of  the company decided to attempt to sell the remaining dye business and on december   entered into a purchase agreement to sell the dye business 
the transaction closed on january  the terms included the sale of the inventory of bu colors along with certain equipment and other property associated with the business being sold  and the licensing of certain intellectual property  for a purchase price of approximately  of which  was paid at closing  and the balance of  was to be paid over time based on the operations of the purchaser 
on january   the company and the purchaser amended the purchase agreement replacing the periodic purchase price payments for a one time payment of  which was received on january   and was reclassified to a current note receivable in the financial statements at december  as a result of the sale of the dye business in  the company has discontinued the operations of bu colors and has presented the financial information of bu colors as discontinued operations  including restating in december of  the company completed an impairment assessment in accordance with fas no 
 on the plant and equipment located at the spartanburg facility related to the bu colors operations 
as a result  the company recognized an impairment loss of  from the write down of plant and equipment 
reference should be made to notes b and o to the consolidated financial statements 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note p to the consolidated financial statements for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense increased  or percent  to  for compared to the increase resulted primarily from environmental expenses of  compared to  in  which includes accruing environmental remediation costs of  at the spartanburg facility and  at the augusta facility  closed in reference should be made to note g to the consolidated financial statements 
also contributing to the increase were increased professional fees and general insurance expenses 
interest expense in decreased  in from from decreases in borrowings offset by increases in the prime interest rate under the lines of credit with a lender 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense increased  or percent  to  for compared to the increase resulted primarily from the addition of environmental expenses of  to accrue for  of environmental remediation costs in the fourth quarter of at the spartanburg facility and from the recording of a  environmental charge in the second quarter of to reflect the settlement with the environmental protection agency of the company s obligation as a potentially responsible party in the clean up of a waste disposal site 
reference should be made to note g to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in increased  in from from increases in borrowings and the prime interest rate under the lines of credit with a lender 
current conditions and outlook in the metals segment  piping systems backlog continues at an excellent level  totaling  at the end of which is up percent over the year earlier backlog of  and is expected to be completed in a significant amount of the increase came from an lng project to be completed over the first half of piping systems backlog should continue to provide a level of sales for piping systems to operate profitably over the next several quarters 
specialty alloy sales continue to be strong and management remains optimistic about the current conditions that exist in the specialty alloy markets 
the segment has been successful in penetrating new markets  such as projects in the lng and waste water industries  where management believes there is significant growth potential 
if piping systems can continue to generate sufficient volume through its operations  and demand for commodity and special alloy piping continue at their current leve ls  management believes this segment will continue to operate profitably 
in the specialty chemicals segment  management is focusing on increasing sales volumes at the spartanburg location and is anticipating adding new products throughout included in this effort is a new line of fire retardant chemicals 
sales order activity for fire retardant products has increased steadily over to a variety of customers 
applications for this new line of chemicals include mattresses  furniture and home appliances  which are subject to federal fire retardant regulations that will be implemented on july  regulations already exist in california requiring mattress manufacturers to utilize fire retardant products that conform to the new regulations in their production process beginning on january  qualifications of the segment s products continue to have good success in each of the applications 
in addition  these products offer a cost effective and safer alternative than certain compounds used in products currently servicing t hese industries 
based on the positive test results these products continue to achieve  management expects the demand for fire retardant products to continue to increase and grow into significant volumes by the end of the segment moved op s operations from greensboro  nc to spartanburg in the first quarter of the greensboro plant has been closed and the company has entered into a contract to sell the property which is expected to close in april of management is not expecting to record any loss from the move as the anticipated profit from the sale of the property is expected to cover the cost of the move 
consolidating the two operations will provide operating efficiencies including lower operating costs  and coupled with the expected proprietary product growth  should reduce the spartanburg plant s dependence on contract processing and reduce the volatility of its operating results 
assuming that management is successful in developing new business opportunities  including the proprietary pr oducts in its spartanburg location  and that no significant downturn in the general economy occurs  management expects this segment to continue its growth 
excellent cash flow of  from operating activities and discontinued operations made it possible to finance the increased level of business activity while reducing debt by  during the company ended the year in a very strong financial position  with debt equal to only percent of capitalization debt plus equity 
the company is well positioned to finance the growth that management is focused on achieving 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
in this regard  changes in u 
s 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company s debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of at december   under a  line of credit expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
at january   under a  line of credit expiring july  with an average variable interest rate of percent 
the company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
cash flow and fair value hedges are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets  liabilities and certain types of firm commitments 
the company s objective in using these instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows from interest rate risks on its long term indebtedness and fluctuations in the fair value of commodities used in the company s stainless steel raw materials 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the company specifically identifies the asset  liability and non cancelable commitment that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to that item 
the company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a he dged item  when the derivative expires  when it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  when a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or when management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
cash flow hedges are hedges that use simple derivatives to offset the variability of expected future cash flows 
variability can appear in floating rate liabilities and can arise from changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap in which it pays a fixed rate of interest while receiving a variable rate of interest to change the cash flow profile of its variable rate borrowing to match a fixed rate profile 
the company then designates this swap as a cash flow hedge of the associated variable rate borrowing 
as discussed in note e to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a long term debt agreement with its bank and pays interest based on a variable interest rate 
to mitigate the variability of the interest rate risk  the company entered into a hedge contract in february of with the bank  coupled with a third party who will pay a variable rate of interest an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is for  with a fixed interes t rate of percent  and runs from march  to december   which equates to the final payment amount and due date of the term loan 
the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the associated variable rate borrowing 
if  as expected  the derivative is perfectly effective in offsetting variable interest in the borrowing  changes in its fair value will be recorded in a separate component in equity  and then released to earnings contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the term loan 
in the ordinary course of business  the company s income and cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in the price of nickel which is a component of stainless steel raw materials used in its production of stainless steel pipe 
the company is subject to raw material surcharges on the nickel component from its stainless steel suppliers 
for certain non cancelable fixed price sales contracts having delivery dates in the future  the company is not able to obtain fixed price purchase commitments to cover the nickel surcharge component of the stainless steel raw material requirements of the sales contract creating a cost exposure from fluctuations in the nickel surcharges 
where such exposure exists  the company considers the use of cash settled commodity price swaps with durations approximately equal to the expected delivery dates of the applicable raw materials to hedge the price of its nickel requirements 
the company designates these instruments as fair value hedges and the resulting chang es in their fair value are recorded as inventory costs 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
while these hedging activities may protect the company against higher nickel prices  they may also prevent realizing possible lower raw material costs in the event that the market price of nickel falls below the price stated in a forward sale or futures contract 
there were no outstanding hedging contracts at december
