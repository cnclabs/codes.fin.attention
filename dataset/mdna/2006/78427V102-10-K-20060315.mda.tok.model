the transaction was funded through cash on hand  a subordinated seller s note in the amount of million  and borrowing from our newly amended credit facility  which is described below 
we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings 
zen s trailing twelve months revenue ended november   was approximately million unaudited 
amendment to credit facility 
on february   contemporaneously with our closing the acquisition of zen  we entered into a first amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement  or first amendment  with a syndicate of lenders  including wachovia bank  national association  a national banking association  which acted as administrative agent for the lenders

overview we are a provider of mission critical information technology and network solutions primarily to the federal government 
our business is guided by our experienced team of eight executive officers and over twenty five other corporate officers who manage and are responsible for successfully growing our business 
as of the end of fiscal year  we employed over  employees 
approximately of our employees hold federal government security clearances or have passed national agency checks 
approximately of our employees hold top secret security clearances 
a significant portion of our employees who hold top secret security clearances also hold sensitive compartmental information clearances  which permit us to bid on highly classified projects 
our broad set of contract vehicles gives us extensive reach and enables us to deliver a full range of our services and solutions to the federal government 
the strength of our service offerings and information technology expertise allows us to maintain substantial relationships with clients  some of whom have been clients of ours  or of one of our acquired businesses  for over years 
in fiscal and fiscal  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenue from contracts on which we acted as prime contractor 
acting as a prime contractor provides us with stronger client relationships  as well as the visibility and access to new work that are not available when acting as a subcontractor 
our total backlog as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was funded 
see backlog for a discussion of how we calculate backlog 
the federal government technology services market the ongoing transformation of the federal government s information systems and communication networks is creating an increase in its demand for information technology  or it  services 
according to input  an independent market research firm  the federal market demand for vendor furnished information systems and services is projected to increase by billion from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
in addition  the addressable it spending  which is the amount that is contracted out  for the us air force  our single largest client in terms of revenue for each of the last four completed fiscal years  is projected by input to grow from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  representing a compounded annual growth rate of 
the department of homeland security addressable portion of the it budget is projected by input to grow from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  representing a compounded annual growth rate of 
spending for federal it requested by the us office of management and budget omb in government fiscal shows an increase of over the government fiscal request  according to input 
we expect that the federal government s need for the types of it services that we provide will continue to grow in the foreseeable future  as a result of the high priority placed by the federal government on the transformation of its it programs 
input forecasts that the percentage of it spending that is contracted out by the federal government will reach a high of of total it spending in government fiscal according to input  the government fiscal it budget request of over the enacted government fiscal budget  at a time when the request for overall federal spending was nearly flat  demonstrated the importance the administration places on it as an integral part of federal business processes 
we believe the following industry trends will also continue to drive the federal government technology services market continued focus on mission critical initiatives 
since the events of september   the federal government has made the transformation of its it infrastructure a major priority 
according to input  the federal government it services commercial segment  which is comprised of outsourcing  professional services  systems integration and processing services  is projected to grow from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  representing a projected compounded annual growth rate of 
according to input  growth in the commercial segment for the us air force is projected to rise from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal year  a compounded annual growth rate of 
increased federal government reliance on outsourcing 
according to input  outsourcing through the use of outside providers to provide federal government services is projected to grow from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  representing a projected compounded annual growth rate of 
we believe that the federal government is increasingly turning to the it industry to execute support processes and functions that were traditionally performed by federal government employees 
input expects that department of defense dod budgets will continue to grow over the next several governmental fiscal years and anticipates that each of the defense agencies will move toward outsourcing more of the information technology functions that are not core to the war fighting mission 
business process outsourcing  or bpo  is a relationship in which a contractor is responsible for performing an entire business operations function  including the information systems outsourcing that supports it 
input projects that federal government bpo spending will grow from million in government fiscal to million in government fiscal in  which represents a compounded annual growth rate of 
in addition  during this same period  input projects a compounded annual growth rate for bpo spending by defense agencies of 
according to input  the size of the federal government workforce  which includes only civilian employees and non uniform military personnel in federal civilian agencies and the dod  decreased by million workers during the period through  representing a decline 
we believe that homeland security will have the greatest impact on three specific segments of the federal government it market information security  communications and knowledge management 
we believe that the rapid pace of technological innovations and the federal government s increasing reliance on complex it infrastructure  combined with a decline in the size of the federal government workforce  as described above  make it increasingly difficult for many governmental agencies to operate and upgrade their it systems 
we expect that several trends will contribute to the federal government s increased use of service providers to fulfill a larger portion of its iit responsibilities  and we believe that we will continue to gain new engagements to the extent that the federal government increases its reliance on outsourcing for its it needs 
these trends include the aging of the federal government s workforce 
according to input  the government has estimated that more than of federal it workers will be eligible for retirement by  and the average age of federal government employees increased from years of age in to years of age in in april  the gao concluded in a report that the federal government s human capital challenges are adversely affecting the ability of many agencies to carry out their missions 
increased federal government emphasis on competitive sourcing 
the current administration has made competitive sourcing a major initiative of its management agenda 
according to the president s management agenda  which was issued in and for which progress reports continue to be issued  including most recently during  nearly half of all federal government employees perform tasks that are available in the commercial marketplace 
to the extent that the size of the federal government workforce decreases  we believe that the federal government will have an increased need for entities that offer the technical skills  familiarity with government processes and procedures and skilled personnel that are necessary to meet the diverse it requirements of the various federal government agencies 
increased spending on homeland security and intelligence 
in the wake of the terrorist attacks on september   there has been an increased emphasis on homeland security  intelligence and national defense  including protecting critical infrastructure 
according to input  the total addressable it budget for the department of homeland security is projected to grow from billion in government fiscal to billion in government fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
although the total amount to be spent for intelligence applications is classified  based on available information  input has forecasted that the addressable federal government it spending in the intelligence community may be as much as billion in government fiscal we believe that there will continue to be increases in spending on federal intelligence activities  which are expected to represent significant additional opportunities for us 
increased simplicity of procurement 
through changes that began with the federal acquisition streamlining act of  or fasa  the federal government has developed a variety of accelerated contracting methods 
federal governmental agencies have increasingly been able to rely on multiple contracting vehicles to procure needed services in an expedient manner 
according to input  the average time to procure products and services was approximately days in government fiscal as compared to days in government fiscal our core strengths we strategically built our business to respond specifically to the federal it marketplace 
we believe that our core strengths position us to respond to the long term trends and changing demands of our market

clients we provide our services primarily to federal government clients such as the us air force space command  the us army  us navy  the department of state  the department of homeland security  department of agriculture  national institutes of health  federal retirement thrift investment board  and the defense intelligence community 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our total revenue from federal governmental agencies and approximately of our total revenue from commercial clients 
our largest client is the dod 
we derived approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and approximately of our total revenue in fiscal from the dod and the intelligence community 
in fiscal and fiscal  services we provided to the us air force space command represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
we also derived approximately of our fiscal and revenue  respectively  from the department of state 
each of these entities consists of a substantial number of separate offices  each of which typically exercises independent decision making and funding authority 
we believe our contract base among these separate offices is well diversified 
in fiscal and fiscal  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenue from contracts on which we acted as prime contractor and derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenue from contracts on which we acted as a subcontractor 
we often subcontract portions of work to be performed under a contract or task order under which we are the prime contractor 
approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  was generated by work performed by subcontractors 
the subcontractors are sometimes responsible for critical portions of the contracted services 
our subcontracting arrangements typically specify that all terms of the primary contract pass down to the subcontractor 
we are not dependent upon any one subcontractor or group of subcontractors to provide a substantial degree of work for us 
in addition  it is typical that a subcontractor on one engagement may be a competitor or a client in other situations 
we believe that cultivating good relationships with our subcontractors is necessary to maintain our competitive position as well as to facilitate meeting performance obligations under our contracts 
backlog backlog is our estimate of the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the remaining life of awarded contracts and task orders we have in hand as of the measurement date 
our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded backlog 
we define funded backlog as estimated future revenue under government contracts and task orders for which funding has been appropriated by congress and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency  plus our estimate of the future revenue we expect to realize from our commercial contracts 
unfunded backlog is the difference between total backlog and funded backlog 
unfunded backlog reflects our estimate of future revenue under awarded government contracts and task orders for which either funding has not yet been appropriated or expenditure has not yet been authorized 
our total backlog does not include estimates of revenue from government wide acquisition contracts  or gwac contracts  or general services administration  or gsa  schedules beyond awarded or funded task orders  but our unfunded backlog does include estimates of revenue beyond awarded or funded task orders for other types of indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity  or id iq  contracts  such as our contract with the us air force space command 
our total backlog as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was funded 
there can be no assurance that we will receive the amounts we have included in our backlog or that we will ultimately recognize the full amount of our funded backlog as of december  as of december   assuming that the acquisition of zen had occurred on such date  our backlog was approximately million  of which million was funded 
we believe that backlog is not necessarily indicative of the future revenue that we will actually receive from contract awards that are included in calculating our backlog 
we assess the potential value of contracts for purposes of backlog based upon several subjective factors 
these subjective factors include our judgments regarding historical trends ie  how much revenue we have received from similar contracts in the past  competition ie  how likely are we to successfully keep all parts of the work to be performed under the contract and budget availability ie  how likely is it that the entire contract will receive the necessary funding 
if we do not accurately assess each of these factors  or if we do not include all of the variables that affect the revenue that we recognize from our contracts  the potential value of our contracts  and accordingly  our backlog  will not reflect the actual revenue received from contracts and task orders 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will receive amounts included in our backlog or that monies will be appropriated by congress or otherwise made available to finance contracts and task orders included in our backlog 
many factors that affect the scheduling of projects could alter the actual timing of revenue on projects included in backlog 
there is always the possibility that the contracts could be adjusted or cancelled 
we adjust our backlog on a quarterly basis to reflect modifications to or renewals of existing contracts  awards of new contracts or approvals of expenditures 
see item a 
risk factors the calculation of our backlog is subject to numerous uncertainties  and we may not receive the full amounts of revenue estimated under the contracts included in our backlog  which could reduce our revenue in future periods 
employees as of december   we had over  employees 
approximately of our employees hold federal government security clearances or have passed national agency checks 
approximately of our employees hold top secret security clearances 
a significant portion of our employees who hold top secret security clearances also hold sensitive compartmental information clearances  which permit us to bid on highly classified projects 
we have no unionized employees and do not have any collective bargaining agreements 
however  current contracts or contracts that we may pursue contracts may require us to have unionized employees 
furthermore  with our acquisition of zen  we have added approximately employees  of which hold security clearances 
we believe we have a good relationship with our employees 
in addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel  we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our executive and senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully 
we believe that the personal reputations of our management team members and the business relationships between individual members of our management team and governmental officials involved in the procurement process and related areas are critical elements of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry  particularly with agencies performing classified operations 
to create and maintain these client relationships  identify potential business opportunities and establish our reputation among our current and potential clients  we depend on our senior management team 
the loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities  which could materially adversely affect our business 
competition we operate in markets that are highly competitive and include a large number of participants 
we compete with many companies  both large and small  for our contracts 
we do not have a consistent number of competitors against whom we repeatedly compete 
if we anticipate that our combined resources may create a competitive advantage  we may team with other companies to perform work under contracts 
these and other companies in our market may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger  have greater financial and other resources  have better or more extensive relationships with governmental officials involved in the procurement process and have greater brand or name recognition 
as a result of the diverse requirements of the federal government and our commercial clients  we frequently form teams with the companies in our markets in order to compete for large procurements  while bidding against them in other situations 
in each of our practice areas  we generally bid against companies of varying sizes and specialties  from small businesses to multi billion dollar corporations 
because of the current industry trend toward consolidation  some of these companies may emerge better able to compete with us 
therefore  it is essential that we differentiate ourselves from these companies 
we believe that our technical abilities  client relationships  past performance  cost containment  reputation and ability to provide quality personnel give us a strong presence in the markets we serve 
in addition  we believe that our culture of respect for and commitment to our clients and business partners greatly aids our business 
while we believe these factors help to set us apart from other companies in our markets  we may not be able to continue to maintain our competitive position  as new companies enter the marketplace and alliances and consolidations among competitors emerge 
some companies in our markets have longer operating histories  greater financial and technological capabilities  greater brand or name recognition and or larger client bases than we have 
government contracting and regulatory processes for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from work performed under federal government contracts 
the government contracting process differs in many ways from commercial contracting  and involves a high degree of federal government regulation and oversight 
historically  agencies of the federal government wishing to procure services from contractors have been required to prepare a request for proposal  known as an rfp  or some similar form of solicitation 
the rfp is typically an extensive document describing the services desired and the terms and conditions that form the final agreement  including the criteria the soliciting agency will use to select the service provider 
interested parties submit proposals in response to the rfp  which the agency evaluate  often requesting additional information and multiple discussions with offerors prior to final award of the contract 
in recent years  the federal government has taken steps to streamline the procurement process 
for example  in  the enactment of fasa made the procurement process substantially faster and less burdensome for companies that secure certain contracts 
fasa was the first of several statutory and regulatory changes in recent years that significantly altered government procurement practices by increasing the number and types of procurement contract vehicles available to federal government clients to satisfy their requirements 
federal governmental agencies are now more likely to use flexible contract vehicles that permit a number of firms to compete for specific orders 
the general services administration multiple award schedule program  or gsa mas program  is an example of a flexible contract vehicle employed by the federal government 
under the gsa mas program  gsa contracts with multiple vendors to provide goods and services  at predetermined prices  to specified authorized buyers 
gsa schedules are listings of services and products  along with their respective prices  offered by approved contractors 
the schedules are maintained by the gsa for use by any federal agency or other authorized entity 
a contractor must successfully complete a pre qualification process in order to be selected by the gsa for inclusion of the contractor s goods or services on a gsa schedule 
when an agency selects services under a gsa schedule contract  the soliciting agency  or the gsa on its behalf  conducts a bidding process  limited to qualified gsa schedule contractors 
the process typically involves substantially less time and cost than the historical  non gsa bidding process 
in addition to the gsa mas program  we also hold other id iq contracts with other individual agencies  which are generally known as task order contracts 
these are essentially umbrella contracts that set forth the basic terms and conditions under which the agency may order goods and services from one  and in some cases  more than one  contractor 
contractors undergo a competitive pre selection process to become eligible to perform work under id iq contracts 
a procuring agency then issues task orders for goods or services to be performed or provided under a contract 
when task orders are issued under multiple award id iq contracts  each awardee typically has an opportunity to be considered for the task order 
the agency desiring contract services may conduct a competition among the interested awardees  resulting in the issuance of a task order to a single contractor 
these contracts have increased competition and pricing pressure by concentrating work under fewer contracts  and requiring competition both prior to the initial award of the contract and throughout the term of the contract in order to obtain task orders for the services we provide  requiring that we make sustained post award marketing efforts to realize revenue under each such contract 
moreover  even if we are qualified to work on a particular new contract or a contract subject to renewal  we might not be awarded business because of the federal government s policy and practice of procuring goods and services from multiple contractors in order to maintain a diverse base of contractors 
in addition  id iq contracts do not obligate the federal government to purchase goods or services above the minimum levels set forth in the contract 
a task order calls for a specific set of services to be delivered by the contractor to a particular client agency 
in our experience  the key factors in competing successfully for these task orders are technical merit  cost  relevant past performance considerations and client trust 
from time to time we are also party to gwacs  which are id iq contracts that permit the aggregation of multiple agencies requirements in a single contract  in order to encourage contractors to offer the best possible prices and to reduce the costs associated with multiple acquisitions 
for single award large scale contracts  such as those targeted by our major program initiative  interested contractors submit information indicating their desire to perform the required services 
the agency then solicits competitive proposals or bids from qualified contractors by providing them with a formal rfp or similar solicitation 
the rfp typically describes the desired services  terms and conditions  and evaluation criteria the agency will use 
offerors then submit proposals in response to the rfp  and the agency evaluates the proposals and makes the award determination 
agencies are encouraged to award contracts on a best value basis 
this means that the contractor selected for the award should  in the agency s judgment  provide the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement  including technical merit  cost and relevant past performance considerations 
the entire acquisition process can sometimes take a year or more 
the competitive process presents a number of risks  including the following we expend substantial funds  managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost that will be required to service any contract we win  which could result in substantial cost overruns  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding  and any such protest or challenge could result in a requirement to resubmit proposals on modified specifications or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
we may be choosen as one of the contractors for a multiple awared gwac  id iq or gsa schedule contract  but not be awarded a sufficient number of tasks under the contract to justify our time  effort  and expense in bidding on the contract and subsequent task orders 
the government may intitially award a gwac  id iq  or gsa schedule contract but fail to provide funding for the number of task orders necessary to justify our time  effort  and expense in bidding on the contract and subsequent task orders 
the government contracts for which we compete typically have multiple year terms  and if we are unable to win a particular contract  we generally will be foreclosed from competing again for that contract until its expiration several years later 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
laws and regulations affecting our business federal government contracts are subject to a number of federal laws and regulations  including the federal acquisition regulation  or far  and cost accounting standards 
these statutes and regulations contain several rules that may affect us significantly 
the anti deficiency act prohibits federal government employees from committing government funds  by contract or otherwise  in excess or in advance of appropriations  unless authorized by a specific statute 
since congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  many of our contracts are funded by the applicable agency annually as congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years 
in addition  since funds are often allocated to agencies by the omb  many of our contracts are incrementally funded 
disappointed bidders and contractors excluded from competing for government contracts and task orders may submit a protest to a contracting officer or the gao within time limits specified under far and gao bid protest rules 
the us court of federal claims also has bid protest jurisdiction 
performance under a contract being protested may be suspended while the protest is pending  and in cases where the contract is found to have been improperly awarded  the contract may be terminated 
certain far clauses  such as the limitation of cost and limitation of funds clauses  limit the federal government s liability for expenditures or obligations beyond those authorized by the applicable contract 
in many cases  contracts are awarded for only one year with a number of successive option years in many cases  four 
agencies are not obligated to exercise these option years  but in our experience most renewal options under our contracts have been exercised 
in addition  certain far clauses allow the federal government to terminate contracts for convenience ie  at will  although the federal government is obligated to pay for costs incurred 
larger contracts may also be subject to the truth in negotiations act and cost accounting standards 
the truth in negotiations act requires us to provide current  accurate and complete cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract  modification or task order that is not subject to full and open competition or other exceptions to the act 
cost accounting standards are applicable to certain contracts and require the contractor to apply consistent accounting practices and comply with specific cost accounting criteria 
the far contract cost principles and procedures sets forth the rules regarding the allocability and allowability of costs incurred in connection with federal government contracts 
the far restricts government contractors from participating in procurements when there is an organizational conflict of interest  or oci  and establishes rules for avoiding  mitigating and neutralizing conflicts of interest in the issuance of contracts by the federal government 
virtually all government contracts  including ours  are subject to the oci rules 
an oci may arise because the nature of the work to be performed by a contractor has the potential  absent some restriction on future activities  to result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor or impair the contractor s objectivity in performing the contract or providing assistance or advice to the federal government 
the government contracting officer is responsible for resolving any significant potential ocis before a contract award is made 
federal government contractors have an obligation to manage and  if necessary  report an oci to the contracting officer 
we have a company wide policy regarding care in the acceptance of and compliance with contractual oci provisions  which includes awareness training programs and coordination and reporting systems 
we review new contracts and task orders at the time we receive them for potential oci issues 
accordingly  we believe that as a result of the systems we have in place  our backlog will not be affected by oci issues 
our books and records are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency  or dcaa  and other governmental audit agencies to ensure that the costs and hourly rates for which we invoice the federal government under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts are in compliance with the cost principles  cost accounting standards and far invoicing regulations 
each fiscal year  we must submit final cost data to the federal government indicating our actual costs incurred for the prior year  exclusive of certain costs that are not recoverable by federal government contractors 
this data is audited  and subject to adjustments by the auditing agency based upon established guidance  which may affect our recovery on cost reimbursable contracts for prior fiscal years 
these audits may also result in assessment of penalties  interest costs and  in extreme cases  debarment 
the federal government retains a portion of the fee earned by us under cost reimbursable contracts until contract completion and audit by the dcaa 
audits of our business units by the dcaa have been completed for all fiscal years through without material adjustments 
in the opinion of management  the audits for other fiscal years through fiscal year will not result in adjustments that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  however  future material adjustments are possible 
our conduct and performance is also subject to the false claims act 
the false claims act prohibits contractors from knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims to the federal government 
we have established standards of conduct for our employees and a reporting mechanism that any of our employees can use to report inappropriate or illegal activities 
from time to time we may engage in activities that require us to comply with the various  us government export control laws and regulations administered by the us department of state  us department of commerce  us treasury office of foreign assets control  and the bureau of customs and boarder protection 
we have dedicated personal assigned to maintain and coordinate our compliance activities in this area

item a 
risk factors risks related to our industry we depend on contracts with the federal government for most of our revenue  and our business would be seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us 
we derived and of our total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively  from federal government contracts  either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor 
this includes and of our total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively  that we derived  either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor  from contracts with agencies of the dod and intelligence community 
we expect that we will continue to derive most of our revenue for the foreseeable future from work performed under federal government contracts 
if we were suspended or otherwise prohibited from contracting with the federal government generally  or with any significant agency of the dod or the intelligence community  or if our reputation or relationship with the federal government or any significant agency of the dod or the intelligence community were impaired  or if any of the foregoing otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us  our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the following chart provides certain information regarding our four largest contracts for fiscal year  in terms of revenues percent of revenues in contract customer expiration date command  control  communications  computer  intelligence  information  technology  surveillance  and reconnaissance citsr us air force space command national visa center nvc department of state includes option periods 
our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with the federal government  we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs 
changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance 
a significant decline in government expenditures  a shift of expenditures away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide  or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal governmental agencies to reduce their expenditures under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty  not to exercise options to extend contracts  or to delay or not enter into new contracts 
any of those actions could seriously harm our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
moreover  although our contracts with governmental agencies often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years  congress usually must approve funds for a given program each government fiscal year and may significantly reduce or eliminate funding for a program 
significant reductions in these appropriations by congress could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additional factors that could have a serious adverse effect on our federal government contracting business include changes in federal government programs or requirements  budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally  or by specific departments or agencies in particular  and changes in fiscal policies or available funding  including potential governmental shutdowns  reduction in the federal government s use of technology solutions firms  and an increase in the number of contracts reserved for small businesses which could result in our inability to compete directly for these prime contracts 
our contracts with the federal government may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion  which could adversely affect our business 
federal government contracts generally contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that give the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including provisions permitting the federal government to terminate our existing contracts  reduce potential future income from our existing contracts  modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts  suspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the federal government or with any specific government agency  impose fines and penalties  subject us to criminal prosecution  subject the award of some contracts to protest or challenge by competitors  which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest or challenge and which may also require the government to solicit new proposals for the contract or result in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract  suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related task orders if the necessary funds are not appropriated by congress  decline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiple year contract  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by us 
the federal government may terminate a contract with us either for convenience for instance  due to a change in its perceived needs or its desire to consolidate work under another contract or if we default by failing to perform under the contract 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us for convenience  we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us based upon our default  we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source and other damages as authorized by law 
as is common with government contractors  we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under some of our contracts 
we may in the future receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the federal government s satisfaction  could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts 
our federal government contracts typically have terms of one or more base years and one or more option years 
many of the option periods cover more than half of the contract s potential term 
federal governmental agencies generally have the right not to exercise options to extend a contract 
a decision to terminate or not to exercise options to extend our existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our federal government contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that could limit our ability to compete for certain related follow on contracts 
for example  when we work on the design of a particular solution  we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that solution 
while we actively monitor our contracts to avoid these conflicts  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid all organizational conflict of interest issues 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies  our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected 
to develop new business opportunities  we primarily rely on establishing and maintaining relationships with various government entities and agencies 
we may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies  and any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully for new business 
we derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive acquisition process 
if we are unable to win new awards or successfully compete for renewal contracts  our business and prospects may be adversely affected 
a significant number of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through a competitive process 
we expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding of new contracts and task orders and contracts subject to renewal 
recently  members of congress and administration officials have authorized changes to the procurement process intended to increase competition among suppliers to the federal government 
budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many federal government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through id iq  contracts  including gsa contracts  and other gwacs 
these contracts have increased competition and pricing pressure by concentrating work under fewer contracts  and requiring competition both prior to the initial award of the contract and throughout the term of the contract in order to obtain task orders for the services we provide  requiring that we make sustained post award marketing efforts to realize revenue under each such contract 
these contracts generally approve particular contractors to provide specified goods and services to the applicable governmental agency but generally do not obligate the agency to purchase any particular amount of goods or services 
to procure goods or services under the contract  the agency generally awards task orders to perform specified services or to supply specified goods pursuant to competition among approved contractors 
thus  the existence of a contract does not ensure future revenue  rather  the contract merely provides us the opportunity to compete for additional work 
an agency may administer an id iq contract in which it procures goods and services for itself 
under the same contract  other federal agencies may also procure goods and services 
these contracts are known as gwacs 
when multiple prime contractors hold gwacs for the same goods and services  all of them are eligible to supply goods and services under the contract 
as a result  qualified contractors often compete with each other to obtain task orders under a gwac 
similarly  gsa contracts  including contracts commonly known as gsa schedule contracts  are procurement contracts administered by the gsa on behalf of the entire federal government 
like many other id iq contracts  multiple contractors may be awarded gsa contracts for the same goods and services 
as a result  an agency may procure goods and services from any contractor awarded the gsa contract at the prices and on the terms stated in the contract 
moreover  even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract or a contract subject to renewal  we might not be awarded business because of the federal government s policy and practice of procuring goods and services from multiple contractors in order to maintain a diverse base of contractors 
the competitive process presents a number of risks  including the following we expend substantial funds  managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost that will be required to service any contract we win  which could result in substantial cost overruns  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding  and any such protest or challenge could result in a requirement to resubmit proposals on modified specifications or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
the government contracts for which we compete typically have multiple year terms  and if we are unable to win a particular contract  we generally will be foreclosed from competing again for that contract until its expiration several years later 
if we are unable to win new contract awards  our business and prospects will be adversely affected 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
approximately of our revenue recognized during fiscal was derived from contracts that  as of february   are  or are expected to become  subject to recompetition bids prior to the end of government fiscal ending september  
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid or recompetition bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract  and the termination or nonrenewal of any of our significant contracts or a substantial portion of our other contracts could materially adversely affect our operating results 
our business may suffer if our facilities or our employees are unable to obtain or retain the security clearances or other qualifications needed to perform services for our clients 
many of our federal government contracts require employees and facilities used in specific engagements to hold security clearances and to clear agency checks and defense security service checks 
many of our contracts require us to employ personnel with specified levels of education  work experience and security clearances 
depending on the level of clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if our employees or our facilities lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances or successfully clear necessary agency or defense security service checks  we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them 
to the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the security clearances necessary for our facilities or our employees working on a particular contract or to the extent our facilities or our employees do not successfully clear necessary agency checks or defense security service checks  we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract  and our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we must comply with a variety of laws  regulations and procedures and our failure to comply could harm our operating results 
we must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and impose added costs on our business 
for example  the federal acquisition regulation and the industrial security regulations of the department of defense and related laws include provisions that allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership  control or influence  require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information  and require us to comply with laws and regulations intended to promote various social or economic goals 
some of our activities are subject to the export control laws and regulations administered by the department of state  department of commerce  treasury office of foreign assets control  and the bureau of customs and boarder protection additionally  we are subject to industrial security regulations of the dod and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners access to classified information 
if we were to come under foreign ownership  control or influence  we could lose our facility security clearances  which could result in our federal government customers terminating or deciding not to renew our contracts  and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
in addition  our employees often must comply with procedures required by the specific agency for which work is being performed  such as time recordation or prohibition on removal of materials from a location 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations or procedures  including federal procurement regulations and regulations regarding the protection of classified information  could result in contract termination  loss of security clearances  suspension or prohibition from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
the federal government may revise its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
the federal government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  such as cost accounting standards 
it could also adopt new contracting methods relating to gsa contracts  gwacs or other government wide contracts  or adopt new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain social or other policy objectives  such as establishing new set aside programs for small or minority owned businesses 
in addition  the federal government may face restrictions from new legislation or regulations  as well as pressure from government employees and their unions  on the nature and amount of services the federal government may obtain from private contractors 
these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are put up for recompetition bids 
any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement  and  as a result  could harm our operating results 
for example  the truthfulness  responsibility and accountability in contracting act  proposed in  would have limited and severely delayed the federal government s ability to use private service contractors 
although this proposal was not enacted  it or similar legislation could be proposed at any time 
any reduction in the federal government s use of private contractors to provide federal information technology services could materially adversely impact our business 
our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 
federal governmental agencies  including the dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review our performance on contracts  pricing practices and cost structure 
they also review our compliance with applicable laws  government regulations  policies and standards and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
moreover  if any of our administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with the applicable requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny or required to obtain additional governmental approvals that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
therefore  an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the dcaa or another government agency  such as the defense security service  or dss  which verifies security compliance  could materially adversely affect our competitive position and result in a substantial reduction of our revenues 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
failure to maintain strong relationships with other government contractors could result in a decline in our revenue 
we derived of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal from contracts under which we acted as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid together on particular contracts or programs 
as a subcontractor or team member  we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract  and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation  even when we perform as required 
we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our revenue and operating results could be materially adversely affected if any prime contractor or teammate chooses to offer a client services of the type that we provide or if any prime contractor or teammate teams with other companies to independently provide those services 
the calculation of our backlog is subject to numerous uncertainties  and we may not receive the full amounts of revenue estimated under the contracts included in our backlog  which could reduce our revenue in future periods 
backlog is our estimate of the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the remaining life of the awarded contracts and task orders we have in hand as of the measurement date 
our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded backlog 
we define funded backlog as estimated future revenues under government contracts and task orders for which funding has been appropriated by congress and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency under our contracts  plus estimated future revenues we expect to receive under signed purchase orders with commercial clients 
unfunded backlog is the difference between total backlog and funded backlog 
unfunded backlog reflects our estimate of future revenues under awarded government contracts and task orders for which either funding has not been appropriated or expenditures have not been authorized 
our total backlog does not include estimates of revenue from gwac or gsa schedules beyond contract or task order awards  but our unfunded backlog does include estimates of revenue beyond contract or task order awards for other types of id iq contracts  including our command  control  communications  computer  intelligence  information  technology  surveillance  and reconnaissance citsr contract with the us air force space command 
the calculation of backlog is highly subjective and is subject to numerous uncertainties and estimates  and there can be no assurance that we will in fact receive the amounts we have included in our backlog 
our assessment of a contract s potential value is based upon factors such as historical trends  competition and budget availability 
in the case of contracts which may be renewed at the option of the applicable agency  we generally calculate backlog by assuming that the agency will exercise all of its renewal options  however  the applicable agency may elect not to exercise its renewal options 
in addition  federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term  and all or some of the work to be performed under a contract may remain unfunded unless and until congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract 
our estimate of the portion of backlog from which we expect to recognize revenues in fiscal or any future period is likely to be inaccurate because the receipt and timing of any of these revenues is dependent upon subsequent appropriation and allocation of funding and is subject to various contingencies  such as timing of task orders  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we may never receive revenues from some of the engagements that are included in our backlog and this risk is greater with respect to unfunded backlog 
the actual receipt of revenues on engagements included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change  the program could be canceled  the governmental agency could elect not to exercise renewal options under a contract or could select other contractors to perform services  or a contract could be reduced  modified or terminated 
we adjust our backlog on a quarterly basis to reflect modifications to or renewals of existing contracts or task orders  awards of new contracts or task orders  or approvals of expenditures 
additionally  the maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract 
we also derive revenues from id iq contracts  which typically do not require the government to purchase a specific amount of goods or services under the contract other than a minimum quantity which is generally very small 
if we fail to realize revenue included in our backlog  our revenues and operating results for the then current fiscal year as well as future reporting periods could be materially adversely affected 
loss of our gsa contracts or gwacs would impair our ability to attract new business 
we are a prime contractor under several gsa contracts and gwac schedule contracts 
we believe that our ability to continue to provide services under these contracts will continue to be important to our business because of the multiple opportunities for new engagements each contract provides 
if we were to lose our position as prime contractor on one or more of these contracts  we could lose substantial revenues and our operating results could suffer 
gsa contracts and other gwacs typically have a one or two year initial term with multiple options exercisable at the government client s discretion to extend the contract for one or more years 
we cannot be assured that our government clients will continue to exercise the options remaining on our current contracts  nor can we be assured that our future clients will exercise options on any contracts we may receive in the future 
if subcontractors on our prime contracts are able to secure positions as prime contractors  we may lose revenue 
for each of the past several years  as the gsa schedule contracts and gwacs have increasingly been used as contract vehicles  we have received substantial revenue from government clients relating to work performed by other information technology providers acting as subcontractors to us 
in some cases  companies that have not held gsa schedule contracts or secured positions as prime contractors on gwacs have approached us in our capacity as a prime contractor  seeking to perform services as our subcontractor for a government client 
some of these providers that are currently acting as subcontractors to us may in the future secure positions as prime contractors 
if one or more of our current subcontractors are awarded prime contractor status in the future  it could reduce or eliminate our revenue for the work they were performing as subcontractors to us 
revenue derived from work performed by our subcontractors represented approximately and  respectively of our revenue for each of fiscal and risks associated with international operations our international business exposes us to additional risks including exchange rate fluctuations  foreign tax and legal regulations and political or economic instability that could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in connection providing services to our clients  we are sometimes required to engage in international operations including international operations under us government contracts 
conducting international business subjects us to risks associated with operating in and selling to foreign countries  including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell all of our products or repatriate profits to the united states  imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars  imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures  compliance with us laws and regulations that apply extraterritorially which may conflict  in whole or in part  with local laws and regulations in countries where we operate  compliance with the local labor laws of the countries in which we operate  hyperinflation or political instability in foreign countries  potential personal injury to our personnel who may be exposed to military conflict situations in foreign countries  imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments  compliance with us export control laws and regulations  which may effect our ability to provide goods and services abroad 
to the extent that our customers request us to provide services and support outside of the united states  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
although such risks have not harmed our operating results in the past  no assurance can be given that such risks will not materially adversely affect our operating results in the future 
risks related to our business we may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of our performance under fixed price or time and materials contracts 
some of our contracts require that we perform on a fixed price basis 
we derived of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal from fixed price contracts 
a fixed price contract generally provides that we will receive a specified price for our performance under the contract  regardless of the cost to us of such performance 
this requires that we accurately estimate the cost that we will incur to perform our obligations under any contract at the time that we submit our proposal to the applicable government agency 
when making proposals for engagements on a fixed price basis  we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects 
these estimates are subject to numerous variables and uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the costs of performing under any fixed price contract will not exceed  perhaps substantially  our estimates 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts  including costs and delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable than anticipated or could cause us to incur losses  which could be substantial  on these contracts 
in the past  we have from time to time incurred losses on some fixed price contracts and our profits on some fixed price contracts have been less than anticipated 
our operating results could be materially adversely affected if the actual costs of performing under these contracts exceed our estimates 
many of our contracts are performed on a time and materials basis 
a time and materials contract typically provides that we are paid a fixed hourly rate for direct labor costs expended and reimbursed for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
we derived of our total revenues in fiscal and of our total revenues for fiscal from time and materials contracts 
while time and materials contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed price contracts  to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates  we may lose money on the contract 
our margins and operating results may suffer if cost reimbursable contracts increase as a percentage of our total government contracts 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
our cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs  which are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  as well as payment of a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
our time and materials contracts generally are more profitable than our cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts contributed and of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
to the extent that cost reimbursable contracts represent an increased proportion of our total government contracts  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our markets are highly competitive  and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources 
we operate in highly competitive markets that include a large number of participants and involve intense competition to win contracts 
many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger  have greater financial and other resources  have better or more extensive relationships with government officials involved in the procurement process and have greater brand or name recognition 
in order to stay competitive in our industry  we must attract and retain the highly skilled employees necessary to provide our services and keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences 
in addition  some of our competitors have established alliances or strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties in order to increase their ability to address client needs 
as a result  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can 
there is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation which may result in the emergence of larger companies that may be better able to compete with us 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our failure to attract and retain qualified employees  including our executive and senior management team  may adversely affect our business 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively 
our business involves the development of tailored technology solutions for our clients  a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees 
competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense  and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees 
recruiting and training these employees require substantial resources 
our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contracts  reduce our ability to meet our clients needs  limit our ability to win new business and constrain our ability to grow 
certain types of services are subject to the service contract act and the davis bacon act 
these acts require that the contractor pay to all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits  as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the department of labor 
we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate rfp s that include service contract act and davis bacon act requirements and  in the event of an award to us  ensure our compliance with these requirements 
we may be affected by intellectual property infringement claims 
our business operations may rely on intellectual property 
our employees develop some of the software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that we use to provide it solutions to our customers  but we also may license technology from other entities 
typically  under federal government contracts  our customers may claim rights in the intellectual property we develop  making it impossible for us to prevent their future use of our intellectual property 
we are and may in the future be subject to claims from our employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that we used in delivering services and solutions to our customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if our vendors  employees or third parties assert claims that we or our customers are infringing on their intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  we could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign our products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology 
a substantial majority of our historical growth has been due to acquisitions and we may have difficulty identifying and executing future acquisitions on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
a substantial majority of our historical growth was the result of acquisitions  and the selective pursuit of acquisitions remains one of our key growth strategies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and execute suitable acquisitions in the future on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
we may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy  including increased competition for acquisitions which may increase the price of our acquisitions  and our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process  including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations such as the federal acquisition regulation and health  safety  employment and environmental laws and regulations  or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other clients 
in connection with any future acquisitions  we may decide to consolidate the operations of any acquired business with our existing operations or to make other changes with respect to the acquired business  which could result in special charges or other expenses 
our results of operations also may be adversely affected by expenses we incur in making acquisitions and  in the event that any goodwill resulting from present or future acquisitions is found to be impaired  by goodwill impairment charges 
as of december   assuming that the zen acquisition had occurred on such date  we had approximately million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions on our balance sheet and  to the extent we make future acquisitions  the amount of goodwill could increase  perhaps substantially 
any of the businesses we acquire may also have liabilities or adverse operating issues 
in addition  our ability to make future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing and we may be materially adversely affected if we cannot obtain additional financing for any future acquisitions 
to the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock  fluctuations in our stock price could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete acquisitions and the issuance of common stock to acquire other businesses could be dilutive to our stockholders 
to the extent that we use borrowings to acquire other businesses  our debt service obligations could increase substantially and relevant debt instruments may  among other things  impose additional restrictions on our operations  require us to comply with additional financial covenants or require us to pledge additional assets to secure our borrowings 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
the success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future 
the integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen events or operating difficulties  absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
these integration difficulties could include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds  the transition to new information systems  coordination of geographically dispersed organizations  loss of key employees of acquired companies and reconciliation of different corporate cultures 
for these or other reasons  we may be unable to retain key clients or to retain or renew contracts of acquired companies 
moreover  any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost savings that we anticipated 
any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business may be adversely affected 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on our management  as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
if we continue to grow  we must improve our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  motivate and manage our workforce 
if we are unable to do so  or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing any future growth do not produce the expected benefits  our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
any systems failures  including failure of network  software or hardware systems  whether caused by us  a third party service provider  unauthorized intruders and hackers  computer viruses  natural disasters  power shortages or terrorist attacks  could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients 
in addition  the failure or disruption of mail  communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption  and insurance to cover these types of risks may not be available in the future on terms that we consider acceptable  if at all 
the systems and networks that we maintain for our clients  although redundant in their design  could also fail 
if a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions  we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination 
our liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for damages that we might incur and liability insurance to cover these types of risks may not be available in the future on terms that we consider acceptable  or at all 
if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations  our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue in each of fiscal and fiscal was generated by work performed by subcontractors who perform a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
in extreme cases  a subcontractor s performance deficiency could result in the federal government terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders 
our indebtedness and debt service obligations may increase substantially and we will be subject to restriction under debt instruments 
as of december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding under our credit agreement which had a borrowing capacity of million  comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan facility 
we further amended this credit agreement  pursuant to the first amendment entered into contemporaneously with the closing of our acquisition of zen on february   which increased the available term loan amount to approximately million 
we had approximately million of debt outstanding under our amended credit agreement on february  following the closing of our acquisition of zen 
our leverage may increase as a result of any future acquisitions and  accordingly  the amount of our indebtedness will likely increase  perhaps substantially 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be applied to pay our debt service obligations  thus reducing cash available for other purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible disadvantage compared to our competitors with less leverage or better access to capital 
our amended credit agreement bears interest at variable rates based upon prevailing market interest rates  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates 
also  our amended credit agreement requires that we comply with various financial covenants and impose restrictions on us  including restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens  make acquisitions and pay dividends on our capital stock 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on  or to refinance  our debt will depend primarily on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to the economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs 
if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs 
we cannot assure you that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 
if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our amended credit agreement  our lenders may exercise remedies  including requiring immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts 
these financial covenants are calculated according to the definition of terms contained in the amended credit agreement  which may differ from calculations using generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the financial covenants in our credit facility following the acquisition of zen include the following the first amendment to credit agreement amended the leverage ratio that requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to consolidated ebitda for such period as follows period amended term loan maximum ratio first amendment effective date through fiscal quarter ending june  to july  through fiscal quarter ending june  to june  through fiscal quarter ending june  to june  and thereafter to a fixed charge coverage ratio that requires us to maintain a ratio  on a consolidated basis for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter  of i consolidated ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures for such period  to ii the sum of consolidated interest expense plus scheduled funded debt payments plus cash taxes for such period  of greater than or equal to to  and the amount of consolidated capital expenditures made in cash during any fiscal year is limited to of consolidated gross revenues plus the unused portion on consolidated capital expenditures that would have been permitted in the previous fiscal year in an amount not to exceed  the borrowings and other amounts due under our amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our current and future tangible and intangible assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and capital stock of our existing or future subsidiaries 
our ability to obtain other debt financing may therefore be adversely affected because the lenders under our amended credit agreement will have a prior lien on our assets to secure amounts we owe to them 
in addition  upon the occurrence of specified events of default under the amended credit agreement  the lenders would be entitled to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings and other amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement and to realize upon the collateral pledged under the amended credit agreement to satisfy our obligations to them 
the amended credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of our assets securing the debt  restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens  restricting our ability to incur additional debt beyond certain levels and in certain circumstances  restricting our ability to make certain distributions  investments and restricted payments  including dividend payments on our equity securities  restricting our ability to alter the conduct of our business or corporate existence  restricting our ability to amend  modify  cancel  terminate or fail to renew material contracts  restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates  restricting our ability to consolidate  merge  or sell our assets  restricting our ability to purchase property or assets other than in the ordinary course of business  and restricting our ability to amend  modify or change our organizational documents  including our charter and bylaws 
risks related to our common stock provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist an attempt to take over our company 
for example  our board of directors can issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval  and the board could issue stock to dilute and adversely affect various rights of a potential acquiror 
other provisions of our charter and bylaws that could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us include the division of our board of directors into three separate classes serving staggered three year terms  the absence of cumulative voting in the election of our directors  which means that the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock have the power to elect all of our directors  limitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and the provisions requiring that vacancies in our board of directors must be filled by the remaining directors  prohibitions on our stockholders from acting by written consent or calling special meetings  and procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law that  subject to exceptions  would prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  as defined in that section  for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder 
the board could use these and other provisions to discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions might also discourage  delay or prevent an acquisition of our company at a price that you may find attractive 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for you and our other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
future sales of shares of our common stock and the resulting dilution that would occur with such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market in the course of any offering made pursuant to a registration statement  including any subsequent registration statement  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
item properties as of december   we leased offices and warehouse at various us locations for an aggregate of  square feet in states and the district of columbia  of which we sublease  square feet to third parties

the facilities are substantially utilized and are adequate for present operations 
we do not own any real estate 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in litigation  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
in addition  we are subject to audit  review  and investigation by various agencies of the federal government to determine compliance with applicable federal statutes and regulations 
as a federal government contractor  we are subject to audit by certain federal agencies to determine if our performance and administration of our government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
while we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes to which we are or may be subject  we currently believe  based upon information available to us as of the date of this filing  that any ultimate liability arising out of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the sei acquisition agreement provides for a purchase price adjustment based upon the working capital of sei as of the closing date 
subsequent to the closing date  we received a payment of million in connection with services performed prior to the closing date that sei had not previously billed  and was not authorized to bill  its customer as of the closing date 
the sei selling stockholders have asserted that they are entitled to a credit in connection with the calculation of working capital adjustment in an amount equal to the amount received by us for this post closing payment 
we believe that  in accordance with gaap  the sei selling stockholders should not receive the benefit of the post closing payment 
in accordance with the terms of the sei acquisition agreement  the parties have jointly submitted the issue to an independent accounting firm for resolution

overview we are  first and foremost  a provider of information technology and network solutions it to the federal government 
our clients include the us air force  us army  us navy  department of state  department of homeland security  department of energy  department of agriculture  national institutes of health  federal retirement thrift investment board  national guard bureau  and the intelligence community 
we combine our technology and industry expertise to provide a full spectrum of state of the practice solutions and services  from design and development to implementation and operations  which assist our clients in achieving mission success 
we believe that our company is distinguishable from our peers within the federal it sector in several important respects 
we employ a rapid response rapid deployment methodology that enables the rapid standing up of innovative solutions and the incorporation of additional capabilities in rapid succession 
this capability allows us to respond to urgent it imperatives quickly  often in a matter of months  and within a well defined budget 
we can  therefore  provide solutions for current it needs  while establishing a platform for advancing long term transformational objectives 
we possess a proven ability to respond to high priority information technology and network needs through innovation  and an enviable reputation for timely delivery of robust solutions on assignments where failure is not an option 
our mission critical  mission accomplished solutions enable clients to respond to new mandates  expand the scope of their missions  and reengineer underlying business processes 
we have a demonstrated ability of turning troubled it projects into winning outcomes and realized exceptional growth from high quality client engagements 
we also utilize mature and proven processes to manage and market large scale id iq contracts  such as citsr 
we employ a diverse  innovative team that effectively utilizes small business partners unique skills and expertise for mission critical it projects 
fiscal review and fiscal outlook during the past year  we experienced continued growth in our four key focus areas defense transformation  homeland defense  federal it modernization  and mission critical outsourcing 
in terms of customer concentration  the dod continues to grow faster organically than our other customers  which is the result of ongoing defense transformation initiatives that require our specialty in rapidly performing mission critical work 
virtually all of our engagements with the dod either directly support  or are closely related to dod transformation goals 
we will continue aligning our programs and capabilities along our focus areas of homeland defense  federal it modernization  mission critical outsourcing  and defense transformation  given these sectors most accurately reflect our customer s highest priorities 
the federal government s increased use of technology as a weapon in the war on terrorism and to enhance operational efficiency among federal agencies drove our growth in we expect that government initiatives involving information sharing  net centric warfare  and business process transformation will be among our customer base s key focus areas in with the sei acquisition  our support to civilian agencies increased as a percentage of total revenue 
sei s largest client was the department of homeland security 
the national priority on securing our borders  along with urgent need for information sharing and other critical department of homeland security issues  will continue driving the demand for budget increases in homeland defense 
with the bridge acquisition  we expanded our presence in the intelligence community 
we believe that this ongoing need for improved intelligence collection will not diminish 
for the foreseeable future  we anticipate that dod s  department of homeland security s  and the intelligence community s it and network requirements will be the largest drivers of our organic growth 
also  strategic acquisitions that add value will continue to impact our future customer mix 
finally  the recent zen acquisition provides us with greater access to new customers and additional cross selling opportunities for our portfolio of mission critical solutions 
the addition of sei and bridge allowed us to continue supporting our existing customer base  while strengthening our position with the deparment of homeland security and the intelligence community 
after consummating the sei and bridge acquisitions  we realigned our practice areas in to reflect the additional areas of expertise that we obtained from these two companies 
our eight practice areas now consist of program management acquisition support  integrated solutions development  information security  records management  learning solutions  systems engineering  network solutions  and mission critical outsourcing 
in  congress delayed approving the government fiscal appropriations bills 
for us  this impact was largely confined to new project starts previously forecasted for our fourth quarter fiscal even in years where congress passed appropriations bills in a timely fashion  it is not uncommon for several months to pass before funding was actually issued 
with the combination of the gsa s reorganization and recent contract award delays  we expect that government agencies will continue moving away from using gsa contract vehicles and start utilizing government wide and agency specific contract vehicles more frequently in until the gsa reorganization is complete 
in fiscal and fiscal  we received and  respectively  of our revenues from services we provided to various departments and agencies of the federal government  both directly and through other prime contractors  and and  respectively  of our total revenues from work performed for commercial entities 
the following table shows our revenues from the client groups listed as a percentage of total revenue 
revenue data for the dod includes revenue generated from work performed under engagements for both the dod and the intelligence community 
fiscal year department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial entities total revenue as a result of the zen acquisition  we believe that the percentage of our revenue attributable to the dod and federal civilian agencies should increase  and the percentage of our revenue attributable to commercial entities  including international operations  should decrease marginally 
we have derived a substantial majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services indirectly as a subcontractor 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue as a result of the zen acquisition  we believe the percentage of our prime contract revenue may increase marginally 
our services are provided under three types of contracts cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total as a result of the acquisition of zen  we anticipate that during fiscal year that the percentage of our revenue attributable to time and materials and fixed price contracts may increase marginally 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may either be greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
while a substantial number of these contracts are generally less than six months in duration  we have several multi year contracts of this type in which the customer has the option to extend the contractual term beyond the current term 
if we anticipate a loss on a contract  we provide for the full amount of anticipated loss at the time of that determination 
our most significant expense is direct cost  which consists primarily of direct labor costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete contracts  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
our ability to predict accurately the number and types of personnel  their salaries  and other costs  can have a significant impact on our direct cost 
the allowability of certain direct and indirect costs in federal contracts is subject to audit by the client  usually through the dcaa 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts and paid by the client using provisional  or estimated  indirect rates  which are subject to later revision  based on the government audits of those costs 
approximately of our revenue recognized during fiscal was derived from contracts that  as of february   are  or are expected to become  subject to competitive bids prior to the end of government fiscal we actively monitor our relationships with our clients during our engagements  as well as the quality of the service we provide  to assist in our efforts to win recompetition bids 
in addition  we strive to maintain good relationships with a wide variety of government contractors 
recent events zen acqusition 
on february   we closed the acquisition of zen 
zen is a provider of critical it services  specializing in managed network services  information assurance  software development and systems engineering  database and systems administration and it consulting to various us government agencies 
zen s largest clients include the missile defense agency mda  department of defense s washington headquarters services whs  federal communications commission fcc  the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc  and the federal trade commission ftc 
as a result of our acquisition of zen  we gained approximately employees  of which approximately hold security clearances 
the acquisition of zen provides additional scale with existing customers as well as diversification with new government customers 
pursuant to the terms of the zen agreement we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of zen for million in cash  of which we are withholding million for months in order to secure post closing indemnity obligations of the sellers 
the purchase price is subject to a two way adjustment based upon whether the working capital of zen as of the closing date was above or below the target working capital specified in the zen agreement 
each of the parties to the zen agreement has made customary representations and warranties and agreed to certain indemnification obligations 
the transaction was funded through cash on hand  a subordinated seller s note in the amount of million  and borrowing from our newly amended credit facility  which is described below 
we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings 
zen s trailing twelve months revenue ended november   was approximately million unaudited 
amendment to credit facility 
on february   we entered into the first amendment 
the first amendment provides new terms and conditions with respect to the term loan portion of the credit agreement and increased the available term loan amount to approximately million from approximately million 
the funds borrowed under the new term loan were used to a refinance the initial term loan  b to finance the acquisition of zen  and c to provide for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the first amendment amended the leverage ratio that requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to consolidated ebitda for such period as follows period new maximum ratio prior maximum ratio first amendment effective date through fiscal quarter ending june  to to july  through fiscal quarter ending june  to to june  through fiscal quarter ending june  to to june  and thereafter to to these ratios will be calculated in accordance with the definitions and terms contained in the amended credit agreement  which may be different than calculations pursuant to gaap 
nvc contract award 
on january   in a recompetition for our expiring national visa center  or nvc  contract  we were awarded the successor contract for the nvc contract by the department of state 
under the contract  we anticipate performing over million immigrant visa transactions each year at the nvc in portsmouth  new hampshire and at the kentucky consular center in williamsburg  kentucky 
the prime contract has a one year base period and four one year options with a potential value of approximately million  inclusive of the options 
the prior nvc contract generated of our total revenues in fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal acceleration of vesting of stock options 
on december   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of unvested stock options previously awarded to employees  officers and directors as of december  in light of new accounting regulations that were to come into effect january  based on the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  the board took the action to accelerate the unvested stock with the belief that it is in the best interest of stockholders  as it will reduce the company s reported compensation expense in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources general 
short term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital  capital expenditures  and the need to provide debt service 
we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under our amended credit agreement 
we anticipate that our long term liquidity requirements  including any further acquisitions  will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations  borrowings under our amended credit agreement  additional secured or unsecured debt or the issuance of common or preferred stock  each of which may be initially funded through borrowings under our amended credit agreement 
cash and cash equivalents 
we consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  including marketable securities  as of the end of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were million  million  and million  respectively

fiscal year revenue costs and expenses direct costs indirect costs depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government  primarily by our employees and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
revenues from work under federal government contracts increased to million from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to federal business acquired  new contract awards  successful recompetition wins on existing programs and growth within existing programs in our three focus areas federal it modernization mission critical outsourcing  defense transformation  and homeland defense 
commercial and other revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to our continued focus on opportunities for the federal government 
we expect revenue growth to continue primarily from federal government civilian and defense organizations 
direct costs 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs  such as materials and subcontracts  incurred to provide our services and solutions to our customers 
generally  changes in direct costs are correlated to changes in revenue as resources are consumed in the production of that revenue 
the increase in direct costs from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  direct costs were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal direct costs will continue to increase in conjunction to revenue growth 
indirect costs 
indirect costs include facilities  selling  bid and proposal  indirect labor  fringe benefits and other discretionary costs 
the increase in indirect costs from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the expected growth of support functions necessary to facilitate and administer the growth in direct costs 
in fiscal  indirect costs were of revenue compared to of revenue in fiscal however  we believe in future years  indirect costs will continue to grow  but should decrease as a percentage of sales

the increase in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to the borrowing of debt subsequent to the acquisitions of bridge  sei and matcom 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense was for fiscal as compared to for the same period in fiscal we anticipate an increase in interest expense in fiscal year due to increased borrowings under our amended credit agreement made in connection with the zen acquisition

the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal year percentage change revenue direct costs indirect costs depreciation amortization amortization of intangible assets income from operations other income expense interest expense provision for income taxes net income supplemental quarterly information the following table sets forth quarterly unaudited consolidated financial data for the fiscal quarters of and  expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the respective periods 
we believe that this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for each period 
all of the fiscal quarters reflected in the following table had thirteen weeks  except for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which has fourteen weeks 
some unevenness of revenue from quarter to quarter exists primarily because of the timing of purchases of materials necessary to perform certain obligations under our cisr contract with us air force space command

in connection with our acquisition of zen  we borrowed approximately million in long term debt which will be repaid in consecutive quarterly payments of  each  starting from march  through december   and a final payment of approximately million on february  effects of inflation we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but we have generally have not been adversely affected by inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  we were not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
our critical accounting policies also include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue under its contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs  and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion of the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost reimbursable contracts that include performance based fee incentives  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
revenue on time and materials contracts are recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on unit pricing  we recognize revenue for the number of units delivered in any given fiscal period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of similar acts  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of those acts completed compared to the number of total specified acts required by the contract 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of defined but not similar acts  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the project s percentage total costs incurred compared to the estimated total costs associated with the entire transaction 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues and associated contract costs are recognized upon product delivery and customer acceptance 
our contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectibility of the contract price  we consider our previous experiences with our customers  communications with our customers regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of the normal management processes  facts develop that require revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the allowability of certain costs under government contracts is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price of the related option 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our financial reports for the year ended december  the disclosures determine compensation cost for our stock options based on sfas no 
 which reflects the fair value of each option estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
statement r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement generally requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under statement  as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
statement r is effective for the company beginning january  all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
see recent events above for a discussion of changes to our stock option programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates for borrowings under our credit facility 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
as part of this strategy  we may use interest rate swap arrangements to manage or hedge our interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement 
a change in interest rates would have resulted in our interest expense fluctuating by approximately  for the three months ended december  effective february   an interest swap agreement came into effect which reduced our exposure associated with the market volatility of floating libor interest rates 
this agreement has a notional principal amount of million and  as of december   had a rate ranging from to 
this agreement is a hedge against term debt  which bears interest at libor plus a margin which has a current overall rate of 
at stated monthly intervals the difference between the interest on the floating libor based debt and the interest calculated in the swap agreement are settled in cash 
in addition  historically  our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we have typically made investments in a fund with an effective average maturity of fewer than days and a portfolio make up consisting primarily of commercial paper and notes  variable rate instruments  and  to a lesser degree  overnight securities and bank instruments 
since our initial public offering  the board of directors approved an investment policy that requires us to invest in relatively short term  high quality  and high liquidity obligations
