item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable the company performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and assesses the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory the company estimates the carrying value of its inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes the company has recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
the company must estimate its income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the deductibility of the disposal of scrap and worthless inventory  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   an increase of  over the december  level 
during  the company s continuing operations provided cash of  investing activities used cash of  financing activities provided cash of  and discontinued operations used cash of  cash provided from continuing operations of  resulted mainly from net earnings of  adjusted for the non cash effect of depreciation of  and the  reduction in working capital 
the net decrease in working capital was mainly due to a  reduction in inventory and a  increase in current liabilities  offset in part by a  increase in accounts receivable  net 
the decrease in inventory was mainly due to orders being filled from existing inventory and the continuing control over inventory purchases and levels 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable resulting from higher pre tax earnings and an increase in accounts payable resulting from the timing of inventory and capital equipment purchases 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly due to the increase in the days sales outstanding from days in to days in capital expenditures amounted to  in the company s budget for capital expenditures is approximately  management believes that based on its current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations the company s resources are sufficient to meet its financial needs and to fund the capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus net sales decreased  or from mainly due to lower sales of manufactured products 
sales in the buy and resell product line increased slightly over the level 
during  the actual number of units sold has decreased about from the prior year  as the company continues to move to more value added  high reliability high rel products with higher overall average selling prices and higher margins 
the book to bill ratio during was  versus in the company s backlog amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  while the company experienced some modest growth in its principal market telecommunication infrastructure in  it was offset by overall price compression and the company s conscious effort to discontinue low margin product 
management believes that the company will continue to be challenged by price compression and the industry wide excess capacity issues in and beyond 
in addition  our near term visibility continues to be poor and we continue to see customer orders for small quantities with near term delivery dates 
the company reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in the higher margin was mainly attributable to decreases in raw material costs due to changes in product mix toward the more value added  high rel products with higher selling prices as well as some yield improvements 
direct labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales in the remained fairly consistent with that in selling and advertising expenses were comparable to that in decreases in personnel and benefit expenses of  and travel and entertainment expenses of  were offset by a  increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in bad debt expense over the amount was mainly due to the expense provision benefiting from the  recovery of accounts receivable written off in prior years 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from mainly as a result of a reduction in personnel and benefit expenses 
research and development expenses increased  over primarily as a result of increased personnel and benefit expenses 
this expense increase was consistent with the company s plan to make significant engineering investments in new product development in the increase in interest income for over was due to a combination of higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during the current year

management continues to be unsure of the potential impact on its future operations from the current continuing telecom market uncertainties and our industries over capacity issues 
the company reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in about of the dollar increase was due to the gross profit provided by the mf electronics product line sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  increase or decrease in interest income 
the company purchases certain inventory from and sells product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where the company purchases inventory or sells product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to the company and the other involved parties
