societ italiana corticosteroidi srl sicor effective november  we entered into a technology transfer and development agreement with sicor 
under the terms of the agreement  sicor agreed to perform a feasibility study and full process development work to produce dm  a component of our tap products 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to pay sicor a stated price for work performed based on achievement of certain milestone events 
on june   we amended the technology transfer and development agreement with sicor 
under the terms of the amendment  sicor also provides preparatory activities in order to scale up the production of ansamitocin p  a precursor to dmx compounds  in anticipation of large scale production of ansamitocin p and dmx compounds to be used in tap compounds for later stage clinical trials and commercialization 
patents  trademarks and trade secrets we seek patent protection for our proprietary technologies  product candidates  and related innovations in the united states  europe  japan and elsewhere 
patents that have been issued to us in the united states include the following claiming a process for the preparation of certain maytansinoids  claiming methods of preparation of conjugates composed of maytansinoids and cell binding agents  claiming composition and use of novel taxanes  claiming conjugates composed of taxanes and cell binding agents  and a method of antibody humanization 
in many cases  we have received comparable patents outside the united states 
we have also submitted additional patent applications in the united states  europe  japan  and elsewhere covering proprietary small drug derivatives  methods of attachment to antibodies  tap compounds  antibody compounds and use of some of these product candidates and inventions for certain diseases 
we expect that our work will also lead to other patent applications 
in all such cases  we will either be the assignee or owner of such patents or have an exclusive license to the technology covered by the patents 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents  if issued  will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products  technologies or processes 
in addition  many of the processes and much of the know how that are important to us depend upon the skills  knowledge and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel  which skills  knowledge and experience are not patentable 
to protect our rights in these areas  we require that all employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that these agreements will provide adequate or any meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or proprietary information 
further  in the absence of patent protection  we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competition we focus on highly competitive areas of product development 
our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology firms 
many of these companies and institutions also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific  research and product development capabilities  as well as greater financial  marketing and human resources than we do 
in addition  many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large  established companies to support the research  development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours 
in particular  competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include the safety and efficacy of products  the timing of regulatory approval and commercial introduction  special regulatory designation of products  such as orphan drug designation  and the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 
our competitive position depends on our ability to develop effective proprietary products  implement clinical development  production and marketing plans  including collaborations with other companies with greater marketing resources than ours  obtain patent protection and secure sufficient capital resources 
continuing development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates 
in addition  monoclonal antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics 
in the future  additional monoclonal antibodies may compete with our product candidates 
because of the prevalence of combination therapy in cancer and the variety of genes and targets implicated in cancer incidence and progression  we believe that products resulting from applications of new technologies may be complementary to our own 
such new technologies include  but are not limited to the use of genomics technology to identify new gene based targets for the development of anticancer drugs  the use of high throughput screening to identify and optimize lead compounds  the use of gene therapy to deliver genes to regulate gene function  and the use of therapeutic vaccines 
regulatory matters our product candidates are regulated in the united states by the fda in accordance with the united states federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as well as the public health service act 
we expect that huc dm  hun dm and other of our tap compounds will be reviewed by the fda s center for drug evaluation and research  or cder 
in addition  each drug manufacturer in the united states must be registered with the fda 
the steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states include performance of preclinical laboratory  animal  and formulation studies  the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  the completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of a new drug application to and its acceptance by the fda  and fda approval of the new drug application  including approval of product labeling and advertising 
even if we  or our partners  obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the company  our products  and the facilities in which our products are manufactured are subject to continual review and periodic inspection 
the fda will require post marketing reporting to monitor the safety of our products 
manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp 
in complying with cgmp  manufacturers must expend funds  time and effort in the areas of production  quality control and recordkeeping to ensure full technical compliance 
the fda stringently applies regulatory standards for manufacturing 
the regulatory considerations that have potential impact on the future marketing of our products are summarized below 
clinical trials process before a new drug may be sold in the united states and other countries  clinical trials of the product must be conducted and the results submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies for approval 
in the united states  these clinical trial programs generally involve a three phase process 
typically  phase i trials are conducted in healthy volunteers to determine the early side effect profile and the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism 
in phase ii  trials are conducted in groups of patients afflicted with the target disease to determine preliminary efficacy and optimal dosages and to expand the safety profile 
in phase iii  large scale comparative trials are conducted in patients with the target disease to provide sufficient data for the proof of efficacy and safety required by federal regulatory agencies 
in the case of drugs for cancer and other life threatening diseases  phase i human testing usually is performed in patients with advanced disease rather than in healthy volunteers 
we intend to conduct clinical trials not only in accordance with fda regulations  but also within guidelines established by other applicable agencies and committees 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
regulatory approval in other countries is obtained through the various regulatory bodies governing pharmaceutical sales in those individual countries 
we intend to rely on foreign licensees to obtain regulatory approvals to market our products in foreign countries 
regulatory approval takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
approval times also depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the severity of the disease in question  the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials 
orphan drug designation the orphan drug act of generally provides incentives to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to undertake development and marketing of products to treat relatively rare diseases or diseases affecting fewer than  persons in the united states at the time of application for orphan drug designation 
we may pursue this designation with respect to products intended for qualifying patient populations 
a drug that receives orphan drug designation and is the first product of its kind to receive fda marketing approval for its product claim is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product claim 
new drugs for serious or life threatening illnesses the fda modernization act allows the designation of fast track status to expedite development of new drugs  including review and approvals  and is intended to speed the availability of new therapies to desperately ill patients 
fast track procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the fda regarding preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval 
we may seek fast track status for some  or all  of our products 
fast track status also incorporates initiatives announced by the president of the united states and the fda commissioner in march intended to provide cancer patients with faster access to new cancer therapies 
one of these initiatives states that the initial basis for approval of anticancer agents to treat refractory  hard to treat cancer may be objective evidence of response  rather than statistically improved disease free and or overall survival  as had been common practice 
the sponsor of a product approved under this accelerated mechanism is required to follow up with further studies on clinical safety and effectiveness in larger groups of patients 
research and development spending during each of the three years ended june   and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
during the year ended june   approximately of our full time equivalent research and development personnel were dedicated to our sanofi aventis collaboration compared to during the years ended june  and employees as of june   we had full time employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities 
eighty four employees hold post graduate degrees  of which hold phd degrees and hold phd degrees 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees  members of the board of directors and consultants 
item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 
if our tap technology does not produce safe  effective and commercially viable products  our business will be severely harmed 
our tap technology yields novel anticancer product candidates for the treatment of cancer 
no tap product candidate has obtained regulatory approval and all of them are in early stages of development 
the most advanced tap product candidates are only in the phase i or phase i ii stage of clinical trials 
our tap product candidates or our collaborators tap product candidates may not prove to be safe  effective or commercially viable treatments for cancer and our tap technology may not result in any future meaningful benefits to us or for our current or potential collaborative partners 
furthermore  we are aware of only one antibody drug conjugate that has obtained fda approval and is based on technology similar to our tap technology 
if our tap technology fails to generate product candidates that are safe  effective and commercially viable treatments for cancer  or fails to obtain fda approval  our business will be severely harmed 
clinical trials for our product candidates will be lengthy and expensive and their outcome is uncertain 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidates  we and our collaborative partners must demonstrate through clinical testing that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans 
conducting clinical trials is a time consuming  expensive and uncertain process and typically requires years to complete 
our most advanced product candidates are only in the phase i or phase i ii stage of clinical trials 
in our industry  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often are not predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
some compounds that have shown promising results in preclinical or early clinical trials subsequently fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
at any time during the clinical trials  we  our collaborative partners  or the fda might delay or halt any clinical trials for our product candidates for various reasons  including occurrence of unacceptable toxicities or side effects  ineffectiveness of the product candidate  insufficient drug supply  negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials  or results that necessitate additional clinical studies  delays in obtaining or maintaining required approvals from institutions  review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites  delays in patient enrollment  or other reasons that are internal to the businesses of our collaborative partners  which they may not share with us 
the results of clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of our product candidates or our collaborators product candidates to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval or to make the commercialization of the product worthwhile 
any failure or substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or our collaborators product candidates could severely harm our business 
if our collaborative partners fail to perform their obligations under our agreements  or determine not to continue with clinical trials for particular product candidates  our business could be severely impacted 
our strategy for the development and commercialization of our product candidates depends  in large part  upon the formation and maintenance of collaborative arrangements 
collaborations provide an opportunity for us to generate cash flow and revenue  offset some of the costs associated with our internal research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  seek and obtain regulatory approvals faster than we could on our own  successfully commercialize existing and future product candidates  gain use of our technology with antibodies that are proprietary to other companies  secure access to targets which  due to intellectual property restrictions  would otherwise be unavailable to our technology 
if we fail to secure or maintain successful collaborative arrangements  the development and marketing of compounds that use our technology may be delayed  scaled back  or otherwise may not occur 
in addition  we may be unable to negotiate other collaborative arrangements or  if necessary  modify our existing arrangements on acceptable terms 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our partners may devote to our products 
our partners may separately pursue competing products  therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborative efforts  or may decide for reasons not known to us to discontinue development of products under our agreements with them 
any of our partners may slow or discontinue the development of a product covered by a collaborative arrangement for reasons that can include a change in the partner s strategic focus as a result of merger  management changes  adverse business events  or other causes  a change in the priority of the product relative to other programs in the collaborator s pipeline  a reassessment of the patent situation related to the compound or its target  a change in the anticipated competition for the product  clinical study results  a reduction in the financial resources the collaborator can or is willing to apply to the development of new compounds and other factors 
even if our partners continue the collaborative arrangements  they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
also  our partners may fail to perform their obligations under the collaborative agreements or may be slow in performing their obligations 
our partners can terminate our collaborative agreements under certain conditions 
the decision to advance a product that is covered by a collaborative agreement through clinical trials and ultimately to commercialization is in the discretion of our collaborative partners 
if any collaborative partner were to terminate or breach our agreements  or fail to complete its obligations to us in a timely manner  our anticipated revenue from the agreement and from the development and commercialization of our products would be severely limited 
if we are not able to establish additional collaborations or any or all of our existing collaborations are terminated and we are not able to enter into alternative collaborations on acceptable terms  our continued development  manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or scaled back as we may not have the funds or capability to continue these activities 
if our collaborators fail to successfully develop and commercialize tap compounds  our business would be severely harmed 
we depend on a small number of collaborators for a substantial portion of our revenue 
the loss of  or a material reduction in activity by  any one of these collaborators could result in a substantial decline in our revenue 
we have and will continue to have collaborations with a limited number of companies 
as a result  our financial performance depends on the efforts and overall success of these companies 
also  the failure of any one of our collaborative partners to perform its obligations under its agreement with us  including making any royalty  milestone or other payments to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
further  any material reduction by any one of our collaborative partners in its level of commitment of resources  funding  personnel  and interest in continued development under its agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if consolidation trends in the healthcare industry continue  the number of our potential collaborators could decrease  which could have an adverse impact on our development efforts 
if a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination  its continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development program could be delayed  diminished or terminated 
if our collaborators requirements for clinical materials to be manufactured by us are significantly lower than we have estimated  our financial results and condition could be adversely affected 
we procure certain components of finished conjugate  including ansamitocin p  dm  dm  and linker  on behalf of our collaborators 
in order to meet our commitments to our collaborators  we are required to enter into agreements with third parties to produce these components well in advance of our production of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
if our collaborators do not require as much clinical material as we have contracted to produce  we may not be able to recover our investment in these components and we may suffer significant losses 
for example  in february  boehringer ingelheim discontinued development of bivatuzumab mertansine and in january  millennium discontinued development of mln in the periods subsequent to discontinuation of development  we can have significantly reduced demand for conjugated material 
specifically  the discontinuation of bivatuzumab mertansine has contributed to the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in the year ended june  in addition  we operate a conjugate manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of the cost of operating this facility  including the cost of manufacturing personnel  is charged to the cost of producing clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
if we produce fewer batches of clinical materials for our collaborators  less of the cost of operating the conjugate manufacturing facility will be charged to our collaborators and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses 
we have generated operating losses since our inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the years ended june    and  we generated losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we may never be profitable 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research  development  preclinical testing  clinical studies and collaborator support activities increase 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our product candidates 
further  we expect to invest significant resources supporting our existing collaborators as they work to develop  test and commercialize tap and other antibody compounds  and we or our collaborators may encounter technological or regulatory difficulties as part of this development and commercialization process that we cannot overcome or remedy 
we may also incur substantial marketing and other costs in the future if we decide to establish marketing and sales capabilities to commercialize our product candidates 
none of our product candidates has generated any commercial revenue and our only revenues to date have been primarily from upfront and milestone payments  research and development support and clinical materials reimbursement from our collaborative partners 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of our product candidates for several years  and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of products 
even if we do successfully develop products that can be marketed and sold commercially  we will need to generate significant revenues from those products to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we and our collaborative partners are subject to extensive government regulations and we and our collaborative partners may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
we and our collaborative partners may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates  which would cause our business to be severely harmed 
pharmaceutical product candidates  including those in development by us and our collaborative partners  are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if our potential products or our collaborators potential products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  complex  expensive and uncertain 
securing fda approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the approval process may take many years to complete and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
in light of the limited regulatory history of monoclonal antibody based therapeutics  regulatory approvals for our products may not be obtained without lengthy delays  if at all 
any fda or other regulatory approvals of our product candidates  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
the effect of government regulation may be to delay marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time  limit the indicated uses for which potential products may be marketed  impose costly requirements on our activities  and place us at a competitive disadvantage to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
failure to comply with fda or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with the fda approval process 
in addition  we are  or may become  subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research work 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business  we may be subject to sanctions  including the temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls  marketing restrictions and civil and criminal penalties 
our product candidates and our collaborators product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with continuing regulations  we could lose these approvals and the sale of our products could be suspended 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate  the approval could be conditioned on us conducting costly post approval studies or could limit the indicated uses included in our labeling 
moreover  the product may later cause adverse effects that limit or prevent its widespread use  force us to withdraw it from the market or impede or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in additional countries 
in addition  the manufacturer of the product and its facilities will continue to be subject to fda review and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to applicable regulations 
after receiving marketing approval  the manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping related to the product remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
we may be slow to adapt  or we may never adapt  to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda and other applicable united states and foreign regulatory authorities  or if previously unknown problems with our products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including restrictions on the products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes  warning letters  civil or criminal penalties  fines  injunctions  product seizures or detentions  import bans  voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications 
we rely on two third party manufacturers to perform separate activities in the process of producing supplies of our cell killing agents  dm and dm significant problems at either of these manufacturers could negatively impact the development of our own compounds and those of our collaborators 
we rely on third party suppliers to manufacture materials used to make tap compounds 
our cell killing agents dm and dm collectively dmx are manufactured from a precursor  ansamitocin p as part of preparing to produce tap compounds for later stage clinical trials and commercialization  we are in the process of transitioning from our original supplier of ansamitocin p to a larger company with more commercial production experience 
we believe we have ample inventory of ansamitocin p in place to meet the anticipated demands by us and our partners during the transition period 
should there be a serious problem with the transition to the new vendor  however  we would not be able to immediately obtain material from our original supplier and our ability to produce tap compounds could be significantly impacted  which may impact our and our collaborators product development activities including clinical testing 
we also use a single supplier to convert ansamitocin p to dmx 
any problems experienced by this vendor could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of dmx to us until this vendor cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
any delay or interruption in our supply of dmx could lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations and preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates and our collaborators product candidates  which could negatively affect our business 
we are currently working with a potential additional supplier to develop the capabilities to supply these materials 
we cannot assume that we will be able to reach agreement with this supplier on acceptable terms  or at all 
unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives applicable to our product candidates could limit our potential product revenue 
antibody based anticancer products are often much more costly to produce than traditional chemotherapeutics and tend to have significantly higher prices 
factors that help justify the price include the high mortality associated with many types of cancer and the need for more and better treatment options 
regulations governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
some countries require approval of the sales price of a drug before it can be marketed 
some countries restrict the physicians that can authorize the use of more expensive medications 
some countries establish treatment guidelines to help limit the use of more expensive therapeutics and the pool of patients that receive them 
in some countries  including the united states  third party payers frequently seek discounts from list prices and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products 
because our product candidates are in the development stage  we do not know the level of reimbursement  if any  we will receive for any products that we are able to successfully develop 
if the reimbursement for any of our product candidates is inadequate in light of our development and other costs  our ability to achieve profitability would be affected 
we believe that the efforts of governments and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and other major healthcare markets have been proposed and adopted in recent years 
for example  the united states congress enacted a limited prescription drug benefit for medicare recipients as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of while the program established by this statute may increase demand for any products that we are able to successfully develop  if we participate in this program  our prices will be negotiated with drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries and are likely to be lower than prices we might otherwise obtain 
non medicare third party drug procurement organizations may also base the price they are willing to pay on the rate paid by drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries 
in addition  ongoing initiatives in the united states have and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing 
the announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product candidate that we may successfully develop 
we may be unable to establish the manufacturing capabilities necessary to develop and commercialize our potential products 
currently  we have only a conjugate manufacturing facility that we use to manufacture conjugated compounds for us and our collaborators for preclinical and initial clinical testing 
we do not currently have the manufacturing capacity needed to make our product candidates for commercial sale 
in addition  our manufacturing capacity may be insufficient to complete all clinical trials contemplated by us and our collaborators over time 
we intend to rely in part on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficiently large quantities of drug materials that are and will be needed for clinical trials and commercialization of our potential products and are putting in place these suppliers 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality of materials 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical trials may be delayed  thereby delaying the submission of product candidates for regulatory approval and the market introduction and subsequent commercialization of our potential products 
any such delays may lower our revenues and potential profitability 
we may develop our manufacturing capacity in part by expanding our current facilities or building new facilities 
either of these activities would require substantial additional funds and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees to staff these facilities 
we may not be able to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to produce drug materials for clinical trials or commercial use 
we and any third party manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of third party manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda will not grant approval to our product candidates 
in complying with these regulations and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort on production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any third party manufacturer with whom we may contract fail to maintain regulatory compliance  we or the third party may be subject to fines and or manufacturing operations may be suspended 
we have only one conjugate manufacturing facility and any prolonged and significant disruption at that facility could impair our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing 
currently  we are contractually obligated to manufacture phase i and non pivotal phase ii clinical products for companies licensing our tap technology 
we manufacture this material in a conjugate manufacturing facility 
we only have one such manufacturing facility in which we can manufacture clinical products 
our current manufacturing facility contains highly specialized equipment and utilizes complicated production processes developed over a number of years that would be difficult  time consuming and costly to duplicate 
any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing on our own and would cause us to seek additional third party manufacturing contracts  thereby increasing our development costs 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses may be excluded under our insurance policies 
certain events  such as natural disasters  fire  political disturbances  sabotage or business accidents  which could impact our current or future facilities  could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product development efforts until such time as we are able to repair our facility or put in place third party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role 
any inability to license from third parties their proprietary technologies or processes which we use in connection with the development and manufacture of our product candidates may impair our business 
other companies  universities and research institutions have or may obtain patents that could limit our ability to use  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates or impair our competitive position 
as a result  we would have to obtain licenses from other parties before we could continue using  manufacturing  marketing or selling our potential products 
any necessary licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain required licenses  we may not be able to market our potential products at all or we may encounter significant delays in product development while we redesign products or methods that are found to infringe on the patents held by others 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we currently have no direct sales or marketing capabilities 
we anticipate relying on third parties to market and sell most of our primary product candidates 
if we decide to market our potential products through a direct sales force  we would need either to hire a sales force with expertise in pharmaceutical sales or to contract with a third party to provide a sales force which meets our needs 
we may be unable to establish marketing  sales and distribution capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our potential products and be competitive 
in addition  co promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize potential products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these potential products  and these third parties may fail to commercialize our compounds successfully 
if our product candidates or those of our collaborators do not gain market acceptance  our business will suffer 
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and other members of the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including their degree of clinical efficacy and safety  their advantage over alternative treatment methods  our the marketer s ability to gain acceptable reimbursement and the reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and the quality of the distribution capabilities for product candidates  both ours and our collaborative partners 
physicians may not prescribe any of our future products until such time as clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of those products as compared to conventional drug and other treatments 
even if the clinical safety and efficacy of therapies using our products is established  physicians may elect not to recommend the therapies for any number of other reasons  including whether the mode of administration of our products is effective for certain conditions  and whether the physicians are already using competing products that satisfy their treatment objectives 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and use any product candidates that we  or our collaborative partners  develop 
if our products do not achieve significant market acceptance and use  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business will be severely harmed 
we may be unable to compete successfully 
the markets in which we compete are well established and intensely competitive 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our failure to compete successfully may result in pricing reductions  reduced gross margins and failure to achieve market acceptance for our potential products 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  and research institutions 
many of these organizations have substantially more experience and more capital  research and development  regulatory  manufacturing  sales  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may develop products that are safer or more effective than our product candidates  obtain fda and other regulatory approvals or reach the market with their products more rapidly than we can  reducing the potential sales of our product candidates  devote greater resources to market or sell their products  adapt more quickly to new technologies and scientific advances  initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can  have greater success in recruiting skilled scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent  more effectively negotiate third party licensing and collaboration arrangements  and take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently developing products targeting the same types of cancer that we target  and some of our competitors products have entered clinical trials or already are commercially available 
in addition  our product candidates  if approved and commercialized  will compete against well established  existing  therapeutic products that are currently reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations 
we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for relationships with academic and research institutions  and for licenses to proprietary technology 
in addition  we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets and as scientific developments surrounding antibody based therapeutics for cancer continue to accelerate 
while we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive  research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  the value of our technology and our product candidates could be diminished 
our success depends in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field in which we operate is still evolving  is surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty and involves complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
accordingly  our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
although we own several patents  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
through litigation  a third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance 
also  patents and applications owned or licensed by us may become the subject of interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention that could result in substantial cost to us 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in our loss of rights under a patent or patent application 
it is unclear how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them or if they are challenged in court or in other proceedings 
a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or a challenge could result in limitations of the patents coverage 
in addition  the cost of litigation or interference proceedings to uphold the validity of patents can be substantial 
if we are unsuccessful in these proceedings  third parties may be able to use our patented technology without paying us licensing fees or royalties 
moreover  competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation 
to prevent infringement or unauthorized use  we may need to file infringement claims  which are expensive and time consuming 
in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid 
even if the validity of our patents were upheld  a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the ground that its activities are not covered by our patents 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition to our patent rights  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets  know how and confidential information 
third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets  know how and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and corporate partners to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment  consulting or collaborative relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  they may not provide adequate remedies 
if we are forced to litigate or undertake other proceedings in order to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prohibited from commercializing our potential products 
patent litigation is very common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
third parties may assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our technologies  products or other matters 
any claims that might be brought against us alleging to infringement of patents may cause us to incur significant expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  may cause us to pay substantial damages and limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation would be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
furthermore  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property unless we enter into royalty or license agreements 
there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes 
in addition  we sometimes undertake research and development with respect to potential products even when we are aware of third party patents that may be relevant to our potential products  on the basis that such patents may be challenged or licensed by us 
if our subsequent challenge to such patents were not to prevail  we may not be able to commercialize our potential products after having already incurred significant expenditures unless we are able to license the intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 
we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we were able to obtain licenses to such technology  some licenses may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations  which could severely harm our business 
we use hazardous materials in our business  and any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could harm our business 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws in the future 
failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and the revocation of permits  which could prevent us from conducting our business 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our product candidates during testing or after approval entails an inherent risk of adverse effects  which could expose us to product liability claims 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product  injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  costs of litigation  distraction of management  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
we may not have sufficient resources to satisfy any liability resulting from these claims 
we currently have million of product liability insurance for products which are in clinical testing 
this coverage may not be adequate in scope to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim 
further  we may not be able to maintain our current insurance or obtain general product liability insurance on reasonable terms and at an acceptable cost if we or our collaborative partners begin commercial production of our proposed product candidates 
this insurance  even if we can obtain and maintain it  may not be sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
we depend on our key personnel and we must continue to attract and retain key employees and consultants 
we depend on our key scientific and management personnel 
our ability to pursue the development of our current and future product candidates depends largely on retaining the services of our existing personnel and hiring additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development 
we will also need to hire personnel with expertise in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and finance 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
failure to retain our existing key management and scientific personnel or to attract additional highly qualified personnel could delay the development of our product candidates and harm our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed  we may have to delay or scale back some of our programs or grant rights to third parties to develop and market our products 
we will continue to expend substantial resources developing new and existing product candidates  including costs associated with research and development  acquiring new technologies  conducting preclinical and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products as well as providing certain support to our collaborators in the development of their products 
we believe that our current working capital and future payments  if any  from our collaboration arrangements  including committed research funding that we expect to receive from sanofi aventis pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement  will be sufficient to meet our current and projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next two to three years 
however  we may need additional financing sooner due to a number of factors including if either we or any of our collaborators incur higher than expected costs or experience slower than expected progress in developing product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals  lower revenues than expected under our collaboration agreements  or acquisition of technologies and other business opportunities that require financial commitments 
additional funding may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative arrangements or other arrangements 
debt financing  if available  may involve covenants that could restrict our business activities 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to internally develop and market 
if we are required to grant such rights  the ultimate value of these product candidates to us may be reduced 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly and results announced by us and our collaborators can cause our stock price to decline 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly due to business developments announced by us and by our collaborators  as a result of market trends and as a result of our low stock price 
the business developments that could impact our stock price include disclosures related to clinical findings with compounds that make use of our tap technology  new partnerships  and clinical advancement or discontinuation of product candidates that make use of our tap technology 
our stock price can also fluctuate significantly with the level of overall investment interest in small cap biotechnology stocks 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenue is unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of non recurring licensing fees  decisions of our collaborative partners with respect to our agreements with them  reimbursement for manufacturing services  the achievement of milestones and our receipt of the related milestone payments under new and existing licensing and collaboration agreements 
revenue historically recognized under our prior collaboration agreements may not be an indicator of revenue from any future collaborations 
in addition  our expenses are unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  which may include obligations to manufacture or supply product or payments owed by us under licensing or collaboration agreements 
it is possible that our quarterly operating results will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not good indicators of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  shareholders will have to rely on appreciation in our stock price  if any  in order to achieve a gain on an investment

item selected financial data the following table in thousands  except per share data sets forth our consolidated financial data for each of our five fiscal years through our fiscal year ended june  the information set forth below should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
year ended june  statement of operations data total revenues total expenses other income  net income tax expense net loss basic and diluted net loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding consolidated balance sheet data total assets stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since the company s inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
the combination of our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology has resulted in the development of both proprietary product candidates and technologies 
our proprietary tumor activated prodrug  or tap  technology combines extremely potent small molecule cytotoxic agents with monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to cancer cells 
our tap technology is designed to increase the potency of tumor targeting antibodies and kill cancer cells with only modest damage to healthy tissue 
the cytotoxic agents we use in our tap compounds currently involved in clinical testing are the maytansinoid dm and dm molecules  chemical derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer to develop other types of therapeutics  such as naked antibody anticancer product candidates 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates containing their antibodies 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
we are reimbursed our fully burdened costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and  under certain collaborative agreements  the reimbursement includes a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include amgen  inc formerly abgenix  inc  biogen idec  boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  centocor  inc  genentech  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  and the sanofi aventis group  and most recently  biotest ag effective july  
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
in july  we announced a discovery  development and commercialization collaboration with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc now the sanofi aventis group 
under the terms of this agreement  in consideration of an upfront payment of million sanofi aventis gained commercialization rights to three of the then most advanced product candidates in our preclinical pipeline and the commercialization rights to certain new product candidates developed during the research program portion of the collaboration 
this collaboration allows us to access sanofi aventis clinical development and commercialization capabilities 
under the terms of the sanofi aventis agreement  we also are entitled to receive committed research funding of approximately million during the initial three year term of the research program ending august  in august  sanofi aventis exercised its contractual right to extend the term of its research program with the company and committed to fund million in research support over the twelve months beginning september  this funding is in addition to the research support already committed for the three years ending august  should sanofi aventis elect to exercise its contractual right to extend the term of the research program for the second additional month period  we would receive additional research funding 
on january   genentech notified us that the trastuzumab dm investigational new drug ind application submitted by genentech to the fda had become effective 
under the terms of the may exclusive license agreement for antibodies to her  this event triggered a million milestone payment 
on january   millennium pharmaceuticals  inc notified us that  as part of its ongoing portfolio management process and based on the evaluation of recent clinical data in the context of other opportunities in its pipeline  millennium had decided not to continue the development of its mln compound 
mln consists of a millennium antibody to the prostate specific membrane antigen psma and our dm and was in development by millennium under a license that gave millennium exclusive rights to use our maytansinoid tap technology with antibodies targeting psma 
millennium retains its right to use our maytansinoid tap technology with antibodies targeting psma 
on march   millennium extended the agreement that provides millennium with certain rights to test our tap technology with antibodies to specific targets and to license the right to use the technology to develop products on the terms defined in the agreement 
this agreement was scheduled to expire march  unless extended by millennium 
it is now scheduled to expire march  in consideration for this extension  millennium paid us an extension fee equal to  in august  vernalis completed its acquisition of british biotech 
in connection with this acquisition  the merged company  called vernalis plc  announced that it intended to review its merged product candidate portfolio  including its collaboration with immunogen on hun dm after discussion with vernalis  in january we announced that we would take over further development of the product candidate 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement executed on january   vernalis retained responsibility for the conduct and expense of the study it initiated in the united states study until june   and the study it had started in the united kingdom study through completion 
we took over responsibility for study on july  and  in september  we announced the initiation of our own clinical trial with hun dm in multiple myeloma study 
on december   we executed an agreement to amend the residual obligation terms of the january  termination agreement with vernalis 
under the terms of the amendment  we assumed responsibility for study as of december   including the cost of its completion 
under the amendment  vernalis paid us  in consideration of the expected cost of the obligations assumed by us with the amendment 
this  has been recognized as other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june on january   we announced that we intended to advance cantuzumab mertansine into human testing to assess the clinical utility of the compound in certain indications 
in october  we decided to move huc dm into clinical trials instead of cantuzumab mertansine huc dm 
we initiated a phase i clinical trial with huc dm in june based upon the results of our clinical trials  if and when they are completed  we will evaluate whether to continue clinical development of hun dm and huc dm  and  if so  whether we will seek a collaborative partner or partners to continue the clinical development and commercialization of either or both of these compounds 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate that we will have a commercially approved product within the near future 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly in the near term as we continue our development efforts  including an expanded clinical trial program 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaboration payments  including the committed research funding due us under the sanofi aventis collaboration over the remainder of the research program  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next two to three fiscal years 
we anticipate that the increase in total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments and the committed research funding to which we are entitled pursuant to the sanofi aventis collaboration 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we estimate the period of our significant involvement during development for each of our collaborative agreements 
we recognize any upfront fees received from our collaborators ratably over this estimated period of significant involvement 
we generally believe our period of significant involvement occurs between the date we sign a collaboration agreement and projected fda approval of our collaborator s product that is the subject of the collaboration agreement 
we estimate that this time period ranges between six and seven and one half years  depending on the characteristics of the license 
the actual period of our involvement could differ significantly based upon the results of our collaborators preclinical and clinical trials  competitive products that are introduced into the market and the general uncertainties surrounding drug development 
any difference between our estimated period of involvement during development and our actual period of involvement could have a material effect upon our results of operations 
we assess our period of significant involvement with each collaboration on a quarterly basis and adjust the period of involvement prospectively  as appropriate 
we recognize the million upfront fee we received from sanofi aventis ratably over our estimated period of significant involvement of five years 
this estimated period includes the initial three year term of the collaborative research program  the one month extension sanofi aventis exercised in august  and one remaining month extension that sanofi aventis may exercise 
in the event our period of involvement is less than we estimated  the remaining deferred balance of the upfront fee will be recognized over this shorter period 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of dm and dm  collectively referred to as dmx  and ansamitocin p in excess of month projected usage that is not supported by collaborators firm fixed orders and projections to be excess 
to date  we have fully reserved any such material identified as excess with a corresponding charge to research and development expense 
our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and maximum tolerated dose of each clinical trial 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual month usage of dmx and ansamitocin p varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
in the fiscal year we did not incur any research and development expenses related to ansamitocin p and dmx inventory that we identified as excess based upon our inventory policy  and we recorded  to write down certain p and dmx batches and certain work in process amounts to their net realizable value 
stock compensation as of june   the company has one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc restated stock option plan 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement r  share based payment statement r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement as defined below  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
such amounts have been reduced by the company s estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of the company s stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as the company does not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst its employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the united states treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
the compensation cost that has been incurred during the year ended june  is million 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million decrease in revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower revenues from clinical materials reimbursement  partially offset by higher revenues from research development support  as well as increases in license and milestone fees  as discussed below 
the million increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher revenues from clinical materials reimbursement and research and development support  as well as increases in license and milestone fees 
research and development support was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent committed research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  as well as amounts earned for resources utilized under our development and license agreements with biogen idec  centocor  and genentech 
the sanofi aventis agreement provides that we are entitled to receive a minimum of million of committed research funding during a three year research program  with annual amounts to be determined in each of the three research program years 
we entered into the agreement with sanofi aventis in july and initiation of the committed research funding began on september  at the conclusion of the second sanofi aventis research program year on august   a review of research activities during this period was conducted 
this review identified million in billable activities performed under the program during the fiscal year ended june  which had not been billed or recorded as revenue 
accordingly  we have included this additional million of research and development support revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  also included in research and development support revenue are fees related to process development and research work performed by the company on behalf of collaborators  as well as samples of research grade material shipped to collaborators 
to date  our development fees represent the fully burdened reimbursement of costs incurred in producing research grade materials and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators products and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased approximately  to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million related to the achievement of a milestone under the genentech agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of trastuzumab dm  along with amounts earned under the three year renewal of the broad access agreement with genentech 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million related to the achievement of milestones under the sanofi aventis agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of ave and for the preclinical advancement of sar total revenue recognized from license and milestone fees from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  collaborative partner amgen formerly abgenix biogen idec boehringer ingelheim centocor genentech millennium sanofi aventis vernalis total deferred revenue of million at june  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements with them  which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
clinical materials reimbursement decreased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of the hun dm  bivatuzumab mertansine  mln  trastuzumab dm and ave clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials in support of the development efforts of certain other collaborators 
the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal is due to a reduction in demand primarily related to clinical material to support the boehringer ingelheim and millennium programs 
the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to the advancement of the clinical trials of bivatuzumab mertansine and mln  along with the initiation of clinical trials of ave under certain collaborative agreements  we are reimbursed for our fully burdened cost to produce clinical materials plus a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed  is directly related to i the number of on going clinical trials our collaborators have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and ii our production of clinical grade material on behalf of our collaborators  either in anticipation of clinical trials  or for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses we report research and development expense net of certain reimbursements we receive from our collaborators 
our net research and development expenses relate to i research to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic drugs  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas activities pursuant to our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  activities related to the preclinical and clinical development of hun dm and huc dm  process development related to production of the hun antibody and hun dm conjugate for clinical materials  process development related to production of the huc antibody and huc dm conjugate for clinical materials  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  funded development activities with contract manufacturers for the hun antibody  the huc antibody  and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing plant  process improvements to our tap technology  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and in licensed antibody candidates  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents 
dm and dm are the cytotoxic agents that we currently use in the manufacture of our two tap product candidates in clinical testing 
we have also investigated the viability of other maytansinoid effector molecules  which  collectively with dm and dm  we refer to as dmx 
in order to make commercial manufacture of dmx conjugates viable  we have devoted substantial resources to improving the strain of the microorganism that produces ansamitocin p  the precursor to dmx  to enhance manufacturing yields 
we also continue to devote considerable resources to improve other dmx manufacturing processes 
on january   we announced that pursuant to the terms and conditions of a termination agreement between us and vernalis  vernalis relinquished its rights to develop and commercialize hun dm as a result  we regained the rights to develop and commercialize hun dm under the terms of our january  termination agreement with vernalis  we assumed responsibility of one of the studies underway with the compound  study  on july  since then  we have expanded this study based upon the data from the initial patients enrolled and have expanded the number of clinical centers participating in this study to expedite patient enrollment 
additionally  we initiated a phase i clinical trial with hun dm in cd positive multiple myeloma study in september on december   we executed an amendment to the january  termination agreement with vernalis 
under the terms of the amendment  we assumed responsibility as of december   at our own expense  to complete the hun dm clinical study study that had been initiated in the united kingdom 
vernalis paid us  in consideration of the expected cost of the obligations assumed by us under the amendment 
such consideration is included in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june  we intend to evaluate whether to out license all or part of the development and commercial rights to this compound as we move through the clinical trial process 
in january  we announced that we planned to advance cantuzumab mertansine  or an improved version of the compound  into a clinical trial that we would manage 
in october  we decided to move forward in developing a modified version of cantuzumab mertansine which we call huc dm patient dosing was initiated for the phase i study of huc dm in june we intend to evaluate whether to out license all or part of the development and commercial rights to this compound as we move through the clinical trial process for this compound 
in fiscal  we licensed the then three most advanced product candidates in our preclinical portfolio to sanofi aventis under the terms of our discovery  development and commercialization collaboration 
these three product candidates were an anti cd tap compound for acute myeloid leukemia ave  an anti igf r antibody ave  and an anti cd tap compound sar for certain b cell malignancies 
additional compounds were also licensed to sanofi aventis under this agreement 
in december  sanofi aventis filed an investigational new drug application ind for ave clinical testing of this compound was initiated in march the anti igf r antibody is a naked antibody directed against a target found on various solid tumors  including certain breast  lung and prostate cancers 
at june   pursuant to our collaboration research program with sanofi aventis  we have identified a lead antibody product candidate and sanofi aventis is performing further advancement of this antibody 
the third potential product candidate is directed at certain anti cd b cell malignancies  including non hodgkin s lymphoma  and is in preclinical development 
additional compounds also are in various stages of development 
during the term of our research collaboration with sanofi aventis  we are required to propose for inclusion in the collaborative research program certain antibodies or antibody targets that we believe will have utility in oncology  with the exception of those antibodies or antibody targets that are the subject of our preexisting or future collaboration and license agreements 
sanofi aventis then has the right to either include in or exclude from the collaborative research program these proposed antibodies and antibody targets 
if sanofi aventis elects to exclude any antibodies or antibody targets  we may elect to develop the products for our own pipeline 
furthermore  sanofi aventis may only include a certain number of antibody targets in the research program at any one time 
sanofi aventis must therefore exclude any proposed antibody or antibody target in excess of the agreed upon number 
over the original  three year term of the research program and agreed upon one year extension  we will receive a minimum of million of committed research funding and will devote a significant amount of our internal research and development resources to advancing the research program 
under the terms of the agreement  we may advance any tap or antibody products that sanofi aventis has elected not to either initially include or later advance in the research program 
the potential product candidates that have been or that may eventually be excluded from the sanofi aventis collaboration are in an early stage of discovery research and we are unable to accurately estimate which potential products  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery research stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other things  the clinical indications  the timing  size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  the number of our research and development personnel increased to for the year ended june  compared to at june  we had research and development personnel for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the year ended june  is million of stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r on july  facilities expense  including depreciation  increased million during the year ended june  as compared to the same period in and increased million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the increase in facilities expense in and was principally due to the addition of two manufacturing suites placed in service during also contributing to the increase in was an increase in administrative expenses primarily resulting from increased rent for the facilities  real estate taxes and operating expenses  and higher utility costs 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase as we expand our clinical trial activity 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations research research includes expenses associated with activities to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic agents for our products and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased million to million in and increased million to million in the increase in research expenses in both and was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the increase in salaries and related expenses was the result of an increase in personnel required to support our collaborators research programs  along with compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r as of july preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased million to million in and million to million in the increases in and are substantially due to an increase in salaries and related expense  the result of an increase in personnel to support both our own as well as our collaborators preclinical and clinical activities  along with compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r as of july  clinical trial costs increased in and due to the advancement of our own clinical programs 
also contributing to the increase in was an increase in contract services for certain preclinical studies related to huc dm process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased approximately  to million in and increased approximately  to million in the increases in and are primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses due to increases in personnel to support our own as well as our collaborators development activities  along with compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r as of july  manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own product candidates and costs to support the operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing plant 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our preclinical and clinical trials  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing costs related to the production of material for our collaborators are recorded as cost of clinical material reimbursed in our statement of operations 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in and increased million to million in the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of i an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel to support both our own as well as our collaborators preclinical and clinical activities  along with compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r as of july   ii an increase in contract service expense substantially due to higher antibody purchases as well as development costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the potential production of later stage materials  iii lower overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators  iv an increase in facilities expense related to the addition of two manufacturing suites that were placed into service during the prior fiscal year  and v an increase in administrative expense resulting primarily from increases in freight in  electricity  and recruiting fees 
partially offsetting these increases was the use of material that was reserved in prior fiscal years 
the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of i an increase in salaries and related expenses  ii an increase in expenses to reserve for excess quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx in accordance with our inventory reserve policy  iii an increase in facilities expense related to the addition of two manufacturing suites that were placed into service during the year and iv lower overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
antibody expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials was million in  million in and million in approximately  of the antibody expense during was related to the purchase of antibody in support of one of the preclinical product candidates that was licensed by sanofi aventis 
we received reimbursement of this amount in from sanofi aventis 
the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  amounts incurred related to antibody production have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
during fiscal and  we recorded research and development expenses of million and  respectively  related to ansamitocin p and dmx inventory that we identified as excess based upon our inventory policy 
we did not incur any similar expenses in fiscal the higher write off in as compared to contributed to the increase in manufacturing operations expense in  as noted above 
reserve requirements for excess quantities of p and dmx are principally determined based on our collaborators forecasted demand compared to our inventory position 
due to lead times required to secure material and the changing requirements of our collaborators  expenses to provide for excess quantities have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
see inventory within our critical accounting policies for further discussion of our inventory reserve policy 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
the increases in both years primarily relate to increases in salaries and related expenses  and expanded patent filings 
salaries and related expenses increased due to an increase in personnel  along with compensation costs incurred with the adoption of sfas r as of july  interest income interest income for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  interest income for the year ended june  was million 
the increase in interest income from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result higher rates of return resulting from higher yields on investments 
net realized losses on investments net realized losses on investments were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the net realized losses in   and are attributable to the timing of investment sales 
other income other income for the year ended june  increased  to  as compared to  for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recorded as other income  for consideration of the expected cost of the obligations assumed by us resulting from the amendment to the january  termination agreement executed by us and vernalis 
under the terms of the amendment  we assumed responsibility as of december   at our own expense  to complete study for hun dm offsetting this amount  we incurred foreign currency translation expense related to obligations with non united states dollar based suppliers 
other income for the year ended june  was million 
during the year ended june   we recorded in other income reimbursement of approximately million from sanofi aventis for the gmp production of antibody manufactured in support of one of the preclinical product candidates that was licensed by sanofi aventis 
liquidity and capital resources june  in thousands cash and short term investments working capital stockholders equity cash flows we require cash to fund our operating expenses  including the advancement of our own clinical programs  and to make capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through equity financings in public markets and payments from our collaborators  including equity investments  license fees and research funding 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for all periods presented was to fund our net loss 
the increase in operational cash use from fiscal to fiscal is principally due to the increased net loss  as a result of increased research and development costs and general and administrative expenses compared to last year  without the benefit of the reduction in working capital that occurred in fiscal the decrease in operational cash use from fiscal to fiscal is substantially due to a reduction in working capital that partially offset our fiscal net loss 
also contributing to the decrease in fiscal was million of upfront fees received for which revenue recognition was deferred 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended june   and represents cash inflows from the sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures 
net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended june  and represents cash outflows for capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended june  and primarily represents cash inflows from the sale and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year ended june   consisted primarily of laboratory equipment 
for the year ended june   capital expenditures consisted primarily of capacity and capability expansion at our existing conjugate manufacturing facility located in norwood  massachusetts 
for the year ended june   capital expenditures consisted primarily of the renovation of our new laboratory and office facility at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
net cash provided by financing activities was million   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  which represents the proceeds from the exercise of   and  stock options  respectively 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaborator payments  including committed research funding that we expect to receive from sanofi aventis pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next two to three fiscal years 
we believe that our existing capital resources in addition to our established collaborative agreements will provide funding sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations under all collaborative agreements while also allowing us to develop product candidates and technologies not covered by collaborative agreements 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be received 
should we not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes the distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  although we continue to evaluate the application of sfas no 
 we do not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this includes tax positions considered to be routine as well as those with a high degree of uncertainty 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two is only addressed if step one has been satisfied ie  the position is more likely than not to be sustained 
under step two  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is used in sfas ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than percent 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions 
additionally  fin requires expanded disclosure requirements  which include a tabular rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
these disclosures are required at each annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
we do not believe the adoption will have material impact on our results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
