for its us reinsurance activities  aspen re has established and must retain a multi beneficiary us trust fund for the benefit of its us cedents so that they are able to take financial statement credit without the need to post cedent specific security 
the minimum trust fund amount is million plus an amount equal to of aspen re s us reinsurance liabilities  which were million and million at december  and  respectively 
aspen re intends to apply for trusteed reinsurer approvals in states where us cedents are domiciled 
aspen re is also writing surplus lines business in certain states of the united states where it has obtained the applicable approvals or eligibilities 
in certain us jurisdictions  in order to obtain surplus lines approvals and eligibilities  a company must first be included on the quarterly listing of alien insurers quarterly listing that is maintained by the international insurers department iid of the naic 
pursuant to the iid requirements  aspen re has established a us surplus lines trust fund with a us bank to secure us surplus lines policies 
the initial minimum trust fund amount is million 
in subsequent years  aspen re must add an amount equal to of its us surplus lines liabilities  as at year end and certified by an actuary  subject to the current maximum of million 
the balance held in the trust at december  was million 
in october  the naic s surplus lines task force released a proposal to increase the size of us surplus lines trust funds for companies that currently maintain funds at the maximum level of million 
the naic s proposal would not alter aspen re s surplus lines trust fund requirement 
applications for state surplus lines approvals and eligibilities will be required in certain jurisdictions 
as with the iid  certain jurisdictions require annual requalification filings 
such filings customarily include financial and related information  updated national and state specific business plans  descriptions of reinsurance programs  updated officers and directors biographical affidavits and similar information 
apart from the financial and related filings required to maintain aspen re s place on the quarterly listing and its jurisdiction specific approvals and eligibilities  aspen re generally will not be subject to regulation by us jurisdictions 
specifically  rate and form regulations otherwise applicable to authorized insurers will generally not apply to aspen re s surplus lines transactions 
similarly  us solvency regulation tools including risk based capital standards  investment limitations  credit for reinsurance and holding company filing requirements otherwise applicable to authorized insurers do not generally apply to alien surplus lines insurers such as aspen re 
item a 
risk factors we outline below factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this report and other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
however  these are the risks our management believes to be material 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our future business or results of operations 
any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to recent events uncertainty arising from estimated losses related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma may further impact our financial results 
as of december   the total impact before tax of our expected losses relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and net of reinstatement premiums and potential receipts under our cat swap before tax associated with these hurricanes was recorded at million 
accordingly  losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma materially negatively impacted our year end results and our shareholders equity 
our estimates above are based on limited information available to date from brokers and their evaluations to date  initial loss indications to date  current industry loss estimates  output from industry and proprietary models and a review of in force contracts  each of which basis is subject to change to reflect future information 
we continue to substantially rely on estimates to project our total retained and gross losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma as we have received a limited number of actual reported claims 
in addition to being limited in number  the preliminary notifications submitted by our insurance clients are also subject to significant change depending on actual claims received from their insureds 
actual losses may vary materially from these estimates 
our estimates are uncertain because of the extremely complex and unique causation and coverage issues associated with the unprecedented nature of these events  including the attribution of losses to wind or flood damage or other perils such as fire  business interruption or riot and civil commotion 
in addition  these estimates may vary due to potential legal and regulatory developments related to allocation of losses  as well as inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials due in part to the size and proximity in time and distance of the three hurricanes 
we expect that these issues may be subject to litigation by state attorneys general and private parties and will not be resolved for a considerable period of time 
our retrocessional coverage may be exhausted if our losses from the hurricanes deteriorate and our retrocessional coverage may be exhausted if catastrophes or other events causing large losses occur in we had in place for and we have in place for various retrocessional reinsurance contracts protecting our property reinsurance and specialty reinsurance lines of business 
in most cases these contracts provide following a first loss for one reinstatement of the limit recoverable under the contract 
based on our current losses from hurricane katrina  we will have exhausted the first limit of coverage of all of these contracts  which means our results of operations are more sensitive to future adverse development in relation to these losses 
based on our current losses from hurricanes rita and wilma  we have reinsurance coverage remaining available 
in addition  if catastrophes or other events causing large losses occur in  we may exhaust our retrocessional coverage 
we cannot be sure that retrocessional coverage will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  for the remainder of or for future accident years 
our risk exposure will be materially greater due to higher loss limits and less risk diversity  and our underwriting capacity will be restricted  if we cannot purchase retrocessional coverage 
risks related to our company if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be significantly adversely affected 
our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure 
to the extent actual claims exceed our expectations  we will be required to immediately recognize the less favorable experience 
this could cause a material increase in our provisions for liabilities and a reduction in our profitability  including operating losses and reduction of capital 
to date  overall  we have not been required to make any of these adjustments 
it is expected that in the future  the number of claims will increase  and their size and severity could exceed our expectations 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
our current loss reserves are based on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of ibnr claims  based on facts and circumstances then known  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claim frequency and severity and variable factors such as inflation 
we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish appropriate loss reserves 
each of our insurance subsidiaries reserving process and methodology are subject to a quarterly review  the results of which are presented to and reviewed by our audit committee 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
the inherent uncertainties of loss reserves generally are greater for the reinsurance business as compared to the insurance business  principally due to the necessary reliance on the ceding company or insurer for information regarding losses  and the lapse of time from the occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss to the reinsurer and the ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss 
in addition  although we conduct our due diligence on the transactions we underwrite in connection with our reinsurance business  we are also dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding clients may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
accordingly  actual claims and loss expenses paid will likely deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements incorporated herein by reference 
see above  risks related to recent events 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the occurrence of catastrophic events such as natural disasters 
as a part of our insurance and reinsurance operations  we have assumed substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural disasters and other catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  floods  tornadoes  and fires 
see above  risks related to recent events 
the incidence and severity of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
the occurrence of large claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business 
in particular  we write a considerable amount of business that is exposed to us hurricanes and windstorms and california earthquakes 
this volatility is compounded by accounting regulations that do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences per year in the future and that climate change may increase the frequency of severe weather events 
in  three major hurricanes made landfall in the united states and caused substantial damage 
although we will attempt to manage our exposure to these events  a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones or the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
events that are driven by us hurricanes and windstorms or earthquakes in california in particular could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  such that we must pay losses that exceed a specified retention 
in addition  we limit program size for each client and purchase reinsurance for our own account 
in the case of proportional reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner we intend 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
as a result of the risks we insure and reinsure  unforeseen events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
if actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations  our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of our contracts  particularly within our property reinsurance segment  are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write on a renewal basis because of pricing conditions  our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a larger number of reinsurance contacts are subject to renewal 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that are more difficult than those made in a more mature company because we have more limited annual historical information through december  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies  risk transfer swap and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are more difficult to make than those made for a more mature company because we have more limited annual historical information through december  a significant part of our current loss reserves is in respect of ibnr 
this ibnr reserve is based almost entirely on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs 
in addition to limited historical information  we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish loss reserves 
accordingly  actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our purchase of reinsurance subjects us to third party credit risk and such reinsurance may not be available on favorable terms 
we purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of certain large and multiple losses upon our financial condition 
following the large losses resulting from the hurricanes  our levels of reinsurance recoverables owed to us from our reinsurers has materially increased 
these reinsurers are dependent on their ratings in order to continue to write business  and a few have recently suffered downgrades in ratings as a result of their exposure to the hurricanes 
a reinsurer s insolvency  its inability to continue to write business or its reluctance to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to the reinsured 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as is typical in our industry  many of our reinsurance contracts have a one year term  and it is not certain that they can be renewed on reasonable terms 
for example  following the hurricanes in the united states  reinsurance and retrocessional markets generally became less attractive for purchasers of reinsurance as supply contracted  terms were tightened and premium rates increased significantly 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amount of retrocession protection on terms that are acceptable to us from entities with a satisfactory credit rating 
we would be forced to seek alternative ways of reducing our risk 
our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection for our own account could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
in addition  we are unable to predict the extent to which the courts may expand the theory of liability under a casualty insurance contract  such as the range of the occupational hazards causing losses under employers liability insurance 
in particular  our exposure to casualty reinsurance and uk liability insurance increases our potential exposure to this risk due to the uncertainties of expanded theories of liability and the long tail nature of these lines of business 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our concentration on a limited number of lines of business could make us more susceptible to unfavorable market conditions 
we have a portfolio of business that is currently focused on a relatively limited number of property and casualty lines of business 
given this reliance  there is risk that unfavorable market conditions in these lines could have a disproportionate impact on our company in comparison with our industry in general 
the aggregated risks associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
in our reinsurance business  we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under most reinsurance treaties 
this is common among reinsurers 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political unrest  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may have substantial exposure to large  unexpected losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
although we may attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages we write  we may not be successful in doing so 
for example  we generally exclude acts of terrorism and losses stemming from nuclear  biological and chemical events  however  some states in the united states do not permit exclusion of fires following terrorist attacks from insurance policies and reinsurance treaties 
where we believe we are able to obtain pricing that adequately covers our exposure  we have written a limited number of reinsurance contracts covering solely the peril of terrorism 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of these events with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate 
to the extent that losses from these risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more principal employees or by an inability to attract and retain staff 
our success will depend in substantial part upon our ability to retain our principal employees and to attract additional employees 
as of december   we had employees and  accordingly  depend upon them for the generation and servicing of our business 
we rely substantially upon the services of our senior management team 
in particular  we rely substantially upon the service of paul myners  chairman of our board of directors  christopher o kane  our chief executive officer  and julian cusack  our chief financial officer 
although we have employment agreements with all of the members of our management team and we are not aware of any planned departures or retirements  if we were to lose the services of members of our management team our business could be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
from time to time  we may need to hire additional employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in april  the bermuda government announced a policy limiting the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees 
only three members of aspen bermuda s management team or other officers based in bermuda are bermudian 
as of december   we had employees in bermuda 
two of these employees are julian cusack  our chief financial officer  and james few  our head of property reinsurance 
julian cusack and james few are both non bermudian and are working under work permits that will expire in march in  we recruited and continue to recruit additional employees to work in bermuda for the company or aspen bermuda 
none of our current bermuda employees for whom we have applied for a work permit has been denied 
it is possible that we could lose the services of julian cusack  james few or another key employee who is non bermudian if we were unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified independent directors in the increasingly regulated corporate governance environment 
we are subject to the independent director requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act  sec rules and  to the extent applicable  the nyse corporate governance rules 
we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified independent directors to respond to the increasing regulation of public companies 
if we lose our status as a foreign private issuer and are unable to attract or retain a sufficient number of independent directors  we may be faced with the delisting of our ordinary shares or a violation of the sarbanes oxley act or sec rules 
our insurance subsidiaries are rated by am best  s p and moody s  and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by any of am best  moody s or s p  our competitive position in the insurance industry would suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products and to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements 
a downgrade also may require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their insurance and reinsurance contracts with us 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation 
s p maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
moody s maintains a letter and number scale rating system ranging from aaa exceptional to c lowest 
the objective of am best s  s p s and moody s rating systems is generally to provide an opinion of an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders 
these ratings reflect am best s  s p s and moody s opinions of the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries  they are not evaluations directed to investors in our ordinary shares and other securities and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our ordinary shares and other securities 
as of february   our insurance subsidiaries are rated as follows

following the hurricanes  am best  s p and moody s placed the financial strength rating of aspen re and aspen bermuda and our credit rating on creditwatch 
subsequently  am best and s p affirmed the financial strength ratings of aspen re and aspen bermuda as well our credit rating  with a negative outlook 
moody s also affirmed our ratings with a stable outlook 
the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of  am best  s p and or moody s 
if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by any of am best  s p or moody s  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer  and it would be more difficult for us to sell our products 
as a result  any downgrade may materially and adversely impact our business  results of operations and our liquidity and financial flexibility 
in addition  several agreements we have with third parties would be impacted by a failure to maintain specified ratings 
under our credit facilities  we would be in default if aspen re s or aspen bermuda s insurer financial strength ratings fall below b by am best or a by s p 
under the framework agreement dated may  among wellington and its affiliates  aspen uk services and aspen holdings  aspen re would need to provide a letter of credit with respect to any quota share reinsurance it provides to syndicate if aspen re s insurer financial strength or similar rating is downgraded below a by either s p and am best or such lower rating not being lower than a acceptable to lloyd s from time to time 
also  a downgrade of the financial strength rating of aspen re  aspen bermuda or aspen specialty by am best below b or by s p below a would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility with barclays bank plc 
any such downgrade could reduce our liquidity and financial flexibility 
we may be unable to enter into sufficient reinsurance security arrangements and the cost of these arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as non us reinsurers  aspen bermuda and aspen re are required to post collateral security with respect to liabilities they assume from ceding insurers domiciled in the united states 
the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit in their us statutory financial statements with respect to liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trust assets are held by the ceding company 
aspen re is required to post letters of credit or establish other security for its us cedents in an amount equal to of reinsurance recoverables under the agreements to which it is a party with the us cedents 
we have currently in place letters of credit facilities and trust funds  as further described in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  to satisfy these requirements 
if these facilities are not sufficient or if the company is unable to renew these facilities or is unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of aspen bermuda and aspen re to provide reinsurance to us based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties and  consequently  reduce the liquidity of our assets 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda or uk law 
these restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could adversely affect our profitability 
as at december   we have approximately billion in such trust funds 
continuing investigations of broker market practices and the potential impact of the recent marsh settlement could adversely affect our business 
investigations of broker placement and compensation practices initiated by the attorneys general and insurance regulators of certain states beginning with new york in october  together with associated class action lawsuits initiated against such broker entities  have challenged the legality of certain broker activities 
marsh and the new york attorney general entered into a settlement agreement on january  apart from marsh  various brokers with whom we do business are included within these investigations and lawsuits 
the investigations and suits challenge  among other things  the appropriateness of setting fees paid to brokers based on the volume of business placed by a broker with a particular insurer or reinsurer  the payment of contingent fees to brokers by insurers or reinsurers because of alleged conflicts of interest arising from such fee arrangements  the nondisclosure by brokers to their clients of contingent fees paid to them by insurers and reinsurers  and bid rigging and the tying of receipt of direct insurance to placing reinsurance through the same broker 
the marsh new york attorney general settlement confirms that marsh units that deal with us clients  at least  must implement a series of business reforms relating to insurer compensation  disclosures to clients  use of wholesalers and employee training  among other things  and must submit to greater regulatory oversight by the new york insurance department 
because many investigations and suits continue and others may yet be filed  it is not possible to determine their ultimate impact upon brokers  insurers and reinsurers  including our various business units that handle us insurance and reinsurance risks 
however  because of aspen re s and aspen specialty s reliance on brokers for future business  any governmental actions or judicial decisions which have the effect of impairing these broker markets could materially impact our ability to underwrite business 
in addition  to the extent that any of the industry wide arrangements with our brokers were determined to be improper  we could be fined or otherwise penalized 
aspen re  our uk subsidiary  is regulated by the fsa 
the fsa has commenced a review of the arrangements that insurers and brokers have in place to manage their conflicts of interest 
in the event that the fsa perceives that brokers and insurers are not disclosing commissions when specifically asked  or if they offer or receive inducements contrary to the interests of the insured  the fsa may exercise its regulatory powers over brokers  insurers and reinsurers 
should brokers with which we deal seek to increase commission levels in order to make up revenue shortfalls  we could be adversely impacted 
to the extent that state regulation of brokers and intermediaries becomes more onerous  costs of regulatory compliance for aspen management and aspen re america will increase 
finally  to the extent that any of the brokers with whom we do business suffer financial difficulties as a result of the investigations or proceedings  we could suffer increased credit risk 
see our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
and since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
below 
recent investigations of certain reinsurance accounting practices could adversely affect our business 
certain reinsurance contracts are highly customized and typically involve complicated structural elements 
us gaap governs whether or not a contract should be accounted for as reinsurance 
contracts that do not meet these us gaap requirements may not be accounted for as reinsurance and are required to be accounted for as deposits 
these contracts also require judgments regarding the timing of accruals under us gaap 
as reported in the press  certain insurance and reinsurance arrangements involving other companies  and the accounting judgments that they have made  are coming under scrutiny by the new york attorney general s office  the sec and other governmental authorities 
at this time  we are unable to predict the ultimate effects  if any  that these industry investigations and related settlements may have upon the accounting for reinsurance and related industry practices or what  if any  changes may be made to practices involving financial reporting 
changes to any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
however  due to the unsettled and fact specific nature of the law  we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses related to such credit risks 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
see item  business business distribution for our principal brokers by segment 
several of these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that compete with us  and these brokers may favor their own insurers or reinsurers over other companies 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party service providers for some claims handling 
we rely on third party service providers to assist in handling some claims activity 
if our third party service providers fail to perform as expected  it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
if we fail to develop the necessary infrastructure as we grow  our future financial results may be adversely affected 
our recent expansion in the united kingdom  united states and bermuda has placed and will continue to place increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
to the extent we are unable to attract additional professionals  our financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives  potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible 
furthermore  although we terminated our agreement with wellington for information technology systems  we have entered into an interim agreement with wellington to use their underwriting support software  pending our implementation of a new system 
we are in the process of developing or implementing new information technology systems  including underwriting and financial support systems 
to the extent we are not able to develop and implement new systems that meet our business needs  we may be required to continue with our existing arrangements or accept a less sophisticated system 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage such transition or expansion 
our inability to achieve such development or effective management may impair our future financial results 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we may pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
we have limited experience in identifying quality merger candidates  as well as successfully acquiring and integrating their operations 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
our funds are invested by several professional investment management firms under the direction of our investment committee in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us 
see business investments under item  above 
although our investment policies stress diversification of risks  conservation of principal and liquidity  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the occurrence of large claims may force us to liquidate securities at an inopportune time  which may cause us to incur capital losses 
if we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance and reinsurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss in order to cover such liabilities 
large investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base  thereby affecting our ability to underwrite new business 
for the twelve months ended december    or million  of our total revenue was derived from our net invested assets 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our operating results are affected  in part  by the performance of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains interest sensitive instruments  such as bonds  which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations 
for example  if interest rates decline  funds reinvested will earn less than expected 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our mitigation efforts include maintaining a portfolio  diversified by obligor and emphasizing higher rated securities  with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite our mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write liability casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia  where claims inflation has grown particularly strong in recent years 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our segments are the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   and   and respectively of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us non british currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may use currency hedges to manage probable significant losses that will be paid in non us non british currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully structure those hedges so as to effectively manage these risks 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations in territories where we currently engage in business or obtain them in new territories  or may be able to do so only at significant cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or to engage in certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see business regulatory matters in item  above 
aspen re 
aspen re has authorization from the fsa to write certain classes of insurance business in the united kingdom 
as an fsa authorized insurer  the insurance and reinsurance businesses of aspen re will be subject to close supervision by the fsa 
changes in the fsa s requirements from time may have an adverse impact on the business of aspen re 
if any entity were to hold or more of the voting rights or or more of the issued ordinary shares of aspen holdings  transactions between aspen re and such entity may have to be reported to the fsa if the value of those transactions exceeds certain threshold amounts that would render them material connected party transactions 
in these circumstances  we cannot assure you that these material connected party transactions will not be subject to regulatory intervention by the fsa 
see part iii  item  certain relationships and related transactions 
aspen re is required to provide the fsa with information about aspen holdings notional solvency  which involves calculating the solvency position of aspen holdings in accordance with the fsa s rules 
in this regard  if aspen bermuda or aspen specialty were to experience financial difficulties  it could affect the solvency position of aspen holdings and in turn trigger regulatory intervention by the fsa with respect to aspen re 
furthermore  any transactions between aspen re  aspen specialty and aspen bermuda that are material connected party transactions would also have to be reported to the fsa 
we cannot assure you that the existence or effect of such connected party transactions and the fsa s assessment of the overall solvency of aspen holdings and its subsidiaries  even in circumstances where aspen re has on its face sufficient assets of its own to cover its required margin of solvency  would not result in regulatory intervention by the fsa with regard to aspen re 
in addition  given that the framework for supervision of insurance and reinsurance companies in the united kingdom must comply with eu directives which are implemented by member states through national legislation  changes at the eu level may affect the regulatory scheme under which aspen re will operate 
a general review of eu insurance directives  known as solvency ii  is currently in progress and may lead to changes such as increased or risk based minimum capital requirements though these are not expected to be introduced in the near future 
on december  the eu reinsurance directive came into force 
member states have until december  to implement the directive into domestic law 
reinsurance business is already subject to regulation in the uk and the implementation of the reinsurance directive is unlikely to materially adversely affect aspen re 
however  we can give no assurance that this will be the case 
the fsa requires insurers and reinsurers to calculate their ecr which includes capital charges based on assets  claims and premiums 
the level of ecr seems likely to be at least twice the existing required minimum solvency margin for most companies  although the fsa had already adopted an informal approach of encouraging companies to hold at least twice the current eu minimum 
in addition  the fsa may give guidance regularly to insurers under individual capital guidance  which may result in guidance that a company should hold in excess of the ecr 
these changes may increase the required regulatory capital of aspen re 
aspen re does not presently intend that it will be admitted to do business in any jurisdiction other than the united kingdom  canada  ireland and the other member states of the european economic area 
we cannot assure you  however  that insurance regulators in the united states  bermuda or elsewhere will not review the activities of aspen re and claim that aspen re is subject to such jurisdiction s licensing or other requirements 
aspen bermuda 
aspen bermuda is a registered class bermuda insurance and reinsurance company 
among other matters  bermuda statutes  regulations and policies of the bma require aspen bermuda to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  to meet solvency standards  to obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares and to submit to certain periodic examinations of its financial condition 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict aspen bermuda s ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
aspen bermuda does not maintain a principal office  and its personnel do not solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other activities that may constitute the transaction of the business of insurance or reinsurance  in any jurisdiction in which it is not licensed or otherwise not authorized to engage in such activities 
although aspen bermuda does not believe it is or will be in violation of insurance laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to aspen bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities may still be raised in the future 
the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the united states and various states within the united states 
compliance with any new laws  regulations or settlements impacting offshore insurers or reinsurers  such as aspen bermuda  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aspen specialty 
aspen specialty is organized in and has received a license to write certain lines of insurance business in the state of north dakota and  as a result  is subject to north dakota law and regulation under the supervision of the commissioner of insurance of the state of north dakota 
the north dakota commissioner of insurance also has regulatory authority over a number of affiliate transactions between aspen specialty and other members of our holding company system 
the purpose of the state insurance regulatory statutes is to protect us insureds and us ceding insurance companies  not our shareholders or noteholders 
among other matters  state insurance regulations will require aspen specialty to maintain minimum levels of capital  surplus and liquidity  require aspen specialty to comply with applicable risk based capital requirements and will impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of aspen specialty to write new business or distribute assets to aspen holdings 
in recent years  the us insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
in addition  some members of congress have begun to explore whether the federal government should play a greater role in the regulation of insurance 
moreover  the national association of insurance commissioners  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia  and state insurance regulators regularly examine existing laws and regulations 
changes in federal or state laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the world trade center tragedy  tria was enacted to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the united states 
this law was extended by triea and establishes a federal assistance program through the end of to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and regulates the terms of insurance relating to terrorism coverage 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
for example  a bill now pending in the us congress would limit the liability of certain defendants who have asbestos liabilities  but would also require defendants and insurers to contribute to a trust fund to compensate persons alleging to have been harmed by asbestos exposure 
to the extent that the passage of such legislation might provide our competitors with somewhat greater certainty as to their ultimate asbestos liabilities  some of their current reserves might be released  thus providing them additional underwriting capacity 
this  in turn  could result in increased competitive pressure on us 
however  because prospects for passage of this bill as well as its details the trust fund provisions in particular are uncertain  we cannot at this time predict how the passage of such legislation might impact us 
our ability to pay dividends or to meet ongoing cash requirements may be constrained by our holding company structure 
we are a holding company and  as such  have no substantial operations of our own 
we do not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of our insurance subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries are expected to be our sole source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including our debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to our shareholders 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see business regulatory matters bermuda regulation minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions  business regulatory matters uk and uk regulation restrictions on dividend payments  and business regulatory matters us regulation north dakota state dividend limitations in item above 
certain regulatory and other constraints may limit our ability to pay dividends 
we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make other payments 
under the companies act  we may declare or pay a dividend out of distributable reserves only if we have reasonable grounds to believe that we are  and would after the payment be  able to pay our liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of our assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
if you require dividend income you should carefully consider these risks before investing in us 
for more information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and our insurance subsidiaries  see business regulatory matters in item above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item several of our founding shareholders and some of our directors may have conflicts of interest with us 
several of our founding shareholders and some of our directors engage in commercial activities and enter into transactions or agreements with us or in competition with us  which may give rise to conflicts of interest 
of our directors  julian avery was the chief executive officer of wellington until his resignation effective september  we had in place certain quota share agreements under our framework agreement and an administrative services agreement with wellington and its affiliates for which we received notice of termination in december  with termination effective months from the date of notice 
we also entered into an it services agreement with wellington which was terminated effective august and an interim agreement to use their underwriting support software  pending our implementation of a new system 
see part iii  item  certain relationships and related transactions transactions and relationships with initial investors 
in addition  several of our founding shareholders and some of our directors have sponsored or invested in  and may in the future sponsor or invest in  other entities engaged in or intending to engage in insurance and reinsurance underwriting  some of which may compete with us 
they have also entered into  or may in the future enter into  agreements with companies that may compete with us 
we do not have any agreement or understanding with any of these parties regarding the resolution of potential conflicts of interest 
in addition  we may not be in a position to influence any party s decision to engage in activities that would give rise to a conflict of interest 
these parties may take actions that are not in our shareholders best interests 
see business reinsurance in item above and certain relationships and related transactions in part iii  item moreover  under bermuda law and our bye laws  any transaction entered into by us in which a director has an interest is not voidable by us nor can such director be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction  provided that the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors 
in addition  our bye laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he has an interest unless the majority of the disinterested directors determines otherwise 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
to the extent that our funds are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and or cover claim losses  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
our additional needs for capital will depend on our actual claims experience  especially any catastrophic events 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
risks related to our industry we operate in a highly competitive environment  and substantial new capital inflows into the insurance and reinsurance industry may increase competition 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
see business competition in item above for a list of our competitors 
we compete primarily on the basis of experience  the strength of our client relationships  reputation  premiums charged  policy and contract terms and conditions  products offered  speed of claims payment  overall financial strength  ratings and scope of business both by size and geographic location 
a number of bermuda based insurance and reinsurance entities compete in the same market segments in which we operate and have also recently raised additional capital to support their operations 
many of these entities derive their profits primarily through bermuda operations and  consequently  may achieve a lower overall global effective tax rate than us 
in addition  as a result of the anticipated increases in premium rates in selected lines of business due to the hurricanes  a number of new bermuda based start up entities have raised capital and compete in lines of business similar to our lines of business 
we may not be aware of additional companies that may be planning to enter the lines of business of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
we have recently experienced increased competition in some lines of business which has caused a decline in rate increases or a reduction in rates 
further  insurance risk linked securities and derivatives and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  including non insurance company entities  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance and reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could also increase competition in our industries 
new competition could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
recent events may result in political  regulatory and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance coverage has decreased due to withdrawal of capacity and substantial reductions in capital resulting from  among other things  the terrorist attacks of september  and the and hurricanes in the united states 
this tightening of supply has resulted in governmental intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets  both in the united states and worldwide 
government sponsored initiatives in other countries to address the risk of losses from terrorist attacks are similarly subject to change which may impact our business 
for example  on november   tria was enacted and extended by triea on december  until december  to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the united states 
this law requires insurers writing certain lines of property and casualty insurance to offer coverage against certain acts of terrorism causing damage within the united states or to us flagged vessels or aircraft 
in return  the law requires the federal government to indemnify such insurers for of insured losses resulting from covered acts of terrorism  subject to a premium based deductible 
in addition  certain states have recently adopted rules and orders restricting the ability of an insurer to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations and orders that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict aspen specialty s ability to exit unprofitable markets or adjust its participation levels 
we are currently unable to predict the extent to which the lapse or replacement of triea  or other new terrorism risk initiatives  or how states affected by the and hurricanes respond with regulatory restrictions on surplus lines insurers  may affect the demand for  pricing of  or the supply of our products or the risks that our customers may expect us  and our competitors  to underwrite 
any significant regulatory restrictions in the markets in which we operate may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates 
historically  insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and other factors 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
as a result  the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance may increase  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing or new insurers or reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
although premium levels for many products have increased in the recent past  there are several lines of business in which rates are stabilizing or declining which may indicate a change in the cycle 
however  in light of the hurricanes  rates in certain lines may once again increase 
in respect of current market conditions  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market conditions  rate trends and developments in any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly  and we expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted  and the frequency and severity of such loss activity has recently increased 
although the industry and we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our exposure to catastrophe pricing  accumulation and estimated losses which assume various conditions and probability scenarios  such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
the and hurricane seasons showed a marked increase in windstorm activity  and this trend may continue in future seasons 
both the total number of storms and their intensity were greater than recent years  as were corresponding claims and loss activity  as evidenced by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
we must assess the likelihood that this increased windstorm activity will continue 
in any event  the customary industry accepted methods of underwriting  reserving or investing may not be adequate and we may need to develop new means of managing risks related to catastrophes 
for example  industry catastrophe pricing  accumulation and estimated loss models use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
these models have been evolving since the early s 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
these limitations are evidenced by significant variation in estimates between models and modelers  material increases and decreases in model results over time due to changes in the models and refinement of the underlying data elements and assumptions  questionable predictive capability over time intervals  and post event measurement that have provided ranges of estimates that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of policy language  mold losses  demand surges  accumulations of losses under similar policies and loss adjustment expenses  each of which are subject to wide variation by storm 
we may not be able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes due to environmental factors  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
to assess our loss exposure  we rely on natural catastrophe models that are built partly on science  partly on historical data and partly on professional judgment of our employees and other industry specialists 
although the accuracy of the models significantly improved in the last few years  they still yield significant variations in loss estimates due to the quality of underlying data and assumptions 
interpretation of modeling results remains subjective  and none of the existing models reflects our policy language  demand surges and other storm specific factors such as where the storms will actually travel 
there is little consensus in the scientific community regarding the effect of global environmental factors on catastrophes 
climatologists concur that heat from the ocean drives hurricanes  but they cannot agree how much it changes the annual outlook 
in addition  scientists have recently recorded rising sea temperatures which may result in higher frequency and severity of windstorms 
it is unclear whether rising sea temperatures are part of a longer cycle and if they are caused or aggravated by man made pollution or other factors 
given the scientific uncertainty about the causes of increased frequency and severity of catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools  we may not be able to adequately model the associated losses  which would adversely affect our profitability 
risks related to our ordinary shares future sales of ordinary shares may affect their market price and the future exercise of options may result in immediate and substantial dilution 
as of december   there were  ordinary shares outstanding 
of these shares  a substantial majority are freely transferable  except for any shares sold to our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act 
on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form f with the sec which included  ordinary shares that may be offered for sale by our shareholders 
we have entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement  dated november   with blackstone  wellington  candover  mourant co 
trustees limited  csfb private equity  montpelier re  the names trustee as defined below  i  phoenix  olympus and the lexicon partnership llp lexicon  pursuant to which we may be required to register our ordinary shares held by such parties under the securities act 
at any time any such shareholder party or group of shareholders other than directors  officers or employees of the company that holds in the aggregate at least million of our shares has the right to request registration for a public offering of all or a portion of its shares  subject to the limitations and restrictions provided in the agreement 
we may effect any such future registration request under the form f  in which case the related public offering may occur on short notice 
any announcement relating to a registration  offering or sale of our ordinary shares  under the form f or otherwise  could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares 
with respect to any outstanding ordinary shares that have not been registered  they may not be sold in the absence of registration under the securities act unless an exemption from registration is available  including the exemptions contained in rule under rule k  a person who is not our affiliate  and who has not been our affiliate at any time during the days preceding any sale  is entitled to sell the shares without regard to the foregoing limitations  provided that at least two years have elapsed since the shares were acquired from us or any affiliate of ours 
a large percentage of our initial investors have held a portion of our ordinary shares for at least two years  although some of those investors may be deemed our affiliates 
moreover  as of february   an additional  ordinary shares were issuable upon the full exercise on a cash basis of outstanding options by wellington the wellington options and harrington trust limited  which name was changed to appleby bermuda trust limited effective october  the names trustee  as successor trustee of the names trust  which holds the options collectively with the wellington options  the investor options and shares for the benefit of the members of syndicate who are not corporate members of wellington 
wellington and the names trustee may exercise their options on a cashless basis  which allows them to realize the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the options and the then prevailing market price without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares in cash 
thus  the option holder receives fewer shares upon exercise 
ordinary shares issued upon the exercise of options on a cashless basis will be issued as a bonus issue of shares in accordance with section a of the companies act 
this section provides that the share premium account of a company may be applied in paying up shares issued to shareholders as fully paid shares 
this cashless exercise feature may provide an incentive for wellington and the names trustee to exercise their options more quickly 
in the event that the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares are exercised  you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of your investment 
in addition  we have filed a registration statement on form s under the securities act to register ordinary shares issued or reserved for issuance under our share incentive plan 
subject to the exercise of issued and outstanding options and shareholder agreements between the company and individual employees  shares registered under the registration statement on form s may be available for sale into the public markets 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future sales of our ordinary shares  or the availability of ordinary shares for future sale  will have on the market price of our ordinary shares 
sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares 
see shareholders agreement and registration rights agreement in part ii  item f for further information regarding circumstances under which ordinary shares may be sold 
furthermore  on december   we issued  perpetual income equity replacement security the perpetual piers 
each perpetual piers will be convertible  at the option of the holder thereof  into one perpetual preference share and a number of our ordinary shares  if any  based on an initial conversion rate of ordinary shares per liquidation preference of perpetual piers  subject to specified adjustments 
in addition  at any time on or after january   under certain circumstances  we may  at our option  cause each perpetual piers to be automatically converted into in cash and ordinary shares  if any 
the conversion of some or all of our perpetual piers will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders 
any sales in the public market of our ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ordinary shares 
in addition  the existence of our perpetual piers may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our perpetual piers could depress the price of our ordinary shares 
there are provisions in our charter documents which may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
in general  and except as provided below  shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  if  and so long as  the ordinary shares of a shareholder are treated as controlled shares as determined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code of any us person as defined below and such controlled shares constitute or more of the votes conferred by our issued shares  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such us person a us shareholder shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than  under a formula specified in our bye laws 
the formula is applied repeatedly until the voting power of all us shareholders has been reduced to less than 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s voting rights including appointment rights  if any  granted to holders of our perpetual piers or to holders of our perpetual preference shares where it deems it appropriate to do so to i avoid the existence of any us shareholder  and ii avoid certain material adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or any holder of our shares or its affiliates 
controlled shares includes  among other things  all shares of the company that such us person is deemed to own directly  indirectly or constructively within the meaning of section of the code 
as of december   there were  ordinary shares outstanding  of which  ordinary shares would constitute of the votes conferred by our issued and outstanding shares 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation  or entity treated as a corporation  created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes or v any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
see bye laws in part ii  item g 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
our bye laws provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by them 
as a result of any reallocation of votes  voting rights of some of our shareholders might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in such shareholders becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of the votes of our shareholders could result in some of the shareholders becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act in the event that the company no longer qualifies as a foreign private issuer 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated under the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate such shareholder s voting rights 
there are provisions in our bye laws which may restrict the ability to transfer ordinary shares and which may require shareholders to sell their ordinary shares 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if it appears to the board of directors  in their sole and reasonable discretion  after taking into account the limitations on voting rights contained in our bye laws  that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders or their affiliates may occur as a result of such transfer 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in material adverse tax consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any shareholder or its affiliates  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair market value the minimum number of ordinary shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the material adverse tax consequences 
laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we conduct business could delay or deter a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be desirable and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and have the effect of entrenching management  and your ability to purchase more than of our voting shares will be restricted 
ordinary shares may be offered or sold in bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the investment business act of bermuda which regulates the sale of securities in bermuda 
in addition  the bma must approve all issuances and transfers of shares of a bermuda exempted company other than in cases where the bma has granted a general permission 
the bma in its policy dated june  provides that where any equity securities of a bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange  general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of the securities of the company from and or to a non resident  for as long as any equities securities of the company remain so listed 
notwithstanding the above general permission  we have obtained from the bma their permission for the issue and free transferability of the ordinary shares in the company  as long as the shares are listed on the nyse or other appointed stock exchange  to and among persons who are non residents of bermuda for exchange control purposes and of up to of the ordinary shares to and among persons who are residents in bermuda for exchange control purposes 
the bma and the registrar of companies accept no responsibility for the financial soundness of any proposal or for the correctness of any of the statements made or opinions expressed in this report 
the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares of a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of fsma  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of aspen re 
under fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must notify the fsa of his intention to do so and obtain the fsa s prior approval 
the fsa would then have three months to consider that person s application to acquire control 
in considering whether to approve such application  the fsa must be satisfied both that the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application would constitute a criminal offense 
under the north dakota insurance holding company statutes  if a holder would acquire beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding voting securities without the prior approval of the north dakota insurance commissioner  then our north dakota insurance subsidiary or the north dakota insurance commission is entitled to injunctive relief  including enjoining any proposed acquisition  or seizing ordinary shares owned by such person  and such ordinary shares would not be entitled to be voted 
there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned greater than of our ordinary shares did not  because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares  control the applicable insurance subsidiary 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 
if these restrictions delay  deter or prevent a change of control  such restrictions may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance 
we cannot pay a dividend on our ordinary shares unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid 
our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares that are issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers at the option of the holders thereof will rank senior to our ordinary shares with respect to the payment of dividends 
as a result  unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid or declared and a sum or  if we so elect  ordinary shares sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside  we cannot declare or pay a dividend or declare and set aside a sum or  if we so elect  ordinary shares sufficient for the payment thereof on our ordinary shares 
under the terms of perpetual piers  these restrictions will continue until full dividends on all outstanding perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares for four consecutive dividend periods have been declared and paid or declared and a sum or  if we so elect  ordinary shares sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment 
our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares in the event of a liquidation  winding up or dissolution of the company 
in the event of a liquidation  winding up or dissolution of the company  our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement 
in such an event  there may not be sufficient assets remaining  after payments to holders of our perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares  to ensure payments to holders of ordinary shares 
a few large shareholders may be able to influence significant corporate actions 
as of february  we had five shareholder groups who owned approximately  ordinary shares including the wellington options representing approximately of the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares assuming full exercise on a cash basis of wellington options 
as a result of their ownership position  these shareholders voting together may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval  including  without limitation  the election of directors and amalgamations  consolidations  changes of control of our company and sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
if these shareholders were to act together  they would be able to exercise control over most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by the other shareholders 
us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to us  differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the companies act which includes  where relevant  information on modifications thereto adopted under our bye laws  applicable to us  which differ in certain respects from provisions of delaware corporate law which is representative of the corporate law of the various states comprising the united states 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not discuss all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders 
interested directors 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  a transaction entered into by us  in which a director has an interest  will not be voidable by us  and such director will not be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction  provided the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors  or in writing  to the directors 
in addition  our bye laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which that director has an interest following a declaration of the interest under the companies act  unless the majority of the disinterested directors determine otherwise 
under delaware law  the transaction would not be voidable if

the transaction was fair as to the corporation at the time it was authorized  approved or ratified 
business combinations with large shareholders or affiliates 
as a bermuda company  we may enter into business combinations with our large shareholders or one or more wholly owned subsidiaries  including asset sales and other transactions in which a large shareholder or a wholly owned subsidiary receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders or other wholly owned subsidiaries  without obtaining prior approval from our shareholders and without special approval from our board of directors 
under bermuda law  amalgamations require the approval of the board of directors  and except in the case of amalgamations with and between wholly owned subsidiaries  shareholder approval 
however  when the affairs of a bermuda company are being conducted in a manner which is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders  one or more shareholders may apply to a bermuda court  which may make an order as it sees fit  including an order regulating the conduct of the company s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or the company 
if we were a delaware company  we would need prior approval from our board of directors or a supermajority of our shareholders to enter into a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder  unless we opted out of the relevant delaware statute 
bermuda law or our bye laws would require board approval and  in some instances  shareholder approval of such transactions 
shareholders suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to commence a derivative action in our name to remedy a wrong done to us where an act is alleged to be beyond our corporate power  is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
our bye laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director s or officer s duties  except with respect to any fraud of the director or officer or to recover any gain  personal profit or advantage to which the director or officer is not legally entitled 
class actions and derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under delaware law for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in such actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
indemnification of directors and officers 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  we may indemnify our directors  officers  any other person appointed to a committee of the board of directors or resident representative and their respective heirs  executors or administrators to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense  incurred or suffered by such persons by reason of any act done  conceived in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of their duties  provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter which would render such indemnification void under the companies act 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against expenses including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in defense of an action  suit or proceeding by reason of such position if i such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and ii with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors  which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares 
our bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
for example  our bye laws contain the following provisions that could have such an effect

we are a bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  certain of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as such  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we have been advised by bermuda counsel that there is no treaty in force between the us and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a us judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a us court that is final and for a sum certain based on us federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the us court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda not us law 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a us federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
it is the advice of our bermuda counsel that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
risks related to taxation we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given each of aspen holdings and aspen bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to aspen holdings  aspen bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  our non us companies may be subject to non us tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment 
if aspen holdings or any of its foreign subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business  in which case its results of operations could be materially adversely affected although its results of operations should not be materially adversely affected if aspen re is considered to be engaged in a us trade or business solely as a result of the binding authorities granted to aspen re america  aspen management and wu inc aspen holdings and aspen bermuda are bermuda companies  and aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services are uk companies 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies will operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on certain us source investment income and the likely imposition of us corporate income and additional branch profits tax on the profits attributable to the business of aspen re produced pursuant to the binding authorities granted to aspen re america and aspen management  as well as the binding authorities previously granted to wu inc because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states other than aspen re with respect to the business produced pursuant to the aspen re america  aspen management and prior wu inc binding authorities agreements 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that some or all of aspen holdings or its foreign subsidiaries is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states based on activities in addition to the binding authorities discussed above 
our non uk companies may be subject to non uk tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
none of us  except for aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  is incorporated in the united kingdom 
accordingly  none of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  should be treated as being resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes unless our central management and control is exercised in the united kingdom 
the concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company  which is wholly a question of fact 
each of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  intends to manage our affairs so that none of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  is resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes 
a company not resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes can nevertheless be subject to uk corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom but the charge to uk corporation tax is limited to profits including revenue profits and capital gains attributable directly or indirectly to such permanent establishment 
each of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services which should be treated as resident in the united kingdom by virtue of being incorporated and managed there  intends that we will operate in such a manner so that none of us  other than aspen re and aspen uk services  carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statute definitively defines the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  her majesty s revenue and customs might contend successfully that any of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  are is trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
the united kingdom has no income tax treaty with bermuda 
there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the united kingdom nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a permanent establishment but each of us intend that we will operate in such a manner that none of us will fall within the charge to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding in this respect 
if any of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen re and aspen uk services  were treated as being resident in the united kingdom for uk corporation tax purposes  or if any of us were to be treated as carrying on a trade in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
holders of or more of aspen holdings shares may be subject to us income taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
if you are a us shareholder of a foreign corporation defined as a us person as defined below who owns directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively as defined below at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation  that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and you own shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the cfc s taxable year  you must include in your gross income for us federal income tax purposes your pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a foreign insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income such as interest dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment income 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of that foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of that foreign corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a foreign insurance company in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation  or entity treated as a corporation  created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes or v any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
we believe that because of the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership  provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power these provisions are described under bye laws in item g below and other factors  no us person who owns shares of aspen holdings directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through foreign entities  or constructively or more of the total voting power of all classes of shares of aspen holdings or any of its foreign subsidiaries 
it is possible  however  that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
us persons who hold our shares may be subject to us income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our related party insurance income rpii 
if the rpii determined on a gross basis of any of our foreign insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed of that company s gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to those insureds own directly or indirectly through entities or more of the voting power or value of aspen holdings  then a us person who owns any shares of such foreign insurance subsidiary directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes such person s pro rata share of such company s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to us persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
the amount of rpii earned by a foreign insurance subsidiary generally  premium and related investment income from the indirect or direct insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect us holder of shares or any person related to such holder will depend on a number of factors  including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by the company 
we believe that the direct or indirect insureds of each of our foreign insurance subsidiaries and related persons did not directly or indirectly own or more of either the voting power or value of our shares in prior years of operation and we do not expect this to be the case in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we do not expect gross rpii of each of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to equal or exceed of its gross insurance income in any taxable year for the foreseeable future  but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of rpii may be beyond our control 
us persons who dispose of our shares may be subject to us federal income taxation at the rates applicable to dividends on a portion of such disposition 
the rpii rules provide that if a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation in which us persons own or more of the shares even if the amount of gross rpii is less than of the corporation s gross insurance income and the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the threshold  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a holder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the holder 
these rpii rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because aspen holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have never been interpreted by the courts or the treasury department in final regulations  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts  or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
the treasury department has authority to impose  among other things  additional reporting requirements with respect to rpii 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and the application thereof to us is uncertain 
us persons who hold our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
if we are considered a pfic for us federal income tax purposes  a us person who owns any shares of the company will be subject to adverse tax consequences including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we were considered a pfic  upon the death of any us individual owning shares  such individual s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a step up in the basis of the shares that might otherwise be available under us federal income tax laws 
we believe that we are not  have not been  and currently do not expect to become  a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be deemed a pfic by the irs 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 
us tax exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income 
a us tax exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of the insurance income of either of our foreign insurance subsidiaries is allocated to the organization  which generally would be the case if either of our foreign insurance subsidiaries is a cfc and the tax exempt shareholder is a us shareholder or there is rpii  certain exceptions do not apply and the tax exempt organization owns any shares of the company 
although we do not believe that any us persons should be allocated such insurance income  we cannot be certain that this will be the case 
us tax exempt investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors 
changes in us federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our shares 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
while there are no currently pending legislative proposals which  if enacted  would have a material adverse effect on us or our shareholders  it is possible that broader based legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us  or our shareholders 
additionally  the us federal income tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a trade or business within the united states  or is a pfic  or whether us persons would be required to include in their gross income the subpart f income or the rpii of a cfc are subject to change  possibly on a retroactive basis 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic rules to insurance companies and the regulations regarding rpii are still in proposed form 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot be certain if  when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd  has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june  bermuda was not listed as a tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously signed a letter committing itself to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes

the landlord s works were completed in november the basic annual rent for each of the leases will each be subject to yearly upwards only rent reviews 
there are no contractual provisions in any of the leases allowing us to terminate any of the leases prior to expiration of the year contractual terms

we believe that our office space is sufficient for us to conduct our operations for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry  we are subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business 
while any proceeding contains an element of uncertainty  we do not believe that the eventual outcome of any litigation or arbitration proceeding to which we are presently a party will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business 
our subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the investigation and the defense of claims arising out of their business 
pursuant to our insurance and reinsurance arrangements  disputes are generally required to be finally settled by arbitration

c any determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations and cash flows  our financial position and capital requirements  general business conditions  legal  tax  regulatory and any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant at the time 
see table above for dividends paid 
we are a holding company and have no direct operations 
our ability to pay dividends depends  in part  on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay us dividends 
the insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends

our board and corporate action 
our bye laws provide that the board shall consist of not less than six and not more than directors 
subject to our bye laws and bermuda law  the directors shall be elected or appointed by holders of ordinary shares 
our board of directors is divided into three classes  designated class i  class ii and class iii and is elected by the shareholders as follows 
each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual general meeting of shareholders next following the annual general meeting at which such director was elected  provided that i directors initially designated as class i directors shall serve for an initial term ending on the date of the third annual general meeting of shareholders following june   ii directors initially designated as class ii directors shall serve for an initial term ending on the fourth annual general meeting following june   and iii directors initially designated as class iii directors shall serve for an initial term ending on the fifth annual general meeting following june  notwithstanding the foregoing  each director shall hold office until such director s successor shall have been duly elected or until such director is removed from office or such office is otherwise vacated 
in the event of any change in the number of directors  the board of directors shall apportion any newly created directorships among  or reduce the number of directorships in  such class or classes as shall equalize  as nearly as possible  the number of directors in each class 
in no event will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director 
generally  the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be required to authorize corporate action

h investor options upon our formation in june  we issued to wellington options to purchase  non voting shares the wellington options and issued to the names trustee  as trustee of names trust for the benefit of the unaligned members  options to purchase  non voting shares the names options  and together with the wellington options  the investor options 
all non voting shares issued or to be issued upon the exercise of the investor options will automatically convert into ordinary shares at a one to one ratio upon issuance 
on december   wellington transferred the wellington options to its wholly owned subsidiary wellington investment 
as of february   the names trustee held  names options 
the rights of the holders of the investor options are governed by an option instrument dated june   which was amended and restated on december  and further amended and restated on september   to effect certain of the provisions described below the option instrument 
the term of the investor options expires on june  the investor options may be exercised in whole or in part 
under the option instrument  the wellington options are exercisable at any time subject to a minimum number of options to be exercised 
the names options are exercisable without regard to a minimum number of options to be exercised  at a sale as defined in the option instrument and on a monthly basis beginning in october expiring june  unless earlier lapsed following notification by the unaligned members to the names trustee of their elections to exercise the names options 
the investor options will lapse on the earlier occurrence of i the end of the term of the investor options  ii the liquidation of the company other than a liquidation in connection with a reconstruction or amalgamation or iii the completion of a sale if such options are not exercised in connection with such sale 
if wellington materially breaches its obligations under the framework agreement and the shareholder s agreement between the company and wellington dated november  with respect to its non compete undertakings and its prohibition on soliciting employees of the company  then the wellington options will immediately lapse for those options that have not been exercised or that have been exercised but for which ordinary shares have not yet been issued 
the exercise price payable for each option share is  together with interest accruing at per annum less any dividends or other distributions from the date of issue of the investor options june  until the date of exercise of the investor options 
each optionholder may exercise its options on a cashless basis  subject to relevant requirements of the companies act 
a cashless exercise allows the optionholders to realize  through the receipt of ordinary shares  the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the investor options and the then prevailing market prices without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares 
as a result  the optionholder receives fewer shares upon exercise 
for any exercise of the investor options on a cashless basis  the number of ordinary shares to be issued would be based on the difference between the exercise price on the date of exercise and the then prevailing market price of the ordinary shares  calculated using the average closing price for five preceding trading days 
following the issuance of the investor options  there are a range of anti dilution protections for the optionholders if any issuance or reclassification of our shares or similar matters are effected below fair market value  subject to certain exceptions 
under these circumstances  an adjustment to the subscription rights of the optionholders or the subscription price of the investor options shall be made by our board of directors 
if optionholders holding or more of the rights to subscribe for non voting shares under the investor options so request  any adjustment proposed by our board of directors may be referred to independent financial advisors for their determination 
i description of our perpetual piers in december  our board of directors authorized the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of  of our perpetual piers  with a liquidation preference of per security

dividends on our perpetual piers are payable on a non cumulative basis only when  as and if declared by our board of directors at the annual rate of of the liquidation preference of each perpetual piers  payable quarterly in cash  or if we elect  ordinary shares or a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
generally  unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid  we cannot declare or pay a dividend on our ordinary shares 
each perpetual piers is convertible  at the holder s option at any time  initially based on a conversion rate of ordinary shares per liquidation preference of perpetual piers equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per ordinary share  subject to certain adjustments 
whenever dividends on any perpetual piers have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of any six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive a nonpayment  subject to certain conditions  the holders of our perpetual piers will be entitled to the appointment of two directors  and the number of directors that comprise our board will be increased by the number of directors so appointed 
these appointing rights and the terms of the directors so appointed will continue until dividends on our perpetual piers and any such series of voting preference shares following the nonpayment shall have been fully paid for at least four consecutive dividend periods 
in addition  the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least of the aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding perpetual piers and any series of appointing preference shares  acting together as a single class  will be required for the authorization or issuance of any class or series of share capital or security convertible into or exchangeable for shares ranking senior to our perpetual piers as to dividend rights or rights upon our liquidation  winding up or dissolution and for amendments to our memorandum of association or bye laws that would materially adversely affect the rights of holders of perpetual piers
