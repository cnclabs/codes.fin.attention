chief executive officer s summary financial results the company s net sales totaled million  a percent increase compared to the increase was the result of changes in currency exchange rates  primarily related to the stronger euro and brazilian real versus the us dollar  increased sales volumes and somewhat higher average selling prices 
compared to  total sales volume increased percent 
sales volumes for the french businesses decreased percent and sales volumes for the brazilian business increased percent while us sales volumes increased percent 
operating profit was million  a percent decline 
operating profit was unfavorably affected by mix of products sold and higher costs for purchased energy  wood pulp  chemicals  employee benefits  labor expenses and currency rates partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and lower nonmanufacturing costs 
the effective income tax rate was percent compared to percent for minority interest decreased by million from because of decreased profitability at ltr industries 
net income was million  a percent decrease compared to diluted earnings per share declined by  or percent  to 
four factors had a significant impact on our financial results  with a negative effect of per share 
inflationary cost increases had an unfavorable impact of per share  approximately one half of which was related to the increased cost of purchased energy 
as a result of difficult market conditions  we were unable to offset these inflationary cost increases through higher selling prices and reduced costs 
throughout  the strengthening brazilian currency had an unfavorable impact of per share 
a higher effective income tax rate had a negative impact of per share compared to interest expense was higher due to increased interest rates and slightly higher average debt due primarily to increased working capital 
higher interest expense reduced earnings by per share 
improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in non manufacturing expense offset about one quarter of these negative impacts on earnings 
strategic initiatives during the year  several strategic initiatives were accomplished which are expected to enhance our market position and benefit our future performance 
in brazil  a new cigarette paper machine was started up and quickly exceeded end of curve projections for production rate and quality 
this new machine gives us the ability to expand market share in latin america and increase export sales 
in north america  the demand for cigarette paper for lower ignition propensity cigarettes continues to grow  with national introduction of these cigarettes in canada in october 
additional states will be requiring the sale of these cigarettes in and we acquired tobacco related paper manufacturing assets in the philippines for million  including working capital 
this acquisition  combined with our indonesian operation  gives us the ability to grow our business in the southeast asian market 
an agreement was reached with the china state tobacco monopoly administration to form a joint venture to construct and operate a two machine paper mill to manufacture tobacco related papers 
start up is expected in opportunities and challenges the challenge we have is to resume the previous trend of earnings growth accomplished during the period the following are our areas of focus increased sales of reconstituted tobacco leaf rtl products 
we expanded our capacity for manufacturing this product with the start up of a new production line in spay  france during the fourth quarter of with the added capacity  our rtl sales volume grew percent in  but declined percent in our goal for is to increase rtl sales volume to percent while retaining sales margins 
the increasing demand for lower ignition propensity cigarette papers offers our company a significant opportunity to expand sales of higher margin cigarette papers in north america 
our company has technologies that are commercially proven to meet the test protocol for the extinguishing of unattended cigarettes 
in  california will join new york june  canada october and vermont may in requiring that all cigarettes sold be lower ignition propensity cigarettes 
in  we have set aggressive goals for improving our manufacturing efficiency in producing these papers 
continue upgrading and expanding our operations in southeast asia 
in june  we completed the acquisition of a mill in the philippines with two tobacco related papers machines 
this acquisition complements the acquisition of pt pdm indonesia 
capacity of the tobacco related papers machines at both mills is being expanded  quality improved and costs reduced to better serve the southeast asian markets 
we are targeting significant profit growth from these operations as a objective 
manage french and us paper operations to better respond to declining consumption and excess capacity in the western european and north american markets 
our operations in france and the us are affected by reduced utilization of capacity 
we are studying alternatives to improve the cost structure in both operations and to operate more effectively 
capital spending and working capital levels are being adjusted to reflect the business needs 
implement the joint venture in china 
construction of the two machine mill will begin during the first half of the project and management teams are being assembled with start up expected in early the quality of the teams we install will influence the degree of success of the joint venture 
we have nominated widjaja jiemy  president southeast asian operations to manage the construction and start up of the joint venture 
mr 
jiemy has experience in managing the start up of a new paper mill in indonesia 
he was leading a greenfield paper mill project in southeast china prior to joining our company 
mr 
jiemy also has extensive experience in managing tobacco related paper operations 
recent developments lee mills operational changes at the lee mills facility  we operate a machine that is owned by kimberly clark 
ownership of the machine was retained by kimberly clark in the spin off of the company and is operated solely for the purpose of producing a proprietary product used as an in process material by kimberly clark 
under the contract for its continued operation  we essentially invoice kimberly clark the actual costs of operating the machine  including allocations of indirect and fixed overhead costs 
while the current term of the contract was scheduled to expire in december  kimberly clark gave notice of early termination on january   which under the contract began an month termination period for the contract now ending in august while certain of the costs currently invoiced to kimberly clark can be eliminated  we may be unable to eliminate a portion of the approximately million of indirect and fixed overhead costs that are currently absorbed by that operation 
as a result  we have begun to evaluate the operational and financial impact that the kimberly clark contract termination  as well as recent changes in tobacco related paper customer sales volume forecasts and lack of profitability for certain commercial and industrial paper grades produced at the lee mills might have on its operations 
while we are still evaluating broader restructuring options  we decided in late february to transfer the production volume from one plug wrap paper machine to another currently under utilized lee mills plug wrap paper machine and to commence accelerated depreciation on the affected equipment 
for more information regarding the lee mills operational changes and the potential ramifications  see property  plant and equipment valuation in the critical accounting policies and estimates section below 
credit agreement on january   we entered into amendment no 
to the credit agreement dated as of january   or the amendment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amendment is among schweitzer mauduit international  inc  schweitzer mauduit france sarl  a french corporation  and a group of banks led by soci t g n rale as agent for the banks 
under the amendment  we renewed our day revolving credit facility under the credit agreement  extending these facilities from january  to january  this amendment also decreased the applicable margin with respect to certain amounts available to us under the day revolvers 
phillip morris supply agreement on december   we announced that we had reached an agreement with philip morris usa inc to continue our strategic supply agreement for fine papers 
the term of the agreement is from january  to december  the strategic supply agreement continues our ongoing supply of tobacco related papers to philip morris usa inc our companies have been operating under a strategic supply agreement since january  china joint venture in july  we announced execution of an agreement to form a joint venture to produce tobacco related papers in china 
the joint venture would build a new state of the art paper mill  with paper machines producing cigarette paper and porous plug wrap in partnership with the cntc  which is the principal operating company under china s stma 
cntc and sm china would each own percent of the joint venture 
the new mill would have an annual capacity of approximately  metric tons and will be located near jiangmen  in the guangdong province 
a year construction period is anticipated  with the mill expected to begin production in the first quarter of project spending  including capital expenditures and working capital requirements  is expected to total approximately million  with each joint venture participant sharing equally in the investment 
pdm would provide technical support and project management 
the joint venture is subject to obtaining project financing and various governmental approvals 
philippines acquisition on june   pdm philippines industries  inc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary and an affiliated company  acquired the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets of kcpi  a philippines company and associated land and water rights 
the acquired assets included buildings  production equipment and related utilities  support assets and inventories 
the total acquisition cost was million  funded through existing bank lines of credit 
the impact of this acquisition on the accompanying consolidated financial statements was not significant 
the production equipment included paper machines  with annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons  and related converting equipment 
product produced at the mill includes cigarette paper  conventional plug wrap and both base and printed tipping paper 
kcpi had engaged in the manufacturing of tobacco related paper products for the philippines cigarette industry since and had an estimated percent market share of the philippines cigarette paper market 
the marketing and sales of ppi products are being integrated with the efforts of our french operations in the southeast asian market 
the acquisition of the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets in the philippines is consistent with our long term strategy for operations in asia 
this purchase will improve our ability to address the needs of our customers in both the philippines and the southeast asian market 
we plan to upgrade the production capabilities of the manufacturing equipment and the quality of the products being produced to better support the demand for tobacco related papers in the region 
lower ignition propensity cigarettes during  canada implemented a requirement for lower cigarette ignition propensity properties for all cigarettes manufactured or imported into canada on or after october  accordingly  a full year of sales of these products in canada is expected during in addition  the states of vermont and california enacted legislation that requires the sale of lower ignition propensity cigarettes effective in may and january  respectively 
we expect to begin supporting the vermont and california requirements during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
industry trends consistent with recent historical trends  worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately one half to one percent per year 
the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production 
age demographics and expected increases in disposable income will support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries 
in addition  the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states  having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes  which  in turn  affects cigarette consumption 
cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of lower cigarette exports and a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices  health concerns and public perceptions 
as well  cigarette consumption has declined in western europe following recent tax increases on cigarette sales 
the cigarette paper market in western europe has become more competitive  with pressure on both sales volumes and selling prices  caused by reduced cigarette consumption in several large european markets and new cigarette paper manufacturing capacity that was added in western europe in mid in developing countries  there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes  which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers  such as those we produce  and reconstituted tobacco leaf 
this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers 
based on these trends  we expect worldwide demand for tobacco related papers and reconstituted tobacco leaf products to continue to increase  with a shift from developed countries to developing countries 
as a result  we are increasing some of our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil  the philippines and indonesia 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies 
following are critical accounting matters  which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the estimates and judgments made for each of these items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements 
the accounting for these matters was based on current facts and circumstances which  in our judgment  hold potential for change which could affect our future estimates such that future financial results could differ materially from financial results based on management s current estimates 
our critical accounting policies and estimates arise in conjunction with the following income tax expense and accruals pension benefits expense and accruals litigation contingencies property  plant and equipment valuation accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we record and maintain income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have available net operating loss carryforwards  excess foreign tax credit carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which we operate  for which we have recorded deferred tax assets totaling million as of december  certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a manner beneficial to our financial results prior to their expiration 
as a result  as of december   we have million of valuation allowances against certain of the deferred tax assets  as follows dollars in millions total asset valuation allowance net asset net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credit carryforwards federal research and us states tax credit carryforwards federal amt credit carryforwards under current tax laws governing jurisdictions in which we have net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  remaining nols in france and brazil carry forward indefinitely and nols in spain expire years subsequent to the year generated 
we expect sufficient future taxable income in france and brazil to fully utilize the respective french and brazilian nols  which carry forward indefinitely and for which no valuation allowances have been recorded as of december  the remaining nols at december  in spain will fully expire in if not utilized against taxable income in spain 
valuation allowances related to nols in spain totaled million as of december   fully reserving the related deferred tax asset in spain  since we believe that it is reasonably likely that we will not generate taxable income in spain prior to the expiration of these nols  as sm spain only functions as the primary foreign investment holding company for us 
we receive credits in our us federal income tax return for income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions 
income from foreign sources  including dividend income paid from foreign subsidiaries  is included in taxable income of the us parent 
in some cases  the amount of credits realized in the tax return is more or less than the tax owed on the foreign source income 
when the amount of credits exceeds the amount of taxes owed on that foreign source income  foreign tax credit carryforwards are generated 
when the credits are less than the tax owed  unexpired credit carryforwards from prior years can be utilized in certain circumstances 
these circumstances are dependent upon both foreign source and domestic taxable income 
due to the recent low level of the us business unit s profitability  we have implemented certain income tax elections to accelerate taxable income or to delay deductions in order to maintain positive domestic taxable income or to minimize a domestic taxable loss eg our election to capitalize research costs in the year incurred for us income tax purposes and amortize over a year life  as opposed to taking the income tax deduction in the year incurred 
however  many such actions cannot be repeated in future years and certain of those elections may make it more difficult to have positive domestic taxable income in future periods 
the profitability of our us business operations must improve to provide us an opportunity to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards in the future in a manner that will be beneficial to our financial results 
however  the american jobs creation act of increased the carryforward period of foreign tax credits from to years 
based on this extension of the carryforward period  together with the current and forecasted profitability of our us business operations and the requirements of the foreign source income and credit calculations  we currently believe that we will partially utilize the foreign tax credit carryforwards in an earnings beneficial manner prior to their expiration and  therefore  we have partially reserved these deferred tax assets as of december  with million of valuation allowances  reducing the net deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate we will be able to realize 
we regularly update our estimates of domestic taxable income in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets 
likewise  our carryforwards of federal research credits and us state tax credits require applicable taxable income in the respective tax returns in order to be utilized prior to their expirations 
we expect that we will be able to fully utilize our federal research credits  which have a year carryforward period  prior to their expiration 
however  we do not currently expect sufficient future taxable income in our us state income tax returns to be able to utilize all of our state tax credits prior to their expiration  primarily in new york and new jersey  where the carryforward periods are and years  respectively  and credit utilization is limited to percent of the income tax liability 
as a result  we have million of valuation allowances reducing our deferred tax assets to amounts that we estimate we will be able to realize 
we regularly update these estimates in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets 
under current us tax law  federal alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards have no expiration 
we believe that profitability will improve in our us operations in future years 
since the federal amt credit carryforwards have no expiration  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the full benefit of these credits in future years  and thus we do not believe any valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets is appropriate as of december  in summary  of our valuation allowances at december   million relates to nols in spain  million relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards for purposes of us federal income taxes and million relates to us state credits 
we do not expect to generate taxable income in spain prior to expiration of nols in that jurisdiction 
the million related to foreign tax credits and the million related to state tax credits are dependent upon taxable income in the united states 
we do anticipate increased profitability in the united states in the future  but not in sufficient enough amounts to fully realize these deferred tax assets in a beneficial manner prior to the expiration of the underlying credits 
it is possible that our estimates of future profitability in the united states could change from our current estimates based on business results or actions taken by us which effect taxable income 
while we do not currently believe it is likely that a material change will occur  it is possible that changes in these factors  changes in the level of foreign source income or a change in the likelihood of foreign tax credit utilization in an earnings beneficial manner  could result in an adjustment of our valuation allowances in future periods 
due to the number of uncertain factors and the complexities of the calculations  it is not possible to reasonably estimate what future impact could occur 
while we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of estimated net deferred income tax benefits  it is possible that the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could change  which could result in additional income tax expense in the future to increase the associated valuation allowances 
however  we continue to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved and  therefore  it is also possible that changes in the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could benefit us in the future by some of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december  for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension accounting we recognize the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to us in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
our earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits  which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits 
each year s recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations for our various plans 
the calculations of pension benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts  including the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the projected rate of future compensation increases 
we evaluate these assumptions at least once each year  or as facts and circumstances dictate  and make changes as conditions warrant 
we determine these actuarial assumptions  after consultation with our actuaries  on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported income  which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities 
we believe that our selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for our plans and experience 
in july  the decision was made and communicated to all affected us salaried employees that benefits related to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states will be frozen as of december  this action is expected to reduce our annual pension expense and pension fund contribution requirements 
the plan has not been terminated and benefits accrued as of december  will continue to be paid in accordance with the plan terms 
allowable employee contributions and our employer matching percentage for our defined contribution  or k  plan are being modified to partially offset the resulting salaried employee pension benefit reduction 
our us employee pension plans accounted for approximately percent of our total pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligations  as of december  the table below shows the assumptions that we used and will use to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the discount rates used for our determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for our us employee pension plans fluctuate from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments 
we also evaluate the expected average duration of our pension obligations in determining our discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is determined based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash flows 
a change in the discount rate assumption of percent would change our estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating historical and projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market indices as well as the projected investment mix of our pension assets 
actual rates of return loss earned on us pension plan assets  net of expense  for each of the last years  the period of time we have managed our pension assets were year return we utilized a monte carlo simulation analysis on the target us pension asset investment mix to determine our expected return on plan assets for  and for  we will maintain the expected rate of return on plan assets at percent  the same as for the current asset allocation policy of our us employee pension plan targets an allocation of percent in equity securities  percent in fixed income securities and percent in other investments 
a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of percent would change the estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the rate of annual compensation increase is directly related to negotiated union contracts for our us hourly employees 
us salaried employees will not earn additional benefits for future service beginning january  despite our belief that the estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results will likely differ from our estimates  and these differences could materially affect the future financial statements either favorably or unfavorably 
additionally  it is possible that assets of our plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns  which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations  could result in us being required to make significant cash contributions to the plans in future periods 
for additional information regarding pension plan assets  benefit obligations and accounting assumptions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation contingencies we evaluate contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  when a material loss contingency exists  we accrue an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made  disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 
gains that might result from resolution of contingencies are not recorded until all contingencies have been resolved  although disclosure is generally made regarding material gain contingencies 
imposto sobre circula o de mercadorias e servi os  or icms  a form of value added tax in brazil  was assessed to swm b in december of  or the assessment 
as of december   the assessment  comprised of separate assessments  totaled approximately million  of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification agreement with the former owner of the predecessor of swm b  for a net exposure of approximately million 
in  the courts granted swm b relief from having to bond the potential tax liability while we challenge the assessment 
in august and november  the judges hearing the challenges in the state of rio de janeiro ruled in swm b s favor in its suits to vacate the assessment  affirming the bases of swm b s legal challenges of the assessment 
while the favorable decisions by the judges with respect to the assessment provided further support for swm b s positions  these decisions were automatically appealed  as provided for under brazilian legislation for cases involving an adverse financial outcome for the government in lower courts 
in june  the st civil chamber of the court of appeals of the state of rio de janeiro granted the appeal of the lower court s decision annulling one of the assessments against swm b 
the appellate court reached its decision based on a majority vote of the judge panel  with judge issuing a written dissenting opinion 
based on this dissenting opinion  in june  swm b appealed to a different civil chamber 
in march  the th civil chamber of the court of appeals of the state of rio de janeiro also denied swm b s appeal based on a majority vote 
in june  swm b appealed to the superior court of justice and the federal supreme court of brazil 
in november  swm b filed a preliminary injunction at the superior court of justice in order to prevent the enforcement of this assessment 
the superior court of justice granted swm b an order to suspend the enforcement of this assessment until the ruling of the case by the court 
with regard to the other assessment  in august  the th civil chamber of the court of appeals of the state of rio de janeiro entered an order denying the state of rio de janeiro s appeal of the lower court s decision annulling this assessment against swm b 
the state of rio de janeiro appealed this favorable decision to the superior court of justice  which denied the appeal in august the state of rio de janeiro is now expected to appeal to the federal supreme court of brazil 
swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes the final resolution of this matter will entail judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved for several years 
our current evaluation of the matter is that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood and no reserve has been provided for this contingent liability 
however  there is a reasonable possibility that swm b will ultimately be required to pay all or a portion of this contingent liability  which could adversely impact our future financial results or financial condition 
in february  swm b filed suit against the state of rio de janeiro to recover icms credits previously reversed in following receipt of the assessment 
after the assessment was filed against us  swm b changed its procedures and did not utilize icms tax credits through the end of production and sale of immune papers during as a result of the favorable developments during mentioned above with respect to the assessment  swm b petitioned the court for permission to offset approximately million of overpaid icms taxes against current tax liabilities 
during march  the court rejected swm b s claim  which decision swm b has appealed 
although swm b believes it has a reasonable chance of success in this case  no asset has been recorded for this potential recovery 
imposto sobre produtos industrializados  or ipi  a form of federal value added tax in brazil 
schweitzer mauduit do brasil v 
federal union  federal regional tribunal sitting in rio de janeiro  case number 
march  
swm b instituted this action in order to recover credits on past and future purchases of raw materials that are exempt from ipi taxes or that carry an ipi tax rate of 
the recovery would be in the form of presumed credits that could be applied to offset other ipi tax liabilities 
the action for recovery is based on the principle in brazilian law of non cumulative taxes 
the brazilian supreme court decided favorably in the case of materials with tax exemption 
they considered that the acquisition of exempt material generated the right to the credit as if there was no exemption 
the legal thesis would be the same for non taxed materials and taxed materials 
independent of swm b s action  the brazilian department of justice has prepared a brief contesting the supreme court s decisions on ipi credits  arguing for reversal on the grounds that the supreme court s decisions on the ipi presumed tax credits effectively fashioned new law concerning the application of the principle of the non cumulation of taxes and did not interpret existing law  such action being outside the jurisdiction of the court 
while the government s arguments may be well founded  it is considered unlikely that the supreme court will reverse itself on these recent rulings which passed with a strong majority vote of the judges 
however  a number of new judges have joined the supreme court and there are significant social implications to the potential lost revenue for the government 
swm b received a favorable ruling on the merits of its claim 
the only unfavorable aspect of the decision was a denial of swm b s claim to include purchases of electricity and natural gas as raw materials on which it could generate credits 
swm b petitioned the court to amend its ruling in this regard and the court denied swm b s petition 
swm b appealed this decision to the federal tribunal  where the case is presently pending 
the potential recovery of ipi credits  depending upon several contested factors  could be in the range of million to million  which amounts we consider a gain contingency and have not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have a good chance of recovery 
however  the final resolution of this matter may entail judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved for several years 
for further information please see litigation in part i  item  legal proceedings 
property  plant and equipment valuation paper manufacturing  which is our primary manufacturing process  is a mature and capital intensive process 
as a result  we make substantial investments in property  plant and equipment which are recorded at cost 
the cost of depreciable property  plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes over the depreciable lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on estimates of the useful lives of the assets  that is the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of the asset 
paper machines and related equipment are not readily obsoleted and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years 
we periodically assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related operations 
these factors  along with management s plans with respect to the operations  are considered in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment 
facts and circumstances upon which management s estimates and plans are based could change  thus the possibility exists of a material adjustment to our financial statements in the future 
as a result of current excess capacity in the tobacco related papers industry and increased operating costs experienced in the last to months  particularly related to purchased energy  competitive levels of selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that we consider reasonable 
such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and  in some cases  accelerated depreciation of certain equipment 
management is evaluating how to operate our production facilities more effectively with reduced tobacco related papers volumes 
changes are possible that might require write offs or accelerated depreciation of some equipment and could possibly include charges for employee related costs associated with possible downsizing activities  particularly in the united states or france 
in the united states  banded cigarette paper production assets at the spotswood mill are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years  although that product  utilized in lower ignition propensity cigarettes  has not yet been widely commercialized 
certain of these assets remain underutilized and likely would otherwise be shut down except that we have a contractual commitment to stand ready to produce commercial quantities of that product for our customer 
partially offsetting the net book value of these assets is an unamortized deferred revenue which is being amortized to revenue as product is being purchased by that customer 
further  certain of the infrastructure improvements and other assets installed to be able to produce commercial quantities of banded cigarette paper would still be used by a scaled down operation even if we stopped manufacture of that product 
as of december   the net book value of spotswood mill property  plant and equipment was million  of which million related to year life banded cigarette paper specific assets and million related to paper machines capable of producing banded cigarette paper  but not currently in operation 
as of december   unamortized deferred revenue was million 
with the current competitive levels of selling prices for tobacco related and other fine papers  we are evaluating to which of these products we want to continue to commit our resources 
a significant portion of the products manufactured at the lee mills are commercial and industrial papers 
our machines that make these papers are smaller machines than those of some of our competitors in those markets 
as a result  our cost of manufacture for those products can be higher than those of competitors and thus our margins lower than we desire 
due to significant inflationary cost increases during and  primarily from purchased energy  labor and employee benefit costs  the lee mills incurred operating losses 
at the lee mills facility  we also operate a machine that is owned by kimberly clark 
ownership of the machine was retained by kimberly clark in the spin off of the company and is operated solely for the purpose of producing a proprietary product used as an in process material by kimberly clark 
under the contract for its continued operation  we essentially invoice kimberly clark the actual costs of operating the machine  including allocations of indirect and fixed overhead costs 
while the current term of the contract was scheduled to expire in december  kimberly clark gave notice of early termination on january   which under the contract began an month termination period for the contract now ending in august while certain of the costs currently invoiced to kimberly clark can be eliminated  we may be unable to eliminate a portion of the approximately million of indirect and fixed overhead costs that are currently absorbed by that operation 
management has begun to evaluate the impact that the kimberly clark contract termination in august  recent changes in tobacco related paper customer sales volume forecasts and lack of profitability for certain commercial and industrial papers may have on the operations of the lee mills 
while we are still evaluating broader restructuring options  we decided in late february to transfer the production volume from one plug wrap paper machine  currently carried at million and for which accelerated depreciation of approximately million will be taken during each of the next years  to another currently under utilized lee mills plug wrap paper machine 
additional changes are possible at lee mills that might require further accelerated depreciation or write offs of some equipment and could possibly include charges for employee related costs associated with downsizing activities 
as of december   the net book value of lee mills property  plant and equipment was million 
in france  a recent downturn in demand for some of our tobacco related products has resulted from a decrease in consumption of cigarettes in certain countries as a result of increased taxes and regulations on the cigarette industry and new tobacco related papers capacity that began operation in europe in and this has created a very competitive pricing environment during a time of high inflationary cost increases 
this downturn in demand for our products has caused us to have excess capacity and increased machine downtime at the present time 
based on these current competitive circumstances  as well as possible future implications to our existing operations  management is evaluating how to operate our production facilities in france more effectively 
although no decisions have been made  changes are possible that might require write offs or accelerated depreciation of some equipment and could possibly include charges for employee related costs associated with possible downsizing activities

 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas  or sfas sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that these costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they are abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of manufacturing be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect this new standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  this statement requires companies to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  and amortize that amount over the option s vesting period as an expense through the income statement 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see share based incentive compensation in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts for fiscal through fiscal  where we used a fair value based method under sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
the implementation of this statement will be effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the impact of this new pronouncement to be significant to our results of operations

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
we were required to adopt the provisions of fin no

it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas as of the beginning of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

our credit agreement covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios  as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends  and we do not currently anticipate any change in business conditions of a nature that would cause future restrictions on dividend payments as a result of our need to maintain these financial ratios

interest rates 
under the credit agreement  interest rates are at market rates  based on the london interbank offered rate for us dollar deposits  or libor  for the us dollar borrowings and the euro zone interbank offered rate for euro deposits  or euribor  for the euro borrowings plus either a for day revolver borrowings  an applicable margin of either percent per annum or percent per annum  or b for year revolver borrowings  an applicable margin of either percent per annum or percent per annum 
the applicable margin is determined in each instance by reference to our net debt to equity ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
in the past  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable component of certain of our variable rate long term debt when economical to do so 
we did not enter into any interest rate related derivative contract agreements during the years through and as of december  we did not have any interest rate swap agreements in place 
covenants 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that  among other things  require us to maintain certain defined financial ratios as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements wherein the credit agreement is more fully described

the share repurchases were made under a board of directors authorization covering the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million 
the share repurchases were made under a prior board of directors authorization 
corporate b plans are used by us so that share repurchases can be made at predetermined stock price levels  without restricting such repurchases to specific windows of time 
future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon various factors  including the stock price  strategic opportunities and cash availability 
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefits 
after being in a net overfunded position in and prior years  our us and french pension plans changed to an underfunded status in as a result of the poor performance of the equities markets and lower interest rates that caused estimated future pension liabilities to increase because of the necessity to use a lower discount rate 
the underfunded pension status has continued since see additional disclosure regarding our pension plans in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  interest rates continued to decline  but the equities markets improved and we made pension contributions of million in the united states and france

other commitments 
our mill in quimperle  france has a minimum annual commitment for calcium carbonate purchases  a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products  which totals million per year 
our future purchases at this mill are expected to be at levels that exceed such minimum levels under the contract 
the current calcium carbonate contract expires in  although a tentative agreement has been reached to extend the purchase agreement by an additional years 
in march  ltri  our percent indirectly owned subsidiary in france  entered into an agreement with an energy cogeneration supplier whereby the supplier will construct and operate a cogeneration facility at the ltri mill and supply steam which will be used in the operation of the mill 
in april  a similar agreement was entered into with the same supplier to install and operate a cogeneration facility at pdm 
these agreements are expected to reduce the energy cost of these mills 
the construction phase of the ltri cogeneration facility was completed late in and the construction of the pdm cogeneration facility should be completed in late  with the supplier bearing the capital cost of both projects 
following start up of these facilities  ltri and pdm will be committed to purchasing minimum annual amounts of steam generated by each of these facilities for a period of years under the agreements

since our debt is largely variable interest rate debt  applicable market interest rates were assumed to be the same as at december  for purposes of these calculations 
with respect to our variable rate debt outstanding at december   a percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our debt interest obligation by million in for more information regarding our outstanding debt and associated interest rates  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements

project spending of the joint venture  including capital expenditures and working capital requirements  is expected to total approximately million  with swm and cntc each sharing equally in the equity investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture is expected to have a capital structure of approximately one third equity and two thirds debt  with project financing being obtained by the joint venture itself 
as of december   the joint venture was still subject to obtaining project financing and various governmental approvals and  therefore  no funding obligations existed at that date

outlook consistent with recent historical trends  worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately one half to one percent per year 
the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production 
age demographics and expected increases in disposable income are expected to support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries 
in addition  the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states  having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes  which  in turn  affects cigarette consumption 
cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of reduced cigarette exports and a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices  health concerns and public perceptions 
as well  cigarette consumption has declined in western europe following recent tax increases on cigarette sales 
we are experiencing weakness in our tobacco related paper sales in our french and us operations 
this anticipated weakness in both sales volumes and selling prices is the result of reduced cigarette consumption  in part due to increased taxes  and a surplus of cigarette paper manufacturing capacity as a result of capacity additions by european competitors in and as a result of this market weakness  we will continue to incur paper machine downtime in each of our business segments 
the weakness in tobacco related paper sales is expected to be partially offset by increased sales of reconstituted tobacco leaf products 
management is evaluating how to operate our production facilities more effectively with the reduced tobacco related papers volumes 
during late february  we decided to transfer the production volume from one plug wrap paper machine  currently carried at million and for which accelerated depreciation of approximately million will be taken during each of the next years  to another currently under utilized lee mills paper machine 
additional changes are possible that might require further accelerated depreciation or write offs of some equipment and could possibly include charges for employee related costs associated with possible downsizing activities  particularly in the united states or france 
in developing countries  there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes  which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers  such as those we produce  and reconstituted tobacco leaf 
this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers 
based on these trends  we expect worldwide demand for tobacco related papers and reconstituted tobacco leaf products to continue to increase  with a shift from developed countries to developing countries 
as a result  we have increased our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil  the philippines and indonesia 
sales of cigarette papers for lower ignition propensity cigarettes are expected to contribute positively to operating results in  as momentum continues to build for these products 
canada implemented a requirement for lower cigarette ignition propensity properties for all cigarettes manufactured or imported into canada on or after october  accordingly  a full year of sales of these products in canada is expected during in addition  the states of vermont and california enacted legislation that requires lower ignition propensity cigarettes for all cigarettes sold in those states beginning in may and january  respectively 
we expect to begin supporting the vermont and california requirements during the second and fourth quarters of this year  respectively 
these papers sell for a higher price than the conventional cigarette papers they replace and are expected to have a positive impact on our financial results 
during  we will continue to upgrade  expand and integrate the operations that we acquired during the past years in the philippines and indonesia 
we will also embark upon the construction of our tobacco related papers joint venture mill in china 
governmental approval for the chinese joint venture was obtained in late and we are in the process of finalizing project financing and obtaining various governmental permits 
the mill is expected to begin operations in early cost pressures are expected to continue in  reflected in higher purchased energy  purchased materials  labor and employee benefit expenses 
a portion of these cost increases will be offset through cost reduction efforts in our operations and through somewhat higher selling prices 
the weakened dollar is expected to continue to put pressure on our profitability in brazil  similar to our effective income tax rate is expected to be to percent in  approximately at the level 
interest expense is expected to be marginally higher in than in  reflecting higher average interest rates 
with the current market conditions and inflationary cost increases  it is difficult to project how successful we will be in improving our operating margins during we are pursuing selling price increases and opportunities for increased sales volumes 
we are evaluating how to operate our production facilities more effectively with reduced tobacco related papers volume  while lowering the manufacturing cost of cigarette paper for lower ignition propensity cigarettes 
we are also controlling nonmanufacturing and operating expenses to partially offset the inflationary cost increases 
our capital spending is being managed at a reduced level  with an emphasis on projects that will most immediately contribute to improved earnings 
we currently expect our capital spending for to be approximately to million 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
these statements include those in the outlook and critical accounting policies and estimates sections and our expectations elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and in factors that may affect future results under risk factors in item a 
they also include statements containing expect  anticipate  project  appears  should  could  may  typically and similar words 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these statements for a number of reasons  including the following we have manufacturing facilities in countries and sell products in over countries 
as a result  we are subject to a variety of import and export  tax  foreign currency  labor and other regulations within these countries 
changes in these regulations  or adverse interpretations or applications  as well as changes in currency exchange rates  could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways  including increasing expenses  decreasing sales  limiting our ability to repatriate funds and generally limiting our ability to conduct business 
our financial performance is dependent upon the cost of raw materials  particularly wood pulp  purchased energy  chemicals and labor 
recently the cost of these items has increased significantly  and the nature of our agreements with our customers may make it difficult to pass changes in these costs on to our customers in a timely and effective manner 
our sales are concentrated to a limited number of customers 
in  percent of our sales were to our largest customers 
the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our financial performance is materially impacted by sales of both reconstituted tobacco leaf products and lower ignition propensity cigarette papers 
a significant change in the sales volumes  pricing or manufacturing costs of these products could have a material impact on future financial results 
as a result of current excess capacity in the tobacco related papers industry and increased operating costs experienced in the last to months  particularly related to purchased energy  competitive levels of selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that we consider reasonable 
such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and  in some cases  accelerated depreciation of certain equipment 
management is evaluating how to operate our production facilities more effectively with reduced tobacco related papers volumes 
changes are possible that might require accelerated depreciation or write offs of some equipment and could possibly include charges for employee related costs associated with possible downsizing activities  particularly in the united states or france 
in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports with respect to the possible harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products  to limit smoking in public places and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in north america  have enacted  considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
furthermore  it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect our business
