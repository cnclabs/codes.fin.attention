item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report 
introduction ct communications  inc and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of telecommunications and related services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
the company s primary services include local and long distance telephone service  internet and data services and wireless products and services 
the company has worked to expand its core businesses through the development of integrated product and service offerings  investment in growth initiatives that exceed certain return thresholds and targeted marketing efforts to efficiently identify and obtain customers 
in addition  the company has made certain strategic investments intended to complement its core businesses 
during  the company completed its previously announced plan to enhance the broadband capabilities in its ilec territory 
the company can now offer broadband speeds of up to mbps throughout much of its ilec service area 
broadband customer growth has continued to accelerate in the ilec with the availability of higher bandwidth services 
during  the company added  dsl customers to end the year with  a increase from december  dsl penetration was of ilec lines and of greenfield lines at december  maintaining superior broadband service capabilities has and will continue to be central to the company s on going competitive strategy 
the company also continues to focus on maximizing the ilec business in its current markets by cross selling bundled products and packages and growing its customer base through its clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and wireless businesses 
during  operating revenue increased to million  while operating income decreased to million compared to wireless operating revenue increased from to million with a increase in net customers 
the company s ilec continued to experience a loss of access lines as its customers selected from several alternative service providers 
the competitive greenfield and clec wireline businesses experienced access line growth of and  respectively 
the replacement of higher margin ilec lines with lower margin clec and greenfield lines will continue to pressure operating margins downward 
however  the company is continuously evaluating opportunities for process improvements and efficiency gains to offset the transition to competitive  lower margin accounts 
operating margins in the clec and greenfield businesses should continue to be positively impacted as the company leverages existing transport infrastructure to support new customers 
net income for the company was million in  million in  and million in income from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  and in  and  respectively 
during  the company anticipates a significant increase in competition in its ilec territory due to the expected launch of cable telephony service 
the company has been working internally and with consultants to develop the next evolution of its network architecture and the services that will be delivered over its network 
the plan will define the voice  data  video and entertainment products and services to be delivered to the company s customers  as well as the network design and bandwidth necessary to provide those products and services 
the company expects to complete this product  service and network plan in the next several months to build upon the network enhancements completed in in addition  the company is developing plans to transition from a circuit switched network technology to an ip technology capable of delivering these products and services 
after complete transition  the company believes an ip network design will result in expanded service capabilities that can be delivered at lower costs 

table of contents industry and operating trends the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and characterized by increasing price competition  technological development and regulatory uncertainty 
industry participants are faced with the challenge of adapting their organizations  services  processes and systems to this environment 
the company s ilec is facing more competitive pressure than at any other time in its history 
wireless providers and clecs have targeted the company s customers and will continue to promote low cost  flexible communications alternatives 
cable telephony and voice over internet protocol voip providers are significant threats to the company s business 
service providers utilizing these technologies are capable of delivering a competitive voice service to the company s customers 
these service providers are not subject to certain regulatory constraints that have impacted the company s business model and will become more significant impediments to its ability to successfully compete in the coming years 
the ilec must provide basic telephone service as well as most tariffed services to all customers in its regulated service area  regardless of the cost to provide those services 
although the company does benefit from certain universal service fund usf payments intended to offset certain costs to provide service  such reimbursements are increasingly at risk while the service obligations remain unchanged 
voip and cable telephony are becoming more available to customers and could result in increased customer churn throughout the company s businesses 
time warner currently offers cable television and high speed internet service in much of the company s service territory and cable telephony service in many of the company s greenfield and clec areas 
time warner is expected to offer cable telephony in the ilec service area in early cable telephony in the ilec service area could result in a loss of access lines  a reduction in ilec revenue including long distance and access revenue and a reduction in internet revenue 
in addition  wireless substitution is also a trend that is impacting the ilec business as well as the company s long distance revenue 
some customers are choosing to substitute their landline service with wireless service 
the company believes this has contributed to the access line decrease in the ilec over the past several years 
access line losses in recent years have also been impacted by the adoption of dsl and other high speed internet services by customers that had traditionally subscribed to dial up internet service 
as customers switch to dsl or other high speed internet services  they no longer need a second landline for use with their dial up internet service 
if such landline is replaced with a company dsl line  then the company can offset  at least partially  the lost landline revenue through its dsl service to the customer 
in the company s wireless business  increasing competition has caused and will likely continue to cause the wireless industry s subscriber growth rate to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates 
while the wireless telecommunications industry does continue to grow  a high degree of competition exists among carriers 
this competition will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as carriers compete for customers 
future carrier revenue growth is highly dependent upon the number of net customer additions a carrier can achieve and the average revenue per user derived from its customers 
regulatory requirements have grown in certain areas of the company s business and have added complexity and expense to its business model 
the company s telecommunications services are regulated by the fcc at the federal level  and state utility commissions  principally the ncuc 
the fcc frequently undertakes matters that could have a significant impact on the company 
the fcc is in the process of evaluating the current usf and intercarrier compensation structures 
these sources of revenue have been under increasing pressure and scrutiny  and many have expressed concerns over the continued viability of the usf program as currently configured 
intercarrier compensation  which is also received by the company s clec and greenfield businesses  has also been subject to increasing pressures due to the introduction of new technologies  such as voip  that many carriers have utilized in an attempt to avoid the payment of appropriate access charges 
concord telephone currently receives a material portion of its revenue from the usf  in the form of icls  and from intercarrier compensation 
the fcc  and possibly congress  is expected to devote resources to the consideration of usf and intercarrier compensation reform in and future years  and it is possible that action taken by those governmental entities would result in a reduction in the amount of revenue concord telephone receives from those sources 
on february   the fcc announced adoption of a further notice of proposed rule making for 
table of contents intercarrier compensation reform and subsequently issued a press release 
the text of the fcc s notice was released on march  initial comments were filed in may and reply comments were filed on july  the company is currently participating in industry associations that are working to develop and advocate an industry proposal 
the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory treatment of voip services 
despite providing voice services similar to those offered by the company  voip providers have to date avoided many regulatory requirements that currently apply to the company in the provision of those services 
this disparate regulatory treatment provides voip providers with a competitive advantage 
although several state commissions have attempted to assert jurisdiction over voip services  federal courts in new york and minnesota have rejected those efforts as preempted by federal law 
on november   the fcc ruled that internet based service provided by vonage holdings corporation vonage should be subject to federal rather than state jurisdiction 
several state commissions have appealed the fcc s vonage decision 
on february   the fcc announced a rulemaking to examine whether certain regulatory requirements  such as services  universal service  disability access and access charges  should be applicable to voip services 
on march   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the appropriate regulatory treatment of ip enabled communications services 
on june   the fcc released an order requiring voip providers to provide service to their customers in the fourth quarter of since september  the ilec s rates for local exchange services have been established under a price regulation plan approved by the ncuc 
under the price regulation plan  the company s charges are no longer subject to rate base  rate of return regulation 
the price regulation plan has allowed flexibility for adjustments based on certain external events outside of the company s control  such as jurisdictional cost shifts or legislative mandates 
in previous years  the company has rebalanced certain rates under the price regulation plan with the primary result being an increase in the monthly basic service charges paid by residential customers  a decrease in access charges paid by interexchange carriers and a decrease in rates paid by end users for an expanded local calling scope 
in december  the company filed a petition with the ncuc in which it requested  among other things  deregulation of certain competitive services  additional pricing flexibility for regulated services  elimination of a productivity offset and an initial  limited increase in local calling rates in exchange for providing customers with a larger local calling scope 
on september   the ncuc released an order approving many of the modifications requested by the company 
the approved modifications eliminate a restriction on rate adjustments resulting in recovery increases that exceed the rate of inflation less a productivity offset  allow the company to increase rates annually for basic local exchange services up to and allow the company to increase rates for more competitive services by up to annually 
the company s new price regulation plan also permits annual  total revenue increases of up to times the change in inflation 
the plan further allows the company to increase or decrease prices on an annual basis  and to make additional price changes in certain circumstances to meet competitive offerings 
in exchange for this increased flexibility  the company agreed to certain financial penalties if it fails to meet service quality standards established by the commission 
as its first step under this new plan  on september  the company submitted an annual filing seeking approval for  among other things  local service rate increases in exchange for providing ilec customers with a larger local calling scope that does not require the payment of usage charges 
such rate changes were effective beginning in late october  and will result in simpler calling plans and billing 
the company believes that the new plan will permit it to more effectively address increasing competition in its ilec market  but otherwise does not anticipate that the changes will have a material impact on its financial results 
the company s clec relies in part on unbundled network elements obtained from the applicable incumbent local exchange carrier 
the fcc has relieved some of the unbundling obligations on incumbent local exchange carriers that required those carriers to make some of such elements available at cost based rates 
the fcc s order will result in increases in the cost of some of the unbundled network elements currently leased by the company from incumbent local exchange carriers  including high capacity transport elements and unbundled network element platform une p 
the company has identified  and is continuing to evaluate  opportunities to use alternative transport elements to minimize cost increases relating to the company s use of high capacity transport elements 

table of contents the company also has executed commercial agreements with the incumbent local exchange carriers that will continue to permit the company to maintain and lease additional une p lines from the applicable incumbent at higher rates than the previous cost based rates 
in addition  the company continues to pursue opportunities to expand its network facilities to bring currently leased elements on to the company s network in order to lower expenses and improve service levels 
the company is also targeting new clec customers that can be served primarily through the use of the company s own network or co located facilities 
the company has licenses and other rights including lease agreements to certain wireless spectrum  including broadband radio service brs and educational broadband service ebs 
on july   the fcc issued an order that created a new plan for this band  eliminating the use of interleaved channels by brs and ebs licenses and creating distinct band segments for high power operations and low power operations 
the fcc s order also implemented geographic area licensing for all licenses in the band and adopted a three year transitional mechanism for licensees to move to new spectrum assignments 
the fcc s transition mechanism contemplates that a proponent licensee presumably a commercial operator will initiate a transition for an entire major economic area mea  and will bear the costs of the transition for ebs licensees in such mea 
if a mea is not transitioned within the three year period  then the affected channels will be re licensed through an auction procedure 
the amount of consideration  if any  the company would receive in such circumstances has not yet been determined by the fcc 
as described in the company s current report on form k filed with the sec on june   wireless one of north carolina  llc  wavetel nc license corporation  wavetel  llc and wavetel tn  llc the affiliate companies  which are the company s subsidiaries that hold ebs  brs  and related rights  entered into a purchase agreement  dated june   with fixed wireless holdings  llc  an affiliate of clearwire corporation fixed wireless  pursuant to which fixed wireless agreed to purchase all of the affiliate companies brs spectrum licenses and ebs spectrum lease rights for aggregate consideration of up to million in cash 
the closing of the sale is subject to the consent of the ebs spectrum licensors  regulatory approvals  and other customary closing conditions 
the company currently anticipates that the closing of the sale will occur in the first half of as of december   the company has a carrying value of approximately million in ebs and brs spectrum recorded as wireless spectrum held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets

the increase in access and interconnection revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in facility billings and recoveries related to claims for previously disputed access billings during the fourth quarter of partially offsetting these increases in operating revenue was a million reduction in customer recurring revenue 
the decrease in customer recurring revenue was due to a decline in access lines coupled with customers moving to long distance calling plans bundled with basic service plans 
these bundled products should improve the company s ability to retain customers targeted by other providers 
the decline in access lines was due in part to increased competition from wireless and other competitive providers  and an increase in broadband internet adoption by customers that have cancelled second lines previously used for dial up internet service 
during the year ended december   ilec long distance lines in service increased slightly while access lines decreased 
at december   of ilec access lines subscribed to the company s long distance service  up from at december  the stability in long distance lines was driven by the increase in customer acceptance of the company s bundled product offerings  which include flat rate unlimited long distance calling plans 
despite the stability in long distance lines in service  long distance revenue declined 
the decline in long distance revenue was primarily due to lower revenue per minute from the company s flat rate calling plans in conjunction with lower rates for contract renewals for its larger business customers 
although long distance revenue on a per minute basis has been negatively impacted by flat rate calling plans  these bundled plans are expected to reduce churn with respect to these customers

long distance revenue declined due to a reduction in toll revenue as more customers moved to calling plans that include unlimited minutes of use 
the decrease in access lines was due in part to an increase in broadband internet adoption by customers that cancelled second lines previously used for dial up internet service as well as increased competition from wireless and other competitive providers 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in access and interconnection revenue due to an increase in minutes of use on the company s network
