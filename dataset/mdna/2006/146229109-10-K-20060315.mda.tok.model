overview over the past years  carter s has become one of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children s apparel industry 
on july   we acquired oshkosh for a purchase price of million  which included payment for vested stock options the acquisition 
established in  our oshkosh brand is also highly recognized and well known for its high quality apparel for children sizes newborn to the acquisition has increased our market share in the wholesale and retail channels of distribution 
we sell our products under various carter s and oshkosh brands in the wholesale channel  which includes approximately department store  national chain  and specialty store accounts 
additionally  we currently operate carter s and oshkosh brand retail stores located primarily in outlet and strip centers throughout the united states and sell our products in the mass channel under our just one year brand to approximately  target stores and under our child of mine brand to approximately  wal mart stores nationwide 
we also extend our brand reach by licensing our carter s  child of mine  just one year  and oshkosh b gosh and related brand names through domestic licensing arrangements  including licensing of our genuine kids from oshkosh brand to target stores nationwide 
our oshkosh b gosh brand name is also licensed through international licensing arrangements 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million in licensing income  including million from our oshkosh b gosh and genuine kids from oshkosh brands for the period from july  through december  we are currently in the process of integrating the oshkosh business 
our plans are to integrate and grow our oshkosh brand by implementing our core product development and marketing disciplines  leveraging carter s relationships with key wholesale accounts  closing unprofitable stores  leveraging carter s infrastructure and supply chain  and improving the productivity of our oshkosh brand retail stores 
we have reduced the number of oshkosh sub brands and are in the process of simplifying the number of product offerings under our oshkosh brand 
this should allow us to reduce product complexity  focus our efforts on essential  core products  and streamline operations 
since the acquisition  we have closed unprofitable oshkosh lifestyle stores  oshkosh brand retail stores  and plan to close an additional three oshkosh brand retail stores in fiscal we plan to implement various retail store productivity improvements that have been successful in our carter s brand retail stores 
such improvements include more impactful window displays and better product placement and in store marketing programs 
we are also leveraging our existing infrastructure and supply chain expertise to reduce costs 
in december  we closed the oshkosh choloma  honduras sewing facility and recently announced our plans to close the oshkosh uman  mexico sewing facility during the first half of fiscal we intend to place such production primarily with our vendors in the far east 
we are also in the process of integrating retail store operations and various other support functions throughout the company 
as part of financing the acquisition  we refinanced our existing debt the refinancing  including our former senior credit facility and our outstanding senior subordinated notes due together with the acquisition  the transaction 
in connection with the refinancing  we paid a million redemption premium on the company s senior subordinated notes  we wrote off million in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the former senior credit facility and repayment of the senior subordinated notes  and expensed million related to the debt discount on the senior subordinated notes 
additionally  we expensed approximately million of debt issuance costs associated with our new senior credit facility in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no

as a result of the transaction  we have had a significant increase in interest costs with average borrowings of million at an effective interest rate of for the period from january  through july  and average borrowings of million at an effective interest rate of subsequent to the transaction 
additionally  we have acquired certain indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of oshkosh including licensing agreements and leasehold interests which will result in annual amortization expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal effective january   we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is estimated to result in a reduction in fiscal net income of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  i selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales and ii the number of retail stores open at the end of each period fiscal years wholesale sales carter s oshkosh total wholesale sales retail store sales carter s oshkosh total retail store sales mass channel sales consolidated net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses closure costs royalty income operating income loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income number of retail stores at end of period carter s oshkosh total fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended january  consolidated net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of million  or compared to million in fiscal this increase reflects growth in all channels of distribution and includes million in net sales from oshkosh during the period from july  through december  for the fiscal year ended dollars in thousands december  of total january  of total net sales wholesale carter s wholesale oshkosh retail carter s retail oshkosh mass channel carter s total net sales carter s wholesale sales carter s brand wholesale sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
excluding off price sales  carter s brand wholesale sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
the increase in carter s brand wholesale sales  excluding off price sales  was driven by a increase in units shipped and a increase in average revenue per unit as compared to fiscal growth in units shipped was driven primarily by our playclothes product category  which accounted for approximately of total carter s brand wholesale units shipped in fiscal we continue to focus on strengthening our playclothes products by developing high volume  essential core products in addition to leveraging the brand strength of our baby and sleepwear products 
the increase in average revenue per unit as compared to fiscal was driven primarily by growth in our playclothes product category 
in addition  favorable product mix in our sleepwear category  which accounted for of our carter s brand wholesale units shipped in fiscal  also contributed to the increase in average revenue per unit 
our playclothes and sleepwear product categories both carry higher average prices per unit than our baby product category 
off price sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
off price units shipped were up as compared to fiscal and average revenue per unit was down 
the increase in off price units shipped reflects the disposal of a larger percentage of our excess inventory through the off price channel rather than selling such excess in our retail stores 
this strategy has enabled us to maintain a cleaner mix of higher margin inventory in our carter s brand retail outlet stores 
oshkosh wholesale sales oshkosh brand wholesale sales were million for the period from july  through december   including million in off price sales 
as the acquisition was completed on july   all sales from oshkosh brand products are incremental to our results 
since the acquisition  we have reduced the number of oshkosh wholesale brands from three brands to one brand oskkosh b gosh  significantly reduced the number of styles in order to improve productivity  exited unprofitable and marginally profitable customer relationships  and have begun leveraging our relationships with our key customers to build plans for growth 
mass channel sales mass channel sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
the increase was driven by increased sales of million  or  of our child of mine brand to wal mart and increased sales of million  or  of our just one year brand to target 
the increase in sales resulted primarily from selling products at more wal mart and target stores  additional floor space at both wal mart and target  and million from new product introductions 
carter s brand retail stores carter s brand retail store sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
such growth was driven by incremental sales of million generated by new store openings and a comparable store sales increase of million  or  based on locations 
this growth was partially offset by the impact of four store closures of million 
the company s comparable store sales calculations include sales for all stores that were open during the comparable fiscal period  including remodeled stores and certain relocated stores 
if a store relocates within the same center with no business interruption or material change in square footage  the sales for such store will continue to be included in the comparable store calculation 
if a store relocates to another center or there is a material change in square footage  such store is treated as a new store 
stores  which are closed  are included in the comparable store sales calculation up to the date of closing 
the increase in comparable store sales was led by a comparable store sales increase of in our brand stores 
our brand stores are generally located in high traffic strip centers located in or near major cities 
as of december   we had brand stores as compared to stores as of january  our drive to outlet stores  of which there were as of december   had a comparable store sales increase of and were impacted by rising fuel prices as these locations are generally located within to minutes outside of densely populated areas 
across the chain  comparable store sales have been driven by converting all stores to our new format beginning may of  including moving baby products to the front of the store  more impactful window displays  and more effective in store merchandising and marketing 
all stores were converted to the new store format as of april there were a total of carter s brand retail stores as of december  during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores

partially offsetting these decreases were i a reduction in product costs resulting from leveraging our full package sourcing network and completing the transition of carter s brand products to full package sourcing  ii significant growth in our higher margin retail business  resulting from the acquisition of the oshkosh brand retail stores consolidated retail sales increased from of total sales to of total sales  and iii a decrease of million in charges related to excess inventory

accordingly  the company s gross margin may not be comparable to other companies that include such distribution costs in their cost of goods sold

as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to as compared to in fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was led primarily by i the impact of a higher retail store cost structure at oshkosh as retail store selling  general  and administrative expenses  which comprise approximately of consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses  grew from of retail sales in fiscal to of retail sales in fiscal  and ii amortization of oshkosh intangible assets including a charge of million related to the oshkosh licensing agreements and leasehold interests capitalized in connection with the acquisition 
partially offsetting these increases were i a decline in distribution costs as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal  driven primarily by efficiencies gained with our distribution center in stockbridge  georgia  ii effectively managing growth in spending to a rate lower than the growth in net sales  most notably in the mass channel  and iii cessation of amortization of our carter s licensing agreements  which were fully amortized on august  amortization expense in fiscal related to these agreements was approximately million

fiscal year ended january  compared with fiscal year ended january  net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal revenue growth in all channels has been driven by the success of our focus on high quality essential core products

the decrease in revenue per dozen was driven by product mix in all product categories 
mass channel sales increased million in fiscal  or  to million 
this increase was driven by increased sales of million of our child of mine brand to wal mart and increased sales of million  or  of our just one year brand to target 
the growth in child of mine sales of million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal reflects a full year of sales as we began shipping our child of mine brand to wal mart in june of also contributing to growth in the mass channel was new door growth and additional floor space at both wal mart and target stores

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate 
net income our fiscal net income increased to million as compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service 
historically  we have financed these needs through operating cash flow and funds borrowed under our former senior credit facility 
our primary source of liquidity will be cash flow from operations and borrowings under our new revolver  and we expect that these sources will fund our ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures 
these sources of liquidity may be impacted by continued demand for our products and our ability to meet debt covenants under our new senior credit facility  described below 
net accounts receivable at december  were million compared to million at january  this increase primarily reflects million of oshkosh receivables and higher levels of wholesale and mass channel revenue in the latter part of fiscal as compared to the latter part of fiscal inventory levels at december  were million compared to million at january  increased inventory levels as of december  include million of oshkosh brand inventory and an increase in carter s brand inventory of million due primarily to increases in forecasted demand

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal and fiscal was million and million 
this increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by the growth in earnings  adjusted for non cash charges related to the transaction  increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities  and reductions in oshkosh brand inventory since the date of acquisition 
net cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was approximately million 
the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by the growth in earnings and reductions in prepaid expenses  partially offset by increased levels of inventory to support demand and increased levels of accounts receivable resulting from growth in revenue and the timing of shipments

 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
other costs paid prior and subsequent to the closing of the transaction totaled million  including million in debt issuance costs 
the term of the revolver expires july  and the term of the term loan b expires july  amounts outstanding under the revolver initially accrue interest at a prime rate plus or  at our option  a libor rate plus and may be reduced based upon the achievement of certain leverage ratios 
amounts outstanding under the term loan b accrue interest at a prime rate plus or  at our option  a libor rate plus and may be reduced based upon the achievement of certain leverage ratios and credit ratings 
interest is payable at the end of interest rate reset periods  which vary in length but in no case exceed months for libor rate loans and quarterly for prime rate loans 
the effective interest rate on variable rate term loan b borrowings as of december  was 
the senior credit facility contains financial covenants  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio  and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility also sets forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions  including an annual excess cash flow requirement  as defined  that may result in our use of cash to reduce our debt obligations 
there is no excess cash flow payment required in fiscal our obligations under the senior credit facility are collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including the assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility requires us to hedge at least of our variable rate debt under the term loan 
on september   we entered into a swap agreement to receive floating rate interest and pay fixed interest 
this swap agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest payments on a portion of our variable rate term loan b debt 
the swap agreement matures july  principal borrowings under the term loan b are due and payable in quarterly installments of million from march  through june  with the remaining balance of million due on july  in addition to scheduled amortization payments made during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we prepaid an additional million of term loan b indebtedness 
our former senior credit facility  as amended  set forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions that resulted in our use of cash to reduce our debt obligations 
accordingly  we made an excess cash flow principal prepayment of approximately million on march  no such prepayment was required in fiscal on june  march  december  and march  we prepaid an additional million  million  million  and million  respectively  of term loan indebtedness under our former senior credit facility 
at december   we had approximately million in term loan borrowings and no borrowings under our revolver  exclusive of approximately million of outstanding letters of credit

the following table summarizes as of december   the maturity or expiration dates of mandatory contractual obligations and commitments for the following fiscal years dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt interest on debt variable rate a operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements total financial obligations letters of credit purchase obligations b total financial obligations and commitments a reflects estimated variable rate interest on obligations outstanding on our term loan as of december  using an interest rate of rate in effect at december  
b unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory purchases 
amounts reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable or other current liabilities are excluded from the table above 
in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments in the table above  we have post retirement benefit obligations  included in other current and other long term liabilities  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under our new revolver  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal amount of amounts outstanding under our revolver on or before july  and amounts outstanding under our term loan b on or before july  effects of inflation and deflation we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices 
while we have been successful in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs with the expansion of our global sourcing network  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions from our global suppliers  our profitability may be affected 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with generally lower sales and gross profit in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
excluding the impact of the acquisition  over the past five fiscal years  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
with a full year of oshkosh net sales in fiscal  we expect this trend to continue 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each fiscal year 
during these peak periods  we had historically borrowed under our former revolving credit facility 
we had no borrowings under our former revolving credit facility or new revolver during fiscal as compared to peak borrowings of million in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and mass channel revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  and when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the product has been shipped and when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale and mass channel customers 
we provide accommodations and allowances to our key wholesale and mass channel customers in order to assist these customers with inventory clearance and promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon historical trends and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we contract with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of cooperative co op advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale and mass channel customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller eitf  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
goodwill and tradename as of december   we had approximately million in goodwill and tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated at the acquisition to be approximately million using a discounted cash flow analysis  which examined the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the fair value of our oshkosh tradename was estimated as of the date of the acquisition to be approximately million  also using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows  which incorporated both historical and projected financial performance  were discounted using a discount rate of ten and twelve percent for carter s and oshkosh  respectively 
the tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the carrying value of these assets is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our products and the development of new products 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances 
our impairment review of goodwill is based on the estimated fair values of the underlying businesses 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of the future cash flows of the businesses 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation arrangements we account for stock based compensation on stock options under the intrinsic value method  whereby we record compensation expense equal to the difference between the exercise price of the stock option and the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of the option grant 
for disclosure purposes only  we also estimate the impact on our net income of applying the fair value method of measuring compensation cost on stock options with the fair value  prior to our initial public offering  determined under the minimum value method as provided by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering have been valued using the black scholes option pricing model 
for stock issued or sold outright to employees  directors  or third parties  we measure expense as the difference between the price paid by the recipient  if any  and the fair market value of the stock on the date of issuance or sale 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we have selected the modified prospective method of adoption which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock based compensation awards  as they vest  beginning with the first quarter of adoption of sfas r and for all subsequent stock based compensation awards granted thereafter 
we will continue to use the black scholes method to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
sfas r is effective for public companies for annual periods that begin after june  the impact of adoption beginning january   is estimated to result in a reduction in fiscal net income of approximately million  or per diluted share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in the far east and south and central america 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from approximately vendors worldwide  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the senior credit facility requires us to hedge at least of our variable rate debt under the term loan 
on september   we entered into a swap agreement to receive floating rate interest and pay fixed interest 
this swap agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest payments on a portion of our variable rate term loan b debt 
the swap agreement matures july  the unrealized gain  net of taxes  related to the interest rate swap was million for the fiscal year ended december  and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our new senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
at december   our outstanding debt aggregated approximately million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate 
an increase of in the applicable rate would increase our annual interest cost by million  exclusive of variable rate debt subject to our swap agreement described above  and could have an adverse effect on our net income and cash flow 
other risks there also are other risks in the operation of our business specifically related to our global sourcing network 
we source substantially all of our production from third party manufacturers located in foreign countries 
as a result  we may be adversely affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries  the imposition of new regulations relating to imports  duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  including the china safeguards  any significant decreases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
these and other factors could result in the interruption of production  delay receipt of the products into the united states  or affect our sales and profitability 
our future performance may be subject to such factors  which are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we carefully select our sourcing agents  and in an effort to mitigate the possible disruption in product flow  we place production in various countries we believe to be of lower risk 
we enter into various purchase order commitments with our suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
historically  such cancellations and related termination charges have occurred infrequently and have not had a material impact on our business 
however  as we expand the use of this global sourcing network  we may incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold
