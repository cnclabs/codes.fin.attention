item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television  radio and outdoor advertising assets  reaching approximately of all hispanics in the united states 
we operate in three reportable segments television broadcasting  radio broadcasting and outdoor advertising 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment consists of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
the comparability of our results between and is significantly affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and when outdoor advertising services are provided 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting and outdoor advertising industries and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  leasing and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
highlights despite continuing competition for advertising revenue among broadcasters and between the broadcast industry and other media  we experienced growth for the year ended december   and net revenue of million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for  revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for and revenue generated by our outdoor segment accounted for 
our television segment led our success again in  generating million in net revenue as we continued to sustain solid ratings across our station group 
our television results were driven by continued growth in our top advertising categories  including automotive  services  retail services and fast food restaurants 
we continue to enjoy significant revenue growth from our television stations located in markets with rapidly growing hispanic populations  such as hartford  tampa  orlando  denver  and washington  dc  each of which experienced greater than net revenue growth in 
table of contents in addition  in june  certain of our mexican affiliates acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of the television licensee of xhrio tv in matamoros  tamaulipas  mexico  serving the mcallen  texas market  as well as substantially all of the assets related to such station  and we provide the programming and related services to the station under a time brokerage arrangement 
in august  xhrio tv was launched as a fox affiliate  which we expect to complement our existing media properties  including our univision and telefutura affiliates  and to further expand our reach among key young adult demographic groups in that market 
our radio segment also had a solid  contributing million in net revenue and experiencing growth in local and national sales significantly higher than that of the general radio industry 
we continue to focus on local sales efforts  which accounted for of total sales in during we created a third network format  jos toca lo que quiere plays what he wants  which features a mix of spanish language adult contemporary and mexican regional hits from the s through the present 
we believe that broadcasting our network programming provides us with opportunities to increase sales by providing our stations with well programmed formats with a track record of success  and we have increased the number of stations broadcasting one of our three network formats to stations in markets 
during we successfully switched to our super estrella format on six stations in five markets and our jos toca lo que quiere plays what he wants format on seven stations in seven markets 
in addition  we continued our strategy of divesting assets in markets where we did not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out full clusters 
for example  in we disposed of non core radio assets in chicago and fresno and in january we disposed of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market 
the sale of these properties allows us to redeploy capital to markets with greater growth and earning potential and has allowed us to repurchase shares of our class u common stock 
in october  we acquired an fm radio station in the sacramento  california market  which increased our cluster to four stations in this important us hispanic market 
in february  we acquired radio station kaiq fm in the lubbock  texas market  giving us one fm and one am radio station in the lubbock market in addition to our univision affiliate 
our outdoor segment provided million of our net revenue in  and benefited from strong overall demand for outdoor advertising in new york and los angeles 
in addition  increased local sales played a key role in the growth of our outdoor advertising operations in we have made a concerted effort to strengthen the staffing and training of our local sales force  and we anticipate that this focus will continue in we also continue to grow our transit advertising operations  and in april we entered into a three year agreement with the city of sacramento to sell advertising on municipal buses 
we believe that expanding our transit advertising creates opportunities to provide broader advertising coverage for national advertisers 
we also took several key steps in toward strengthening our balance sheet and improving our capital structure 
in september  we refinanced our former million syndicated bank credit facility and completed a tender offer for our million senior subordinated notes with the proceeds from a new million senior secured syndicated bank credit facility 
in addition  in january  we acquired approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision in exchange for the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market 
in march  we repurchased million shares of our class u common stock held by univision for million 
acquisitions and dispositions in february  we acquired the assets of television stations kvtf ca and ktfv ca in the mcallen  texas market and the assets of television station ketf ca in the laredo  texas market  for an aggregate of approximately million 
also in february  we acquired the assets of radio station kaiq fm in the lubbock  texas market for approximately million

in august  xhrio tv was launched as a fox affiliate in that market 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes from each of our completed acquisitions and determined that the items excluded were significant and that each of these acquisitions was not considered a business 
in addition  in january  we sold the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market  to univision for million 
univision paid the full amount of the purchase price in the form of approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision

univision paid the full amount of the purchase price in the form of approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision 
subsequently  in march  we repurchased million shares of our class u common stock held by univision 
univision is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of our operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on the following in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio outdoor consolidated direct operating expenses television radio outdoor consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio outdoor consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio outdoor consolidated segment operating profit loss television radio outdoor consolidated corporate expenses loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation operating income broadcast cash flow television radio outdoor consolidated ebitda as adjusted capital expenditures television radio outdoor consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets held for sale radio consolidated footnotes on next page 
table of contents footnotes from preceding page percentage not meaningful 
broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation and gain loss on sale of assets 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our syndicated bank credit facility  where ebitda as adjusted is referred to as consolidated adjusted ebitda 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
the actual ratios of net indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda were as follows in each case as of december  to   to   to we entered into our new syndicated bank credit facility in september so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 

table of contents broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted are non gaap measures 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to each of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted is net income loss 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to net income loss for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands broadcast cash flow corporate expenses ebitda as adjusted loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense interest income loss on debt extinguishment income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense income loss before equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates income loss before discontinued operations gain on disposal of discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated operations net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million

the remaining million of the overall increase came from our outdoor segment and was primarily attributable to an increase in both local and national advertising rates  as well as revenue associated with the expansion of our outdoor division in sacramento

we expect that this increased demand will  in turn  allow us to continue to increase our rates  resulting in continued increases in net revenue in future periods 
direct operating expenses

as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased because selling  general and administrative expenses increases were outpaced by increases in net revenue 
on a long term basis  although we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods  we expect that net revenue increases will outpace any selling  general and administrative expense increases such that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue will continue to decrease in future periods 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to not having expenses related to financing the repurchase of our series a preferred stock that we incurred in the decrease was partially offset by increased expenses in the current year  primarily attributable to higher wages and expenses associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including internal controls 
as a percentage of net revenue  corporate expenses remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and we currently anticipate that corporate expenses will increase in future periods  primarily due to recording non cash stock based compensation in corporate expense in to comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

during  we refinanced our former million syndicated bank credit facility and completed a tender offer for our million senior subordinated notes with the proceeds from a new million senior secured syndicated bank credit facility 
in january  we acquired approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision in exchange for the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market 
in march  we repurchased million shares of our class u common stock held by univision for million using cash generated from operations and unrestricted proceeds which were remaining from our refinanced syndicated bank credit facility 
syndicated bank credit facility in september  we refinanced our former syndicated bank credit facility with a new million senior secured syndicated bank credit facility consisting of a year million term loan and a year million revolving facility 
the term loan under the new syndicated bank credit facility has been drawn in full  the proceeds of which were used i to refinance million outstanding under our former syndicated bank credit facility  ii to complete a tender offer for our previously outstanding million senior subordinated notes  and iii for general corporate purposes 
the term loan matures in and is subject to automatic quarterly reductions of million starting on january  the revolving facility expires in our ability to make additional borrowings under the syndicated bank credit facility is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants  including financial ratios  and other conditions set forth in the syndicated bank credit facility 
our syndicated bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  as well as the pledge of the stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries  including our special purpose subsidiary formed to hold our fcc licenses 
the term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  in september  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october  these interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes the margin of 
we expect that as the notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements decline  our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of our interest rate swap agreements 
the excess loan amount outstanding over the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements will incur interest at libor plus 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in 
table of contents earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was million and is classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
the revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
in addition  we pay a quarterly unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the level of facility usage 
as of december   million was outstanding under our syndicated bank credit facility and million was available under the revolving facility for future borrowings 
we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit as of that date  which reduced the amount otherwise available for future borrowings 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we might be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of loans upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains a mandatory prepayment clause  triggered in the event that the proceeds of certain asset dispositions are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within months of such disposition  insurance or condemnation proceeds are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within days  or the proceeds from capital contributions or equity offerings are not utilized to acquire businesses or properties relating to radio  television and outdoor advertising within days 
in addition  if we incur certain additional indebtedness  then of such proceeds must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance  and if we have excess cash flow  as defined in our syndicated bank credit facility  in any year starting in  then of such excess cash flow must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants become increasingly restrictive in the later years of the syndicated bank credit facility 
our syndicated bank credit facility also requires us to maintain our fcc licenses for our broadcast properties and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  the making of acquisitions and the sale of assets over a certain limit 
additionally  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements because our leverage exceeded certain limits 
we can draw on our revolving facility without prior approval for working capital needs and for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration of million or less 
proposed acquisitions are conditioned upon our delivery to the agent bank of a covenant compliance certificate showing pro forma calculations assuming such acquisition had been consummated and revised revenue projections for the acquired properties 
for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration in excess of million  consent is required from lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility 
debt and equity financing on may   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register up to million of equity and debt securities  which we may offer from time to time 
that shelf registration statement has been declared effective by the sec 
we have not yet issued any securities under the shelf registration statement 
we intend to use the proceeds of any issuance of securities under the shelf registration statement to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures  to reduce or refinance debt or other obligations  and for general corporate purposes 
we have also entered into an agreement with univision under which we have agreed  at univision s request  to sell in an underwritten public offering up to a specified number of shares of our class a common stock 
table of contents previously registered with the sec  and concurrently with the consummation of that public offering  to repurchase the same number of shares of our class u common stock owned by univision  for an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering minus underwriting discounts and commissions 
under this agreement  univision has agreed to refrain from exercising any right to demand the registration of the sale of such common stock provided to it under an investor rights agreement  as amended  between univision  us and the other stockholders named therein until a period of time after giving notice to us of its request to consummate a sale transaction 
in september  we completed a tender offer for our million senior subordinated notes with a portion of the proceeds of a new million senior secured syndicated bank credit facility

broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation and gain loss on sale of assets 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our syndicated bank credit facility  where ebitda as adjusted is referred to as consolidated adjusted ebitda 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda may not exceed to on a pro 
table of contents forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
the actual ratios of net indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda were as follows in each case as of december  to   to   to we entered into our new syndicated bank credit facility in september so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted are non gaap measures

during  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
in addition to our maintenance capital expenditures  we anticipate that our digital television capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 
as part of the mandated transition from analog to digital television  full service television station owners may be required to stop broadcasting analog signals and to relinquish one of their paired analog digital channels to the fcc at the end of  if the market penetration of digital television receivers reaches certain congressionally mandated levels by that time 
we currently expect that the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for all of our full service television stations  which we are required to complete by july   will be approximately million 
in addition  we are required to broadcast separate digital and analog signals throughout this transition period 
we currently anticipate that the incremental costs of broadcasting in digital and analog  including additional rent and higher electricity expense  will be approximately million in we intend to finance the conversion to digital television out of net cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 

table of contents we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other broadcast or media opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through funds generated from operations  borrowings under our syndicated bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined each of our operating segments to be a reporting unit 
upon adoption  we assigned all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and ceased amortizing goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses and long term time brokerage agreements are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

table of contents the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
in addition  each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using accelerated and straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
we have recorded a million tax benefit for net operating losses that are expected to offset future taxable income 
our net operating loss benefits will expire from to in order to realize the value of those assets  we would need to generate an aggregate of approximately million of taxable income prior to their expiration 
we currently estimate that we will recognize adequate taxable income over the next five to ten years sufficient to realize the value of these assets 
we estimate taxable income will be significant in as a result of our sale of radio assets in the san francisco san jose market 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less 
table of contents than months 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contacts directly with the advertisers is recorded at gross 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments sfas no 
requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
in september  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october  as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and as a result  the increase in fair value is classified as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
additional information for additional information on our significant accounting policies  please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that the measurement of all share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchased through an employee stock purchase plan  be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r was issued in december and will be effective for us in the first quarter of as a result of outstanding unvested options  we anticipate non cash stock based compensation of approximately million will be recorded in direct operating expense  selling  general and administrative expense and corporate expense as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r in the impact of sfas no 
r on us in and beyond will depend upon various factors  including our future compensation strategy 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in the table in note to our consolidated financial statements and in prior filings for us have been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of the expense in future periods 
the pro forma compensation cost includes the impact of accelerating the vesting of certain unvested options 
in the prior years pro forma compensation costs we recorded forfeitures when occurred while under sfas no 
r  we will be required to estimate a forfeiture rate 

table of contents sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
our television reporting unit fair value significantly exceeds its carrying value  but our impairment analysis for each of our radio and outdoor reporting units is sensitive to change as described below 
radio we engaged an independent appraiser experienced in valuing radio broadcast properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our radio reporting unit 
the appraiser combined radio properties into market clusters and used two different discounted cash flow models for their valuation 
in markets where we had mature stations with established cash flows  the model was based on our actual historical results and expected future cash flows 
in markets where stations were not mature and did not have established cash flows  the model was based on the station s projected ability to serve its market based on its signal coverage of the market 
based on the assumptions and projections included in the appraiser s analysis  the appraiser concluded that our radio reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value as of october  upon receipt of the appraisal  we interviewed representatives of the appraiser at length regarding their findings and the methodologies used in the appraisal  and concluded that their methodologies were among several acceptable methodologies for valuing radio broadcast properties and that the results suggested that no impairment should be recorded with respect to our radio reporting unit 
however  if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates or multiples used by the appraiser were to change in any future appraisal  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
outdoor we engaged an independent appraiser experienced in valuing advertising properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our outdoor reporting unit 
the appraiser relied primarily on a discounted cash flow model for its valuation and confirmed their valuation with an analysis of comparable sales 
as a result of that valuation we believed that the estimated fair value of the outdoor reporting unit was below its carrying value by million  suggesting potential impairment 
since we had an indicator of potential impairment  as required under sfas no 
we allocated the fair value of the entire outdoor reporting unit among its components  which consist primarily of fixed assets  customer list and goodwill based on the appraisal 
after allocating the estimated fair value to the components  the implied fair value of the goodwill component exceeded its carrying value  so we determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
we then evaluated the fixed assets and customer list of our outdoor reporting unit in accordance with sfas no 
 as they are classified as long lived assets 
as required under sfas no 
 we compared the outdoor reporting unit s undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of all of the reporting unit s assets 
we determined that the sum of its projected undiscounted cash flows  including the estimated value of our billboards  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets  resulting in the recovery of its value and no impairment of the long lived assets 
in the calculation of the estimated fair value of our outdoor reporting unit  we used a combination of valuation techniques that rely on various assumptions such as estimated discounted future cash flows and multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that we will significantly increase our outdoor revenues as compared with our outdoor expenses  and that our billboards will also increase in value 
if those estimates of future cash flows  discount rates or multiples were to change  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into three interest rate swap agreements covering an aggregate of million of the outstanding balance under our syndicated bank credit facility  described more fully in item a below 
we have a participation agreement with upn that grants upn a interest in the appreciation of xupn tv above million and an affiliation agreement with telemundo that grants telemundo a interest in the appreciation of xhas tv above million  plus capital expenditures and certain other adjustments  upon certain liquidity events as defined in the agreements 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries or any interests in  or relationships with  any material variable interest entities that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
except for the items discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements are recorded at fair market value and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreement 
we have converted our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at december  however  we expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if principal payments are made in accordance with their contractual terms  a increase in the variable interest rate of our syndicated bank credit facility would be expected to increase interest expense on our term loan facility by approximately million 
if the future interest yield curve decreases the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we are required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
under no circumstances do we enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had million of bank debt outstanding 
our syndicated bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in our credit agreement 
in september  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october  these interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes the margin of 
we expect that as the notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements decline  our term loan 
table of contents amounts will exceed the notional amounts of our interest rate swap agreements 
the excess loan amount outstanding over the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements will incur interest at libor plus 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was million and is classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we have converted our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at december  however  we expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if principal payments are made in accordance with their contractual terms  a increase in the variable interest rate of our syndicated bank credit facility would be expected to increase interest expense on our term loan facility by approximately million 
if the future interest yield curve decreases the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease
