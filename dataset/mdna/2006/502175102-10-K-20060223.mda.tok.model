revenues exclude interest and other income from non mortgage loan sources and the effect of the note payoff by clc and hhi as more fully described in note notes receivable 
subsequent to december   we sold four assisted living properties operated by sunwest with a total of units to an entity formed by the principals of sunwest for  we received  in proceeds after paying approximately  of state of oregon bond obligations related to one of the properties sold 
as a result of the sale  we will recognize a gain of  in our primary objectives are to sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in long term care properties and other health care related properties managed by experienced operators 
to meet these objectives  we attempt to invest in properties that provide opportunity for additional value and current returns to our stockholders and diversify our investment portfolio by geographic location  operator and form of investment 
substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable 
our investments in mortgage loans and owned properties represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon the performance of the operators on their lease and loan obligations and the rates earned thereon 
to the extent that the operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us  there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
to mitigate this risk  we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator 
our monitoring process includes review of financial statements for each facility  periodic review of operator credit  scheduled property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to real estate taxes and insurance 
in addition to our monitoring and research efforts  we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk 
we typically invest in or finance up to percent of the stabilized appraised value of a property 
operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and or letters of credit 
in addition  operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross defaulted and cross collateralized with other loans  operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates 
for the twelve months ended december   rental income and interest income represented and  respectively  of total gross revenues excluding the effect of the note payoff by clc and hhi as more fully described in note notes receivable 
our lease structure contains fixed annual rental escalations  which are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the minimum lease period 
we also utilize lease structures that contain annual rental escalations that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property 
this revenue is not recognized until the appropriate contingencies have been resolved 
this lease structure initially generates lower revenues and net income but enables us to generate additional growth and minimized non cash straight line rent over time 
depending upon the availability and cost of external capital  we anticipate making additional investments in health care related properties 
new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and internally generated cash flows 
our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on mortgage loans receivable 
permanent financing for future investments  which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured line of credit  is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of secured debt 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations  meet debt service obligations both principal and interest  make dividend distributions and finance future investments 
key transactions during we purchased three skilled nursing properties in new mexico as discussed in note real estate investments 
in addition  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered direct placement as discussed in note stockholders equity

we received million in proceeds after paying million of state of oregon bond obligations related to one of the properties sold 
as a result of the sale  we will recognize a gain of million in key performance indicators  trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business 
these indicators are discussed below and relate to concentration risk and credit strength 
management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results  in making operating decisions and for business planning purposes 
concentration risk 
we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix  investment mix  operator mix and geographic mix 
concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns 
asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property 
in order to qualify as an equity reit  at least percent of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets  cash  cash items and government securities 
investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types 
operator mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top four operators 
geographic mix measures the portion of our investment that relate to our top five states 
the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk period ended gross investment  in thousands asset mix real property      loans receivable     remic certificates    investment mix assisted living properties     skilled nursing properties     school      remic certificates    operator mix alterra      center healthcare  inc     ehsi      sunwest      remaining operators     geographic mix california      colorado      florida      iowa      ohio      texas      remaining states     subsequent to december   we sold four assisted living properties operated by sunwest with a total of units to an entity formed by the principals of sunwest for million 
we received million in proceeds after paying million of state of oregon bond obligations related to one of the properties sold 
as a result of the sale  we will recognize a gain of million in tied for fifth most concentrated state calculated by number of facilities in each state 
credit strength 
we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios 
our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization and debt to market capitalization 
the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long term debt 
our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends 
the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors  analysts and rating agencies in the valuation  comparison  rating and investment recommendations of companies 
the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures three months ended debt to book capitalization ratio debt to market capitalization ratio interest coverage ratio x x x x x fixed charge coverage ratio x x x x x excluding the effects of the clc and hhi note payoff as more fully described in note notes receivable 
if the effects of the clc and hhi note payoff were included  the interest coverage ratio would be x and the fixed charge coverage ratio would be x 
we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results 
our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations 
this may be a result of various factors  including  but not limited to the status of the economy  the status of capital markets  including prevailing interest rates  compliance with and changes to regulations and payment policies within the health care industry  changes in financing terms  competition within the health care and senior housing industries  and changes in federal  state and local legislation 
management regularly monitors the economic and other factors listed above 
we develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position 
our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company specific trends
