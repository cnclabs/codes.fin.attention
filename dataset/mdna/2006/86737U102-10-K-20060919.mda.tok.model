corporate business strategy since  our business strategy has focused on the acquisition and operation of community hospitals in the united states 
on february   sunlink purchased five community hospitals  leasehold rights for a sixth existing hospital and the related businesses of all six hospitals for approximately  in october  we acquired two additional hospitals through our acquisition of healthmont  inc in june  we sold our mountainside medical center  a bed hospital located in jasper  ga for approximately  through our subsidiaries  we currently operate a total of seven community hospitals in four states 
currently six of the hospitals are owned and one is leased 
our primary operational strategy is to improve the profitability of our hospitals by reducing out migration of patients  recruiting physicians  expanding services and implementing and maintaining effective cost controls 
our efforts are focused on internal growth 
however  we actively seek to supplement internal growth through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is to selectively acquire community hospitals with net revenues of approximately  or more which are the sole or primary hospital in market areas with a population of greater than  or a principal healthcare provider with substantial market share in communities with a population of  to  we believe all of our seven existing hospitals meet at least one of these two market area criteria 
the company considers recent prices paid by others for certain hospital acquisitions to be higher than we would seek to pay but believes there may be opportunities for acquisitions of hospitals in the future due to  among other things  negative trends in certain government reimbursement programs and other factors 
from time to time we may consider hospitals for disposition if we determine their operating results or potential growth no longer meet our strategic objectives 
sunlink announced in december that its board of directors had retained a financial advisor for the purpose of evaluating the company s strategic alternatives  which alternatives could include a sale of the company or a merger  acquisition or other transaction 
sunlink s evaluation of such alternatives is currently ongoing 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings or financial condition 
the table of critical accounting estimates that follow is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands receivable net and provision for bad debts receivables net primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors and patients from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets as of june was as follows   and our provision for bad debts  included in our results of operations  was as follows  and the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we attempt to verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled non emergency admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the estimated amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and non emergency urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
in general  we utilize the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  sue to collect if the patient has the means to pay and chooses not to pay and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off the accounts our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is typically no longer than days after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improved if net revenues during fiscal were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by  among other things  changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in federal or state governmental healthcare coverage 
a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and potentially our future access to capital 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands receivables net and provisions for bad debts continued performance the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a quarter by quarter basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
receivables net at june  by payor class and aging was as follows in addition  we analyze other factors such as days revenue in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
days outstanding payor class total medicare commercial medicaid self pay total the above table shows net patient accounts receivable aged from patient billing date and are grouped by classification of verified insurance coverage 
the receivables are net of contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts are calculated by payor class and are not calculated by the aging of the patient billing date  therefore  these allowances have been allocated within the aging of the various payor classes based upon gross patient receivable amounts 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands revenue recognition net patient service revenues continued we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
patient receivables primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors  such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are determined pursuant to contracts or established government rates and are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and patient receivables are reduced to net amounts receivable pursuant to such contracts or government payment rates through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately of our revenues during relate to discounted charges 
the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues medicare  medicaid  and commercial insurance revenues are recorded at estimated amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided net of contractual discounts pursuant to contract or government payment rates 
prior to full implementation of our new patient account system  we utilize multiple patient accounting systems 
therefore  estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved and the patient accounting system used by each of our hospitals 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are estimated manually using historical collections for each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience on a periodic basis 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials 
governmental payors governmental payors the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in periods before  are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
adjustments related to final settlements for revenues retrospectively increased our revenues by the following amounts  and balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands revenue recognition net patient service revenues continued commercial insurance commercial insurance for most managed care plans  contractual allowances estimated at the time of service are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our commercial revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
goodwill and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets including separately identified intangible assets of acquired companies 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows  and the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of healthmont  inc please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we follow the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of june of each year 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the purchase price of acquisitions is we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of june  and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future

we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are derived from independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims as part of providing healthcare services 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for the period february  to february   the self insured retention amount was per individual claim 
for the period february  to february   our self insured retention level was  on individual malpractice claims 
for the period march  to february   our self insured retention level was on individual malpractice claims 
for the period march  to february   our self insured retention level is on individual malpractice claims 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with the reserve for professional and general liability claims are based upon independent actuarial calculations  which consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
we revise our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations twice each year 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses recorded during a reporting period 
in determining loss estimates  professional judgment is used by each actuary by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used by our independent actuary with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands professional and general liability claims continued respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have increased in recent years  we have accepted a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june was as follows  and the total expense for professional and general liability coverage  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states  including georgia  have passed varying forms of tort reform which may attempt to limit the number and types of claims and the amount of some medical malpractice awards 
if enacted limitations remain in place or if similar laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
conversely  liberalization of the number and type of claims and damage awards permitted under any such law applicable to our operations could cause our loss estimates to increase 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact currently on our liquidity or capital resources

we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our net deferred tax asset balances net of valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years were as follows  and our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years were as follows  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in the first step of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management s judgment regarding such likelihood 
we compute the tax on each contingency 
we then determine the amount of loss  or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflect such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period 
our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by  as of june   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
we generated federal taxable income in fiscal years  and therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets is remote 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur approximately of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands accounting for income taxes continued when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
financial summary the results of continuing operations shown in the historical summary below are for our us community hospital operations  which is composed of five facilities acquired february  shl facilities and two healthmont facilities acquired october  healthmont facilities 
years ended june  net revenues cost of patient service revenues operating profit interest expense interest income loss on early repayment of debt earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes admissions equivalent admissions surgeries revenue per equivalent admission equivalent admissions equivalent admissions is used by management and certain investors as a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
the equivalent admissions computation is intended to relate outpatient revenues to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume to result in a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume equivalent admissions 
results of operations all of our net revenues are from our us community hospital segment 
the operations of sunlink s former mountainside medical center which was operated during these periods is reported in discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to an increase in commercial insurance net revenues which increased in the current year and an increase in revenue per equivalent admission resulting in price increases for most services at our hospitals 
net outpatient service revenues increased  a increase from last year to  and increased to of net revenues from last year 
net revenues for the years ended june  and included  and  respectively  from state indigent care programs 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions and a increase in surgeries 
net outpatient service revenues increased  a increase from last year to  and increased to of net revenues from last year 
the increase in net outpatient service revenues resulted from an increase in outpatient surgeries in the year ended june  compared to the prior year and one hospital which increased its outpatient net revenues by of its net revenues during the current year due to increased laboratory procedures 
recruitment of new doctors and spending for capital improvements have contributed greatly to the increase in net revenues in the years ended june   and  respectively 
we added net new doctors during the year ended june   six net new doctors during the year ended june  and net new doctors during the year ended june  not including the doctors added in the healthmont acquisition 
during the year ended june   sunlink spent  on physician guarantees and recruiting expenses compared to  last year 
we also have expended approximately  for capital expenditures to upgrade services and facilities since july  we believe the upgraded services and facilities and the new doctors contributed to the increase in net revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
we continue to seek increased patient volume by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  further upgrading the services offered by the hospitals and improving the hospitals physical facilities 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient revenues from various payors in the company s hospitals for the periods indicated years ended june  source medicare medicaid self pay commercial insurance other during the fiscal year ended june   we experienced a decrease in medicare and medicaid as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in commercial insurance and other revenues 
the changes were due primarily to increased managed care patients and out patient revenues 
medicare net revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june  but decreased as a percentage of total net revenues 
during the fiscal year ended june   we experienced a decrease in medicare as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in medicaid and commercial insurance and other revenues 
in each case  the changes were due primarily due to increased managed care patients and increased out patient revenues 
the level of our self pay net revenues as a percent of net revenues was unchanged in fiscal from fiscal cost of patient services revenues  including depreciation  were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively

no share option compensation expense was recorded in the year ended june  provision for bad debts increased as a percentage of net revenue in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to increases in charges for services rendered that could not be collected  overall decreased collections as a percentage of net revenues and higher self pay net revenues during the year 
self pay net revenues increased  or in the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
supplies expense decreased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to decreased admissions and surgeries 
other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to decreased insurance and physician recruiting expense 
the decrease in insurance expense resulted from lower insurance costs and lower actuarially determined liability for professional risks 
purchased services increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to increased usage of outside services such as radiology  nuclear medicine and mri 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   primarily due to higher contract labor 
contract labor increased due to higher utilization of contract nursing services 
provision for bad debt expense decreased as a percent of net revenue in the year ended june  due to improved up front collections and increased commercial insurance net revenues 
other operating expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   although insurance expense increased by approximately  from the prior year due to higher premium costs and self insured reserves 
physician recruiting expense included in other operating expenses decreased in the year ended june  from the prior year due to fewer physicians receiving guarantees during the year 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended june   and   respectively 
the slight increase in fiscal interest expense resulted from higher interest rates on floating rate debt 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to decreased debt of approximately  during the year ended june   resulting primarily from the use of proceeds from the sale of mountainside in june in october  we repaid  from proceeds of a new  credit facility  mortgages totaling  due august  a term note with a principal amount of  due august and a revolving loan with  outstanding 
the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of this loss is composed of of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments and a penalty related to the early repayment of the revolving loan 
in june  we repaid a senior subordinated note principal amount of  due january  a term note principal amount of  due march  a term loan principal amount of  due june and a  revolving credit facility  outstanding which had an expiration date of december  the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of  the loss is composed of  of unamortized discount on the senior subordinated note  of penalty related to the early repayment of the term loan and of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments 
we recorded income tax expense of   federal and state tax expense for the year ended june  compared to income tax expense of   federal and state tax expense for the year ended june  and an income tax benefit of federal benefit and state tax for the year ended june  the  federal tax expense for the year ended june  included a deferred tax benefit 
the federal tax expense for the year ended june  included of deferred income tax expense 
the federal benefit for the year ended june  resulted from adjusting our domestic deferred asset valuation allowance to reflect expected future tax benefits from the deferred tax asset that are more likely than not to be utilized in future periods 
we had an estimated net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at june  use of this net operating loss carry forward is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue code section as a result  not all of the net operating loss carry forward is available to offset federal taxable income in the current year 
we have provided a valuation allowance for  of our  gross deferred tax asset the majority of which is the net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes as it is our assessment based upon the criteria identified in sfas no 
that it is currently more likely than not that only  of the gross deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
earning from continuing operations were  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to earnings from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and a loss from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  earning from continuing operations in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal due to lower net operating tax loss carry forwards available in fiscal earnings from continuing operations in fiscal resulted from increased operating profit and lower interest expense as compared to fiscal the loss in fiscal resulted primarily from the loss on the early repayment of debt of  and the increased interest expense which resulted from the increased debt assumed or undertaken in connection with the healthmont acquisition 
loss from discontinued operations of resulted from of losses after tax benefit from mountainside  primarily due to of unfavorable settlements of prior years medicaid cost reports relating to periods prior to sunlink s sale of mountainside  reduced by of earnings of domestic pension items 
earnings from discontinued operations of for the year ended june  included of earnings after tax of mountainside after its disposition  primarily due to collection of receivables in excess of allowances at the end of the prior fiscal year  reduced by of domestic pension items and of income tax expense related to the pension items 
earnings from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  included  of after tax gain on the sale of mountainside medical center  reduced by  of pre tax loss from operations of mountainside prior to its disposition  of domestic pension items and of income tax expense 
net earnings for the year ended june  were  per fully diluted share compared to net earnings of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and net earnings of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda represent the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization 
we understand that certain industry analysts and investors generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the liquidity of a company  and it is presented to assist analysts and investors in analyzing the ability of a company to generate cash  service debt and meet capital requirements 
we believe increased ebitda is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations

on october  sunlink entered into a  five year senior secured credit facility comprised of a revolving line of credit of up to  with an interest rate at libor plus  a  term loan with an interest rate at libor plus and a  term loan with an interest rate at libor plus the sunlink credit facility 
only the  term loan has been drawn  of which  was outstanding at june  the proceeds were used to repay  of healthmont debt which was payable on august  sunlink is using the remaining funds from the initial draw and expects to use the funds available from the revolving line of credit for hospital capital projects  equipment purchases and working capital needs 
the  term loan and draws under the  term loan are repayable pursuant to a year term amortization from the date of draw with final balloon payments due at the end of the five year maturity of the sunlink credit facility 
the total availability of credit under all components of the credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings which would have provided for current total borrowing capacity at june  of approximately  we began using the revolving line of credit during july the borrowing under the  term loan may be used  subject to satisfaction of certain covenants  to satisfy a portion of certain obligations with respect to discontinued operations  to fund acquisitions or a portion thereof or to reacquire certain company securities 
the sunlink credit facility is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all assets and properties  real and personal  of the company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries  including a pledge of all of the equity interests in such subsidiaries 
for the year ended june   the company was in violation of an annual capital expenditure covenant of the credit facility 
a waiver of the violation of this covenant has been received from the lender 
if sunlink or its applicable subsidiaries experience a material adverse change in their business  assets  financial condition  management or operations  or if the value of the collateral securing the sunlink credit facility decreases  we may be unable to draw on the credit facility 
we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from continuing operations and availability under the sunlink credit facility 
the total availability of credit under all components of the sunlink credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings  which  based upon the company s estimates  would provide for current borrowing capacity of approximately  at june   of which  was outstanding under a term loan 
the current remaining availability of approximately  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the risk  uncertainties and other factors listed at the beginning of item  as well as lower earnings due to lower demand for our services by patients  changes in patient mix and changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services

each month the physician s gross patient receipts are accumulated and the difference between the monthly guarantee and the physician s actual gross receipts for the month is calculated 
if the guarantee is greater than the receipts  the difference is accrued as a liability and an expense 
the net guarantee amount is paid to the physician in the succeeding month 
if the physician s monthly receipts exceed the guarantee amount in subsequent months  then the overage is repaid to sunlink to the extent of any prior monthly guarantee payments and the liability and expense is reduced by the amount of the repayments 
sunlink expensed   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  for these guarantees 
at june   we had outstanding long term debt of  of which  was incurred in connection with the sunlink credit facility and was related to capital leases 
by the end of  we expect to be substantially completed with the conversion of our hospitals to a single management information systems 
prior to the conversion  we previously utilized three different management information systems at our seven hospitals 
five hospitals utilize comprehensive systems designed for larger hospitals and two hospitals utilize a system designed for smaller hospitals 
in june  sunlink entered into a license and support agreement with a management information system company for a single management information system for our seven hospitals with an estimated cost of  for software  installation  training and support 
in july  sunlink entered into a capital lease for computer and other hardware for the new system with a total commitment of approximately the total cost of the software licenses  hardware  installation and training for the new management information system is estimated to be  approximately  of which is expected to be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the new system  which is years for hardware and years for the licenses and installation

discontinued operations krug international uk ltd 
krug uk  an inactive uk subsidiary of sunlink  entered into a guarantee the beldray lease guarantee  at a time when it owned beldray limited  a uk manufacturing business 
the beldray lease guarantee covers beldray s obligations under a lease for a portion of beldray s manufacturing location 
in october  krug uk received correspondence from the landlord of such facility that the rent payment of  british pounds for the fourth quarter of had not been paid by beldray and requesting payment of such amount pursuant to the beldray lease guarantee 
in january  krug uk received further correspondence from the landlord demanding two quarterly rent payments totaling  british pounds under the beldray lease guarantee 
on january   the landlord filed a petition in the high court of justice chancery division to wind up krug uk under the provisions of the insolvency act of and krug uk was placed into involuntary liquidation by the high court in february after that date  the court appointed liquidator of krug uk has made certain inquiries of sunlink regarding the activities of krug uk prior to the liquidation to which sunlink has responded 
sunlink s non current liability reserves for discontinued operations at june   included a reserve for a portion of the beldray guarantee 
such reserve was based upon management s estimate  after consultation with its property consultants and legal counsel  of the cost to satisfy the beldray guarantee in light of krug uk s limited assets and before taking into account any other claims against krug uk 
the maximum potential obligation of krug uk for rent under the beldray guarantee is estimated to be approximately  as a result of this claim and the uk liquidation proceedings against krug uk  sunlink expects krug uk to be wound up in liquidation in the uk and has fully reserved for any assets of krug uk 
additional contingent obligations  other than with respect to our existing operations  include potential product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of our discontinued industrial segment in fiscal and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual at june  related to the beldray lease guarantee  as discussed above 
we are currently in the process of liquidating two dormant subsidiaries in germany and france 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to these liquidations 
sarbanes oxley section we are currently in the process of planning for the evaluation  documentation and testing of our internal control systems in order to permit our management to be in a position to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting as of june   as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
as a consequence  we anticipate incurring substantial additional expenses in the fiscal year ending june  and subsequent fiscal years as well as diverting substantial time of the company s management and board of directors to this task 
while we currently are planning for timely completion of such documentation  testing and evaluation  there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley with adequate compliance by june  should we be unable to do so  we could be subjected to investigation by regulatory authorities  incur litigation costs and or suffer loss of our amex listing 
any such actions could adversely affect our financial results and or the market price of our common shares 
we incurred incremental costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley during the year ended june  we anticipate that these costs will increase and become significant in future periods 
specifically  the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley requirements is expected to result in increased operating expenses during the fiscal year ending june  and subsequent fiscal years 
although we do not currently have specific estimates of these costs  the cost of the initial implementation as well as on going compliance with section could be particularly high for the company due to its decentralized management structure 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

the guidance in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  its adoption by the company did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

interpretation is intended to result in a more consistent recognition of liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  b more information about expected future cash outflows associated with those obligations  and c more information about investments in long lived assets because additional asset retirement costs will be recognized as part of the carrying amounts of the assets 
interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation

the guidance in this staff position amends fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin by adding minimum revenue guarantees to the list of example contracts to which fin applies 
under fsp fin  a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
one example cited in fsp fin involves a guarantee provided by a healthcare entity to a non employed physician in order to recruit such physician to move to the entity s geographical area and establish a private practice 
in the example  the healthcare entity also agreed to make payments to the relocated physician if the gross revenue or gross receipts generated by the physician s new practice during a specified time period did not equal or exceed predetermined monetary thresholds 
fsp fin is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after january  the company adopted fsp fin effective january  sunlink s accounting policy for physician guarantees issued prior to january  was to expense guarantees as they were paid 
for physician guarantees issued on or after january   the company will expense the advances paid to physicians over the period of the physician recruiting agreement  which is typically two to three years

 accounting for servicing of financial assets 
the new standard  which is an amendment to fas no 
 will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities  such as those common with mortgage securitization activities 
specifically  the new standard addresses the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities and provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
the standard also clarifies when an obligation to service financial assets should be separately recognized as a servicing asset or a servicing liability 
requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
permits an entity with a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability to choose either of the following methods for subsequent measurement a 
amortization method b 
fair value method fas no 
permits a servicer that uses derivative financial instruments to offset risks on servicing to report both the derivative financial instrument and related servicing asset or liability by using a consistent measurement attribute fair value

in june  fasb published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

interpretation attempts to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one of the following a 
an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable b 
a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability c 
both a and b 
a company that presents a classified statement of financial position should classify a liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the enterprise anticipates making a payment within one year or the operating cycle  if longer 
an income tax liability should not be classified as a deferred tax liability unless it results from a taxable temporary difference that is  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability as calculated using this interpretation and its reported amount in the statement of financial position 
this interpretation does not change the classification requirements for deferred taxes 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
use of a valuation allowance as described in statement is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
the requirement to assess the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the sufficiency of future taxable income is unchanged by this interpretation 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  its adoption by the company should not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

the standby fee was paid in september the standby bridge loan was entered into by sunlink for short term financing requirements due to the bankruptcy in august of its revolving line of credit facility lender 
the day commitment period passed without any borrowing being made under the standby facility 
inflation during periods of inflation and labor shortages  employee wages increase and suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices for their supplies and services 
we have not always been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices for our services and products or by implementing cost control measures 
we are unable to predict our ability to control future cost increases or offset future cost increases by passing along the increased cost to customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of borrowing under the sunlink credit facility completed in october borrowings of  at june  were outstanding under the sunlink credit facility at interest rates based upon libor
