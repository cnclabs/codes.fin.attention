overview we are a leading global provider of a line of high quality  easy to use communications equipment that enables enterprise users to more effectively conduct video  voice  data and web communications 
our offerings are organized along four product lines video communications  voice communications  network systems  and services 
for reporting purposes  we aggregate video communications and voice communications into one segment named communications and report network systems and services as separate segments 
our products are unified under the polycom accelerated communications architecture  a framework of common technology principles and objectives for intelligent  standards based communications 
this architecture is designed to facilitate interoperability among systems in a multi vendor ecosystem  leverage common features across a variety of products and streamline management processes 
the polycom accelerated communications architecture serves as the enabling platform for unified collaborative communication  our corporate vision of a unified communications environment for employees  customers and partners to communicate in a dispersed workplace 
the shift from circuit switched telephony networks to internet protocol ip based networks is a significant driver for polycom s collaborative communications markets and for our business 
in  for instance  our voice over ip voip products grew faster than any other product line in the company 
in addition  over half of our group video products and essentially all of our desktop video products were shipped to connect to ip environments rather than legacy isdn networks 
strategically  polycom is investing much of its research  development  sales and marketing efforts into delivering a superior ip based collaborative communications solution  using polycom proprietary technology in the evolving  standards based ip communications environment 
in january  we sold to verilink corporation  or verilink  certain fixed assets and intellectual property rights relating to our network access product line  including our line of netengine integrated devices 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our network access product line as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas the results of operations of our network access product line that was sold to verilink have been classified as discontinued  and prior periods have been reclassified  including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining reporting segments 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our discontinued operations 
on january   we completed our acquisition of voyant technologies  inc  or voyant  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of november  voyant designs and delivers group voice communication solutions and is a part of our network systems and services segments 
voyant has been included in our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows from january   the date of acquisition 
on august   we completed our acquisition of dstmedia technology co  ltd  or dstmedia  a privately held video solutions company headquartered in beijing  china 
dstmedia designs and delivers video network systems solutions  as well as lower cost video ip solutions  and is included in our communications and network systems segments 
dstmedia has been included in our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows from august   the date of acquisition 
our consolidated revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our voice and video communications products  and to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our network systems products 
during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities  which after the impact of other investing and financing activities  resulted in a million net increase in our total cash and cash equivalents 
our communications segment includes videoconferencing collaboration products and voice communications products and accounted for of our revenues in our network systems segment includes our mgc and readivoice series of media servers  readimanager network management product  pathnavigator call processing server  and other network management and scheduling software and accounted for of revenues in our services segment includes a wide range of professional service and support offerings to our resellers and directly to some end user customers and accounted for of revenues in competition that we face in our markets is intense and competition that we face in certain of our international markets is different than that we face in north america and is currently based principally on price 
we have noted additional competitors and increased pricing pressures in china  india and other parts of asia contributing to the flat revenues that we have seen in asia in the first and second quarters of and decreased revenues in the third quarter of as compared to the respective year ago periods 
although we had improved sequential performance in asia in the fourth quarter of  revenues are lower than the comparable year ago period  and we still see increased competition in this region  particularly in china 
if we are unable to compete effectively in these regions in terms of price  technology  product offerings or marketing strategies  our overall financial results may suffer 
sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products  particularly in our third and first quarters 
there is generally a slowdown of sales in the european region in the third quarter of each year and sales to government entities typically slow in our fourth quarter and  to a greater extent  in our first quarter 
in addition  sales of our video communications products have typically declined in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business  which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters  as they did in the first quarter of the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 
the discussion of our segment operating results is presented for the three years ended december   including voyant s results of operations from january  and dstmedia s results of operations from august  results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenues unless indicated otherwise  consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated

network system revenues were impacted by a decrease in video network system volumes  as well as lower average selling prices  particularly on low end products  primarily as a result of increased competition 
services revenues increased to million for from million in  primarily due to increased video related services and video network system services  and to a lesser extent increases in audio network system services

on a regional basis  north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
north america  europe and latin america revenues increased  and  respectively  in over  while asia pacific revenues decreased 
north america revenues increased as a result of an increase in voice and video communication product revenues  and to a lesser extent  increased service revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in network systems revenues 
europe revenues increased as a result of an increase in video and voice communication product revenues  and to a lesser extent  increased service revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in network systems revenues 
latin america revenues increased as a result of increased video and voice communication product revenues  and to a lesser extent  increases in network systems and services revenues 
asia pacific revenues decreased primarily as a result of decreased video communication product revenues and network systems product revenues 
these decreases were only partially offset by increases in voice communication product revenues and increased service revenues 
on a regional basis  north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america revenues increased   and  respectively  in over north america revenues increased as a result of increased network systems and voice communication product revenues  and to a lesser extent  increased video communication product and services revenues 
the increases in network systems and services were due in part to the voyant acquisition 
europe revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in video and voice communication products  network systems and services revenues 
asia pacific revenues increased as a result of increased network systems and voice communication product revenues  and to a lesser extent  increases in video communication product revenues and services 
latin america revenues increased primarily as a result of increased video communication revenues  and to a lesser extent  due to increases in voice communication product revenues  network systems and services revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or our services segment revenues in  or in  one channel partner accounted for of our communications segment revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our communications segment revenues in or no one customer accounted for more than of our network systems segment revenues in and in  our network systems segment had two channel partners that  together  represented approximately of network systems segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any or all of these channel partners would have a long term material adverse affect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
in  we began selling our audio network systems  a product line obtained through the voyant acquisition  direct to end users and the revenues in the network systems segment from end users are subject to more variability than our revenues from our reseller customers 
the loss of one or more of the audio network system customers could have a material impact on our network systems segment and consolidated revenues 
in  we made changes to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that generally resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than as a revenue reduction as it was previously 
this change affected how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities and was intended to better leverage our collective marketing efforts 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses all increased in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change had no effect on our net income or cash flows 
in and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for those years  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order  and  therefore backlog has not been a good indicator of future revenues 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and record revenue for in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue 
we ended with a more significant amount of order backlog than our historical experience  primarily as a result of the level and timing of orders received and customer delivery dates requested outside of the quarter 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate and is dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly  deferred revenue associated with our vsx products  and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders  which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline from current levels 
cost of revenues and gross margins year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands product cost of revenues of product revenues pts pts product gross margins pts pts service cost of revenues of service revenues pts pts service gross margins pts pts total cost of revenues of total revenues pt pts total gross margin pt pts cost of product revenues and product gross margins cost of product revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  network systems segment products have a higher gross margin than our communications segment products 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to primarily as a result of decreased margins in our network systems segment 
network system margins were impacted by a decrease in video network system volumes  as well as lower average selling prices  particularly on low end products  primarily as a result of increased competition 
gross margins in our communications segment were essentially flat year over year 
additionally  in  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was previously 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses all increased in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change had no effect on our net income or cash flows 
in and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for those years  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
overall  product gross margins increased by percentage points in as compared to as a result of more favorable margins in our communications and network systems segments 
video and voice communications product margins were favorably impacted due to increased volumes and improved product mix 
network system margins were favorably impacted by an increase in video system volumes and video system upgrades  which were partially offset by a mix shift to lower margin systems and lower gross margins on audio network products 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
overall  service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on audio network systems services 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve months following shipment 
overall  service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on audio network systems services as a result of the voyant acquisition 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve months following shipment 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  litigation outcomes and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty and recall costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  with the improvement in the economy  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products  such as the cost increases for memory devices used in many of our products we experienced in further  in late we began including one year of service with some of our video products which has lowered our gross margins for those products as a result of allocating a portion of our product revenue to deferred service revenue 
however  service gross margins are favorably impacted when the deferred revenue is recorded as revenue 
in addition  most  if not all of our future products may also have one year of service included with the product  thereby potentially impacting product gross margins negatively  depending on the pricing model we establish for those products 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products could occur  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
cost of revenues will also increase in as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of  as well as  annual merit increases and incentive accruals 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pts pts sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
additionally  in january  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that resulted in the co op marketing funds generally being treated as a marketing expense rather than as a revenue reduction as it was previously 
sales and marketing expenses  except for direct marketing expenses  are not allocated to our segments 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to is primarily due to a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was in prior years 
for  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for  marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
excluding the effect of the co op marketing change  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased by for as compared to the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was due primarily to an increase in our sales headcount due to overall expansion of our sales effort  increased trade show and marketing event activities and the change to our co op marketing program discussed above 
this was partially offset by reduced spending on outside marketing services due to our consolidating these services to fewer vendors 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to is due to the increase in revenues over the year ago period 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to increased sales commissions  as a result of improved sales performance against quota  and to a lesser extent due to an increase in our sales and marketing headcount from the voyant acquisition in january additionally  marketing expenses were higher due to increased product launch and trade show activity during we believe we will incur increased expenses  especially advertising  to expand the overall market for  drive market penetration of  and increase the adoption rate of our technology and products and to educate potential end users as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts as we expand north american and international markets and increase our sales coverage in existing markets  market new products and expand the public sector 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses will increase in as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of  as well as  annual merit increases and incentive accruals 
research and development expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt pt research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for decreased slightly compared to  primarily due to increasing revenues 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars by from million in to million in the decrease in absolute research and development expense dollars was primarily due to decreased headcount related expenses and development spending in our network systems segment  which was partially offset by increases in research and development expenses in the communications segment in as compared to research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for decreased slightly compared to  primarily due to increasing revenues 
the increase in absolute research and development expense dollars to million in as compared to million in  an increase of  was primarily due to increased headcount  headcount related expenses and development spending  which was partially a result of the voyant acquisition in january increases in research and development expenses occurred for the network systems segment and  also to a lesser extent  for the communications segment in as compared to we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our unified collaboration communications solutions  which encompasses products and services in all our segments 
we anticipate committing a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward the development of our software and infrastructure products  which are included in the network systems segment  to enhance the integration and interoperability of our entire product suite 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development to develop new technologies and to combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future 
in addition  research and development expenses will increase in as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of  as well as  annual merit increases and incentive accruals 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt pt general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  patent litigation costs  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are not allocated to our segments 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the decrease in absolute dollars as well as the increase in revenues from the prior year 
the decrease in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily the result of decreased legal fees associated with litigation  partially offset by increased infrastructure costs 
in  the decrease in legal fees accounted for million of the decrease  which was partially offset by increases in infrastructure costs of million 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the increase in revenues from the prior year 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily the result of increased legal fees associated with litigation  especially the cpi litigation  annual salary increases and accrued bonuses  increased infrastructure costs and outside services  including increased audit fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improvements in our accounts receivable aging 
in  the increase in salary and related costs accounted for million of the increase  the increase in legal fees accounted for million of the increase  the increase in outside services accounted for million of the increase and infrastructure costs accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in bad debt expense 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
the acquisition of voyant did not add significantly to our general and administrative expense 
significant charges due to costs associated with litigation  including our ongoing litigation against codian  or uncollectability of our receivables would increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to visibility of costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements and our continued investments in international regions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses will increase in as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of  as well as  annual merit increases and incentive accruals 
acquisition related costs we recorded charges to operations of million in  million in and million in for acquisition related costs 
these charges primarily include outside financial advisory  accounting  legal and consulting fees and other direct merger related expenses 
the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate dstmedia  which we acquired in august the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate voyant after the acquisition in january  and to a lesser extent  additional professional service fees related to the ongoing liquidation of international picturetel legal entities 
the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate and liquidate the international picturetel and accord legal entities and to begin the integration of our acquisition of voyant which closed in january if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to these transactions 
purchased in process research and development in and  we incurred charges totaling million and million  respectively  for purchased in process research and development 
we did not incur any such charges in this research and development was acquired in as part of the dstmedia acquisition and in as part of the voyant acquisition  and was primarily related to development projects for the readivoice series innovox media servers which was completed and commenced shipping in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development were determined by management after considering  among other factors  the results of an independent appraisal based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry  and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development for dstmedia and voyant 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the in process research and development projects were discounted at rates ranging from for dstmedia and to for voyant in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technology feasibility 
at december   all significant in process research and development projects had been completed 
amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  for amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to eight years 
in  million of the million expense related to the impairment of certain intangibles we acquired in the voyant acquisition 
there were no impairment charges in or the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles related to the picturetel  circa and apsi acquisitions becoming fully amortized at december  the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily related to the voyant acquisition and the resulting million recorded for purchased intangibles  which accounted for million of the million expensed in partially offsetting this increase related to voyant were picturetel intangibles which became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarters of and  we completed our annual impairment test of purchased intangibles 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of the impairment test  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from the oci product line due to its announced discontinuance in the fourth quarter of this results in a permanent reduction in future amortization expense of approximately  in the first two quarters of   for the third and fourth quarters of   per quarter in and  per year for through our intangible assets were not impaired as of december  we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
at december   the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million 
restructure costs in  we approved a restructuring plan for eliminating or relocating certain positions throughout the company  but focused on the sales and general and administrative functions 
the resulting actions were intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  we recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  this charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to the workforce reductions which comprised less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
all obligations related to these charges were paid or released by december  this charge was partially offset by a release of a remaining reserve that was recorded in related to the restructuring of the network systems segment discussed below  resulting in net restructuring charges for the year of million 
in  we approved a restructuring plan for our network systems segment 
the resulting actions were intended to improve the overall cost structure of the network systems segment by focusing resources on strategic areas of the business  streamlining certain engineering efforts and reducing operating expenses 
in accordance with sfas  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  this charge consisted primarily of severance and other employee termination benefits related to the workforce reductions which comprised less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
all payments related to these actions have been made 
in  we approved restructuring actions primarily in connection with the sale of the network access product line to verilink and in response to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
these actions were meant to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
the charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately percent of our employees worldwide 
the restructuring charge related to the communications  services and network systems segments amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the balance of the restructuring charge related to operating activities which are separately managed at the corporate level and not allocated to segments 
all payments related to these actions have been made 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation reserves and payments in  we released less than million of the remaining reserves related to a distributor claim and a tentative settlement of an employment claim that were recorded in the second half of in  we recorded million for litigation reserves and payments of which million was related to the settlement of a patent infringement litigation matter whereby we entered into a settlement agreement with avistar communications  inc avistar and collaboration properties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of avistar cpi 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid avistar a one time amount of million  and cpi agreed to dismiss all claims in the litigation with prejudice 
in addition to the settlement agreement  we  avistar and cpi entered into a patent cross license agreement whereby non exclusive  fully paid up  worldwide patent licenses to the respective patent portfolios of each party and its subsidiaries were granted by us and our subsidiaries to avistar and its subsidiaries  including cpi  and by avistar and its subsidiaries to us and our subsidiaries 
we incurred a one time charge of million in and recorded million as a prepaid license 
we expect to amortize this prepaid license through the third quarter of  the expiration date of the patents in suit 
interest income  net interest income  net  consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts and imputed interest expense related to the present value of costs associated with closing facilities as part of the picturetel acquisition and related integration plan 
imputed interest expense was million for  million for and million for interest income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in and million in interest income increased in over due primarily to higher average interest rates  and to a lesser extent  increases in our average cash and investment balances 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income decreased in over due primarily to decreases in our average cash and investment balances  which was primarily due to cash outlays for the acquisition of voyant  purchases of our common stock and the litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of  and to a lesser extent lower average interest rates that were a result of monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income  net could fluctuate for due to movement in our cash balances and changes in interest rates related to monetary policy actions  if any  taken by the united states federal reserve board 
our cash balance may decrease depending upon our stock purchase activity and other factors 
gain loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in and  we made additional investments in two private companies totaling million and million  respectively 
in and  our investments were permanently written down million and million  respectively  from original cost  which is reflected in gain loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no amounts permanently written down in in  a privately held company in which we held an investment with a carrying value of million was sold  resulting in a gain of million which is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in gain loss on strategic investments 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were   and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  including taxes related to discontinued operations  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate in versus was related primarily to tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  as discussed below  which was partially offset by the decrease in purchased in process research and development  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective rate in versus was primarily the result of a one time charge for purchased in process research and development  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  million in tax credit carryovers and million in capital loss carryforwards  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law 
the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing a dividends received deduction of for certain dividends  as defined in the act 
during the fourth quarter of  we distributed million in cash from our foreign subsidiary and provided associated income tax expense of million 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  such as the current lapse in the us research and development tax credit 
segment information a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales  direct marketing and direct engineering expenses 
management allocates corporate manufacturing costs and some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include sales costs  marketing costs other than direct marketing  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related costs  amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets  purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring costs  litigation reserves and payments  interest income  net  gain loss on strategic investments  other expense  net  and provision for income taxes 
communications year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of communications revenues pts revenues from our communications segment for increased over  due primarily to increased sales volumes of our voice and video communications products 
video communications product revenues  which accounted for percentage points of the overall increase  grew from million in to million in  increasing million or over the increase in video communications product revenues was due primarily to increased sales volumes of our group video systems  which consisted primarily of our vsx product family 
voice communications product revenues  which accounted for percentage points of the overall increase  grew from million in to million in  increasing million or over the increase in voice communications product revenues in as compared to was due primarily to increased sales volumes of our voice over ip products and circuit switched products  and to a lesser extent  increases in our installed voice products 
revenues from our communications segment for increased over  due primarily to increased sales volumes of our video and voice communications products 
video communications product revenues  which accounted for percentage points of the overall increase  grew from million in to million in  increasing million or over the increase in video communications product revenues was due primarily to an increase in sales volumes of our group video systems  primarily our vsx and viewstation product families  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our ipower and desktop video products 
voice communications product revenues  which accounted for percentage points of the overall increase  grew from million in to million in  increasing million or over the increase in voice communications product revenues in as compared to was primarily as a result of increases in sales volumes of our voice over ip products and circuit switched products  and to a lesser extent  increases in our installed voice products 
international revenues  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of our total communications segment revenues for  and  respectively 
in  one channel partner accounted for of our total revenues for our communications segment 
no one customer accounted for of our total revenues for our communications segment in or the contribution margin as a percentage of communications segment revenues was in both and contribution margins remained consistent as gross margins were essentially flat in as compared to for both our video and voice communications products and engineering and direct marketing expenses decreased by less than percentage point as a percent of revenue  although increasing in absolute dollars in as compared to the contribution margin as a percentage of communications segment revenues for increased to as compared to in the increase in contribution margin for as compared to is primarily due to higher gross margins for both our video and voice communication products and decreases in engineering spending  partially offset by increases in direct marketing spending 
gross margins improved for as compared to due to increased revenues and improved product mix 
direct marketing and engineering spending in the communications segment will fluctuate depending upon the timing of product launches and marketing programs 
network systems year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of network systems revenue pts pt revenues from our network systems segment for decreased over to million  due primarily to decreased sales volumes of video network systems and lower revenues from system upgrades 
in addition  average selling prices on our video network systems declined slightly on a year over year basis  particularly on the low end products primarily as a result of increased competition 
revenues from our audio networking systems and software were essentially flat year over year 
revenues from our network systems segment for increased over to million  due primarily to sales of audio network systems as a result of our voyant acquisition and an increase in video network system revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in video network system upgrade revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a shift in product mix toward products with lower average selling prices 
international revenues  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total network systems revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in international network systems revenues as a percentage of network systems revenues for as compared to is due primarily to the concentration of audio network system revenues  which are attributable to the voyant acquisition  in north america 
for and  no one customer accounted for more than of network systems segment product revenues 
in  our network systems segment had two channel partners that together represented approximately of network systems segment product revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a long term material adverse affect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our network systems products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
in  we began selling our audio network systems  a product line resulting from the voyant acquisition  directly to end users and the revenues in this segment from end users are subject to more variability than our segment revenues from our reseller customers 
the loss of one or more of the audio network system customers in the network systems segment could have a material negative impact on our network systems segment and consolidated revenues 
the decrease in contribution margin as a percentage of network systems segment revenues for as compared to is due primarily to lower gross margins  and to a lesser extent  increased engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues 
this was partially offset by lower direct marketing expenses 
gross margins for network systems were lower in versus primarily due to a decrease in video network system volumes as well as lower average selling prices  particularly on low end products  primarily as a result of increased competition 
the increase in contribution margin as a percentage of network systems segment revenues for as compared to is due primarily to increased revenues and gross margins  partially offset by increased engineering expenses associated with audio network systems headcount and development spending as a result of the voyant acquisition 
gross margins for network systems were higher in versus primarily due to an increase in video network system upgrades  which were partially offset by decreases in gross margins as a result of an increase in volume but a mix shift to lower margin systems and lower gross margins on audio network system products 
services year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of service revenue pts pts revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to an increase in video maintenance services as a result of amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx product line  and increased video network systems services  and to a lesser extent  increases in audio network systems maintenance services 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in ipower related services 
revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to an increase in audio network systems services as a result of our voyant acquisition  and to a lesser extent  increases in video network systems maintenance services 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in ipower related services 
international revenues  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total service revenues for  and  respectively 
international revenues increased slightly in as compared to primarily as a result of increased service revenues associated with our video communications and network systems products 
the decrease in international services revenues as a percentage of services revenues for as compared to is due primarily to the concentration of audio network systems service revenues  which are attributable to the voyant acquisition  in north america 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for our services segment for  or overall  the increase in the services segment contribution margin in versus is due primarily to increased gross margins more than offsetting increases in operating expenses 
service gross margins increased for as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on network systems audio services 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
this impact was due to increased volumes of these products in as compared to overall  the increase in the services segment contribution margin in versus is due primarily to increased gross margins more than offsetting increases in operating expenses 
service gross margins increased for as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on network systems audio services as a result of the voyant acquisition 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
this impact was due to increased volumes of these products in as compared to  as represented the first full year of these services being included 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with a bank which was unused at december   however  we do have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  of which million are secured by this line of credit 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million  net of a million litigation settlement  in  and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  larger decreases in deferred taxes  larger increases in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities  smaller increases in accounts receivable and decreases in prepaids and other current assets  which were partially offset by smaller increases in accounts payable and increases in inventories 
the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable  smaller decreases in inventories and deferred taxes  and smaller increases in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities  which were partially offset by increased net income and non cash expenses  smaller increases in prepaids and other current assets and larger increases in accounts payable 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of property and equipment and million for the acquisition of dstmedia 
the primary sources of cash were million in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments  net of purchases  million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  and million from proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  gain from sale of discontinued operations  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  loss on strategic investments  the purchase of in process research and development and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in deferred taxes and prepaid expenses and other current assets and net increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net increases in trade receivables and inventories 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  as compared to days at december  this increase in dso was due primarily to the increase in trade receivables resulting from co op marketing reserves being recorded in other accrued liabilities instead of trade receivables in and longer payment terms for service providers and government entities from to and days  respectively 
the increase in dso as a result of the co op marketing change did not have an effect on our net income or cash flows 
we expect that dso will remain at these higher levels as compared to but could also increase as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities 
inventory turns decreased from turns at december  to turns at december  the reduction in turns primarily reflects increased inventory levels to support shortened lead times and increased product mix 
we believe inventory turns will continue to fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as  changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
additionally  payments we make for income taxes may increase in as our available net operating losses are depleted 
as part of the dstmedia acquisition  dstmedia shareholders may receive up to an additional million of consideration through  payable in cash  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones relating to the operating results of dstmedia 
dstmedia s results of operations have been included in our results of operations since august  from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total approximately million and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million through june  due under our current lease obligations 
for example  we lease an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for a term that is concurrent with the term of our lease obligation 
as a result we are not currently showing a lease obligation related to this facility 
if this sublease were to be terminated  or if the tenant defaulted on payment  we would incur additional lease payments that would negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands gross minimum lease payments estimated sublease receipts net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products as the service is performed  generally one to five years 
our video communications and network systems products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through our maintenance contracts 
accordingly  we account for revenue for these products in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
co op marketing funds are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
in order to fully utilize these deferred tax assets we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
we believe based upon our financial projections that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets and therefore  as of december   we have not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the picturetel acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intended to sublease or for which we intended to negotiate a lease termination settlement 
the allocation period for all material acquisitions  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has been completed 
therefore  if actual costs  other than the payment of certain earn outs  exceed our estimates  these charges would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the fourth quarters of and  we completed our annual goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of december  or the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amounts  impairment existed  and future cash flows were discounted and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of the impairment test  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
our intangible assets were not impaired as of december  we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had a carrying value of million as of december   and were permanently written down by million in and million in  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no amounts permanently written down in derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments and supersedes the current accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas no 
r is effective for all annual periods beginning after june  and addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under certain employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to the adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal and will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our operating results and financial condition 
the pro forma information in note of our consolidated financial statements presents the estimated compensation charges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result of the provisions of sfas r and sab  we expect the compensation charges under sfas r to reduce net income by approximately to million for fiscal however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we will recognize compensation cost for stock based awards issued after december  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp 
fsp provides guidance in accounting for obligations associated with directive ec the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment adopted by the european union 
fas is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which the company has significant operations 
the directive distinguishes between new and historical waste 
new waste relates to products put on the market after august  fsp directs commercial users to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and the related fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  for the measurement and recognition of the liability and asset retirement obligation associated with the historical waste management requirements of the directive 
additionally  fsp provides guidance for the accounting by producers for the financing of the obligations of historical waste held by private households 
we adopted fas in the first quarter of fiscal and concluded that no significant liability had been incurred as of december  we are continuing to analyze the impact of the directive  and fsp  on our financial position and results of operations as additional eu member countries adopt the directive 
separate from the requirements of fsp  we believe that the internal cost of compliance with the directive  and the liability associated with new waste obligations  which according to the directive is to be borne solely by the producers of the new equipment  was not significant for the year ended december   but could be significant in the future 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at december   none of our unrealized investment losses were recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
we do not believe fsp fas and fas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
the investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid  high quality instruments 
some investments in the portfolio may contain an embedded derivative  and interest rate hedges may be placed if they are tied to a specific investment or group of investments in accordance with our investment policy  however  they are generally not significant 
we may occasionally use forward contracts as a hedge against currency exchange rate fluctuations  which may affect the value of trade receivables billed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as of december   we have no open foreign currency hedging contracts 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us  state and municipal government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities 
if we sell our short term or long term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands issuer valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points current fair market value valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps us government securities state and local governments corporate debt securities total the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a six month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points current fair market value valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer bps bps bps bps us government securities state and local governments corporate debt securities total until january  a substantial majority of our sales were denominated in us dollars 
effective january   we commenced selling our products and services in our european and united kingdom regions in euros and british pounds  which has increased our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  in the event that a significant transaction were due in a foreign currency  we might enter into a foreign currency forward exchange contract for hedging purposes 
as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increases  we may begin a hedging program 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of december  or
