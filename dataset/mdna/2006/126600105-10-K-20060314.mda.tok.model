item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations 
general management s discussion and analysis is written to provide greater detail of the results of operations and the financial condition of cvb financial corp 
and its subsidiaries 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements contained within this report including the notes thereto 
overview we are a bank holding company with one bank subsidiary  citizens business bank 
we have two other active subsidiaries  community trust deed services  which is owned by cvb financial corp 
and golden west enterprises  inc  which is owned by the bank 
we have three other inactive subsidiaries cvb ventures  inc  chino valley bancorp and onb bancorp 
we are also the common stockholder of cvb statutory trust i  cvb statutory trust ii  and cvb statutory trust iii 
trusts i and ii were created in december and trust iii was created in january to issue trust preferred securities in order to raise capital for the company 
we are based in ontario  california in what is known as the inland empire 
our geographical market area encompasses madera the middle of the central valley in the center of california to laguna beach in orange county in the southern portion of california 
our mission is to offer the finest financial products and services to professionals and businesses in our market area 
our primary source of income is from the interest earned on our loans and investments and our primary area of expense is the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
as such  our net income is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our earnings 
we believe the recent rise in interest rates may relieve some of the pressure on our net interest margin 
we are also subject to competition from other financial institutions  which may affect our pricing of products and services  and the fees and interest rates we can charge on them 
economic conditions in our california service area impact our business 
the economy of this area has not experienced the decline that other areas of the state and country have witnessed during the past few years 
the job market continues to strengthen in the central valley and inland empire 
however  we are still subject to changes in the economy in our market area 
although we do not provide mortgages on single family residences  we still benefit from construction growth in southern california since we provide construction loans to builders 
southern california is experiencing growth in construction on single family residences and commercial buildings  and our balance sheet at december  reflects that growth from december  a slow down in construction will have an impact on our balance sheet and earnings 
over the past few years  we have been active in acquisitions and we will continue to pursue acquisition targets which will enable us to meet our business objectives and enhance shareholder value 
since  we have acquired four banks and a leasing company  and we have opened four de novo branches  glendale  bakersfield  fresno and madera 
in we implemented our central valley initiative which is intended to grow our presence in the southern central valley of california 
this area has a large agribusiness economy and fits in well with agribusiness lending portfolio 
this portion of the state is the largest agricultural area in the nation 
we began this initiative in december of with the opening of our bakersfield business financial center 
we added one de novo business financial center in fresno in the second quarter of and another de novo business financial center in madera in the second quarter of our acquisition of kaweah national bank in september with business financial centers in visalia  tulare  porterville and 
table of contents mcfarland further complimented the initiative 
we currently have seven business financial centers and one leasing office in the central valley 
our growth in loans and investments during compared with and the increasing interest rate environment has allowed our interest income to grow in as compared to the same period in the preceding year we did increase our borrowings from the fhlb in to assist in the growth of investments and the related interest income on these investments 
the result of the increase in loan  investment and deposit balances and overall increase in interest rates resulted in an increase of net interest income to million in from million in however  the increase in interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings has resulted in a decrease in net interest margin te from in to in the bank has always had a base of interest free deposits because we specialize in businesses and professionals as deposit customers 
this has allowed us to have a low cost of deposits  currently at for in  we restructured a portion of our investment portfolio in anticipation of a rising interest rate environment 
this restructuring had the effect of shortening the duration of the portfolio and we realized security gains of million in the purpose of the restructuring was to sell those securities which would not perform well in a rising rate environment 
the shortening in the duration of the portfolio will allow for an increase in cash flow or liquidity so that the reinvestment of the cash flow will occur at higher rates 
during the first quarter of  we wrote down the carrying value of two issues of federal home loan mortgage association preferred stock 
these securities pay dividends based on libor and perform like a bond 
since there was a loss of value that was determined to be other than temporary  we charged million against earnings in the first quarter of to adjust for the impairment of the issues of preferred stock 
this was partially offset by the million in security gains taken in the second quarter we took these gains on short maturity securities before rates rose and the gains disappeared 
we recorded an additional charge of million on these securities at december  although the preferred stock resets with libor one issue resets to the month libor rate every months and the other resets to the month libor every twelve months  the price of the freddie mac preferred stock has not moved up accordingly 
for additional information regarding these charges  see analysis of financial condition investment securities 
in the third quarter of  we sold a building that housed the pasadena business financial center and our financial advisory services group 
we are leasing this space back from the purchaser of the building 
we realized a gain of million from this transaction 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we could only recognize the gain on that portion of the building that we previously leased to third parties in current year income 
this resulted in gain recognition of  in the remaining portion of the gain  million was deferred and is being amortized over the lives of the leases we have for the pasadena business financial center and the financial advisory services group 
during  we recognized  of the deferred gain as a reduction of rental expense 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired a new building for our data center 
we out grew our old data center  which we also owned 
we moved into the new facility in the third quarter of and have opened escrow on the sale of the old facility 
our total occupancy expense  exclusive of furniture and equipment expense  for the year ended december   was million 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our present purposes 
the company believes that if necessary  it could secure suitable alternative facilities on similar terms without adversely affecting operations
