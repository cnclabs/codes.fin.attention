item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to operating results  new product introductions and sales  competitive conditions  capital expenditures and resources  manufacturing capacity utilization  customer demand and inventory levels  intellectual property issues  and the risk factors set forth in the section factors affecting future results 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
unless otherwise required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these statements for future events or new information after the date of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements  which are generally identified by words such as anticipates  expects  plans  and similar terms  include statements related to revenues and gross profit  restructuring and asset impairment charges  research and development activities  selling  general  and administrative expenses  intangible expenses  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry and overall economic conditions and demand  and capacity utilization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances 
however  actual future results may vary from our estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require significant management judgment and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain or subjective 
we also have other important policies  including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are significant  difficult or subjective 
these policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we consider various tax planning strategies  forecasts of future taxable income and our most recent operating results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the consideration of the realizability of net deferred tax assets  recent results must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for any of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
our assumptions regarding the ultimate realization of these assets remained unchanged in fiscal and and accordingly  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
in addition  we record liabilities related to income tax contingencies 
determining these liabilities requires us to make significant estimates of  and judgments regarding whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due based on potential tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits as well as the precedents set in tax cases which include similar tax positions to those taken by the company 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we will adjust the liability and affect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record reserves for obsolete and excess inventory based on our forecasts of demand over specific future time horizons 
we also record reserves to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market which rely on forecasts of average selling prices asps in future periods 
actual market conditions  demand  and pricing levels in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecasts  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we own and operate our own manufacturing facilities  as described in part i of this annual report  and have also acquired certain businesses and product portfolios in recent years 
as a result we have significant property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate these items for impairment on an annual basis  or earlier  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
triggering events for impairment reviews may include adverse industry or economic trends  significant restructuring actions  lowered projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
evaluations of possible impairment and  if applicable  adjustments to carrying values  require us to estimate  among other factors  future cash flows  useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets 
actual results may vary from our expectations 
we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of million  million  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment reviews during the fourth quarters of fiscal   and these reviews found no impairment 
under our accounting policy we will continue to perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each future fiscal year  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
our annual reviews consider estimates of the fair value of our reporting units and may include analyses of projected discounted cash flows using our estimates of future revenues and expenses over a multi year horizon 
as of april   our assets included billion in goodwill related to our acquisitions of ics  zettacom  newave and solidum 
as of april   our assets included million in goodwill 
overview during fiscal  we have made significant improvements towards achieving our operating targets 
our restructuring actions have improved our fixed cost structure for manufacturing  reduced our facilities costs  and lowered the costs of a variety of our production and administrative activities 
following our merger with ics  we have a greater diversity of products and enhanced research and development capability which allow us to pursue broader market opportunities 
we also expect to realize significant economies of scale in manufacturing through better factory utilization and improved purchasing leverage 
in addition  during fiscal  we began to realize the benefits of our investments in key new product areas such as nses  fb dimms  serial switching products  and timing solutions for the communications and computing markets 
we expect these products to drive significant revenue growth in the coming fiscal year 
results of operations revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the ics revenues for the periods subsequent to the close of the merger 
overall  average selling prices asps per unit for our products decreased during fiscal as products acquired through our merger with ics historically carry overall lower asps than the our historic idt products 
units sold increased significantly as a result of the ics merger 
revenues for our networking segment which includes network search engines  switching solutions  flow control management devices  fifos  multi port products  and integrated communications processors increased by million or 
revenues for our timing segment which includes clock management  dimm support and other timing solution products increased by million or driven primarily by revenues from the ics acquisition 
revenues for our standard products and other segment which includes high speed sram  military applications  digital logic  telecommunications and video products decreased by million or 
units sold increased significantly in the timing segment as the majority of the ics products have been included in this segment post merger  while units sold decreased slightly in our networking segment and units sold in our standard products and other segment decreased significantly primarily in our digital logic and sram commodity businesses 
as a result of favorable shifts in product mix  asps increased for the year within our networking segment  while asps in both of our other segments decreased during the year 
during fiscal  the asia pacific region apac increased significantly as a percentage of our worldwide revenues  representing due primarily to the concentration of emss in the region which assemble our end customer platforms and the strength of the ics business in the region 
the americas  japan  and europe represented   and  respectively of worldwide revenues in fiscal revenues recent trends and outlook 
due to the impact of a full year of revenues following our merger with ics  along with the expected ramp of new and existing products  we currently expect revenues to increase significantly in fiscal revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the previous year 
overall average selling prices asps per unit for our products increased by during fiscal as a result of favorable changes in the mix of products sold and better pricing for sram products during a portion of the year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in overall units sold from million units in fiscal to million units in fiscal  which we believe is attributable to efforts by our customers to realign their inventory levels after the pace of market recovery last year was more modest than many originally expected 
revenues for our networking segment increased significantly during fiscal primarily as a result of strength in the nse business 
revenues for the timing segment increased moderately while revenues in the standard products and other segment increased during fiscal during fiscal  we experienced growth in each of the regions throughout the world with the americas leading the increase  up 
revenues in europe  apac  and japan also increased by   and  respectively  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of our worldwide revenues  the apac region represented the largest percentage at due primarily to the concentration of emss in the region which assemble our end customer platforms 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease in our gross profit is primarily attributable to costs related to our merger with ics and acquisition of freescale assets  including million of intangible asset amortization and the incremental cost related to the sale of acquired inventory  valued at fair market value less an estimated selling cost 
in addition  we recorded impairments and charges related to our restructuring actions totaling million 
offsetting effects primarily relate to a significant increase in revenues  sales of units with higher standard margins from acquired businesses  including ics  and improved utilization of internal manufacturing capacity  including the closure of our production facility in the philippines 
our gross profit also benefited from our spending improvements related to restructuring measures  including a reduction in force of employees and the consolidation of six facilities into a single corporate headquarters 
in addition  we estimate that gross profit benefited in fiscal by approximately million related to the sale of product previously written down and that gross profit in fiscal was lower by million as a result of additional excess or obsolete reserves 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to the significant increase in revenues discussed above  improved manufacturing utilization  a higher proportion of our wafers at micron and finer geometries  improved sram pricing during part of the year  and lower pricing related inventory reserve requirements 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received a sales tax refund from the state of california of million related to the manufacturers investment credit 
as this amount was originally recorded in connection with capital purchases in manufacturing and r d  we allocated the credit back to cost of revenues and r d expense based on a ratio consistent with the purchases in the years to which the credit applied 
this contributed a benefit of million to gross margin 
depreciation and technology amortization expenses were higher by million and million  respectively  due to capital expenditures during the current and prior fiscal years and the acquisition of zettacom 
allocations of manufacturing spending to r d were higher by approximately million 
we estimate that gross profit during fiscal was lower by million as a result of additional excess or obsolete reserves versus a million benefit in fiscal related to the sale of product previously reserved as excess 
restructuring and impairment 
in fiscal years and  as part of an effort to streamline operations and increase profitability  we implemented reductions in force that impacted many of our operations  including our northern california and oregon operations  our assembly and test facility in the philippines and our design center in australia 
restructuring actions in q  we initiated a reduction in force  primarily affecting our manufacturing workforce in oregon  in an effort to streamline operations and improve profitability 
this action resulted in the reduction of approximately employees 
we recorded million in q  which was equivalent to the portion guaranteed each employee by policy  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
these charges were recorded as cost of revenues 
in q  we completed the consolidation of our northern california operations to our san jose headquarters and exited leased facilities in salinas and santa clara 
upon exiting these leases we recorded lease impairment charges of approximately million  which represents the future rental payments under the leases  reduced by an estimate of sublease income  discounted to present value using an interest rate applicable to the company 
we also wrote off certain leasehold improvements and assets no longer in use of approximately million 
these charges were recorded as cost of revenues of million  r d of million  and sg a of million 
as of april   approximately million of these lease payments have been made 
in q  we announced our plans to consolidate our assembly and test operations and outsource a portion of our assembly operations 
under the plan  we closed our assembly and test facility in the philippines  which affected approximately employees 
these employees were paid a severance component equivalent to that required by the philippine labor code and an additional amount based upon the number of years of service to the company 
these charges were recorded as cost of revenues of million 
the restructuring action was completed q the facility s surrounding land and equipment was classified as held for sale in q in q  we also incurred million in restructuring charges  which primarily consisted of severance and related termination benefits within our sales organization  as well as exit costs related to our lease facility in france 
in fiscal  we implemented a reduction in force  which resulted in the reduction of approximately employees across all aspects of our operations 
we recorded restructuring charges of million  which primarily consisted of severance and related termination benefits 
the charges were recorded as cost of revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
through april   approximately million has been paid 
the remaining severance and termination benefits related to these activities are scheduled to be paid in q as part of the announced plan for the january reductions in force  a portion of the employees remained with the company over a retention period 
we recorded cumulative retention costs of million through april   of which million and million were recorded in fiscal and  respectively 
during q  in conjunction with the merger with ics  the company extended the retention period for certain employees involved with integration activities 
we anticipate recording an additional million of retention costs related to these activities in q and to substantially complete the restructuring activity at the end of q restructuring actions in connection with the ics merger in q  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million related to severance costs for idt employees who were terminated in conjunction with our merger with ics 
this action resulted in the reduction of six employees from our sales and manufacturing organizations 
these amounts were recorded as million as cost of revenues and sg a of million 
all amounts related to this action were paid in fiscal in q  we announced our plan to close our design center in sydney  australia  due to overlapping projects and teams acquired in conjunction with the merger with ics 
the closure resulted in a reduction in force of approximately r d employees 
in q  we recorded approximately million of severance costs related to these employees 
retention costs  which will be earned by employees through the planned closure date in may  will be expensed as incurred 
in q  we paid million of severance costs related to these activities and expect to substantially complete the closure in q sale of previously impaired assets during fiscal  we sold equipment from our salinas wafer fabrication facility  which had been previously impaired as part of the fiscal impairment charges 
as the proceeds from these sales exceeded the impaired value of the assets  we recorded a credit to restructuring and impairment of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no such proceeds in fiscal intangible impairment during q  we determined that certain intangible assets related to our acquisition of newave had become impaired as the tradename is no longer utilized in our marketing strategy 
as such  we recorded a charge of million to sg a expense  to write off the remaining value of the intangible asset 
anticipated annual savings for fiscal as a result of restructuring actions taken in fiscal are as follows in millions cogs r d sg a total compensation related facilities other total the above table includes anticipated savings from restructuring actions initiated in fiscal and  as well as the anticipated savings resulting from headcount related synergies following our merger with ics 
the above table does not include the offsetting costs of retention and severance for those employees who were affected by our reductions in force 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal includes the results of ics beginning september  the following table presents our operating expenses for fiscal years  and  respectively in thousands april  of net revenues april  of net revenues march  of net revenues research and development selling  general and administrative research and development 
research and development r d expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases were primarily due to employee related expenses  which increased million as a result of our merger with ics  along with severance costs recorded in connection with the closure of our design center in australia and other reductions in force  partially offset by cost savings associated with our restructuring activities 
in addition  indirect materials and equipment expenses increased million and million  respectively  due to higher product development activity as a result of our merger with ics 
outside services also increased million due to increased costs associated with the integration of ics and the services in conjunction with the exit of our facility in santa clara 
finally  we recorded lease impairment charges of million  primarily associated with the consolidation of our northern california operations into our san jose headquarters in q and a change in sublease assumptions for our former salinas facility in q  related to ongoing lease obligations 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in allocations of manufacturing costs to r d activities of million  due primarily to the closure of our assembly and test facility in the philippines 
r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in labor related spending of million mainly from increased headcount and retention costs incurred in connection with the zettacom acquisition during fiscal and performance related personnel costs in connection with the improved financial results 
allocations of manufacturing costs to r d activities increased by million  reflecting a higher proportional usage of manufacturing infrastructure by r d 
partially offsetting these amounts was a sales tax refund allocation of million related to equipment purchases in previous fiscal years explained above in the gross margin discussion 
in addition  deferred compensation expense in connection with our acquisition of newave was lower by million as a result of the completion of the vesting provisions of arrangements with certain key newave employees 
finally  product development related expenses including photomask decreased compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  we anticipate that our new product development efforts will be focused in the following areas networking and switching products such as our network search engines incorporating content addressable memory or cam technology  flow control management devices  such as and multi ported specialty memory products  and timing and clock products for communications and computing applications 
in addition  we expect significant product development efforts in our newly formed serial switching division  including switch fabric and traffic management technologies 
we expect r d spending in fiscal to increase significantly compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to the impact of a full year of a larger r d organization following our merger with ics and stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets  which increased million as a result of our merger with ics and the purchase of freescale assets in q in addition  our employee related expenses increased million  as a result of our merger with ics and severance charges resulting from reductions in force  partially offset by cost savings associated with our restructuring activities 
sales representative commissions also increased million primarily as a result of increased revenue following our merger with ics 
outside services increased million due to costs associated with our merger with ics  tax consulting services related to our tax planning strategies and hia dividends and the exit of our facilities in santa clara 
finally  we recorded lease impairment charges of million  primarily associated with the consolidation of our northern california operations into our san jose headquarters in q and a change in lease assumptions for our former salinas facility in q  related to ongoing lease obligations 
sg a expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to higher performance related personnel costs in fiscal  increased spending on outside services  such as consulting and auditing services in connection with sarbanes oxley section compliance and increased sales related expenses  including rep commissions 
these amounts were partially offset by lower equipment depreciation costs and bad debt reserve requirements 
we currently expect the sg a expenses to increase significantly compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to the impact of a full year of a larger sg a organization following our merger with ics  increased variable sales expenses on higher revenues  the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  and stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
acquired in process research and development 
during fiscal  in conjunction with our acquisition of ics  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d 
during fiscal  in conjunction with our acquisition of zettacom  we recorded a million charge for acquired ipr d 
in addition we recorded a million ipr d charge related to follow on payments during fiscal related to our acquisition of certain technologies for use in high speed packet processing from ibm 
during fiscal  in connection with the ibm transaction  we recorded a million charge for ipr d 
for each of these transactions  the allocation of the purchase price to ipr d was determined by identifying technologies that had not attained technological feasibility and that did not have future alternative uses 
details of significant ipr d charges are as follows in connection with the merger with ics  we recorded a million charge to ipr d 
projects that qualify as ipr d represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirement 
the value of ipr d was determined by considering the importance of each project to the company s overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value based on the percentage of completion of the ipr d projects 
the company utilized the discounted cash flow dcf method to value the ipr d  using rates ranging from to  depending on the estimated useful life of the technology 
based on the relatively few number of projects underway at the close of our merger with ics and the significant leverage on existing technology of in process projects  ipr d was not considered significant component of the acquired business 
in connection with the zettacom acquisition  we recorded a million charge to ipr d 
this amount was determined by identifying a project under development which was not yet proven to be technically feasible and did not have alternative future uses 
estimated future expenses were deducted and economic rents charged for the use of other assets 
based on this analysis  a present value calculation of estimated after tax cash flows attributable to the projects was computed using a discount rate of 
present values were adjusted by factors representing the percentage of completion for the project  which was estimated at 
this project was completed during the second half of fiscal other than temporary impairment loss on investments 
during q  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million on certain available for sale investments  the fair value of which had gradually decreased over the prior twelve months as a result of interest rate increases 
this action was based upon the magnitude and length of time these securities had been in a continuous unrealized loss position and in consideration of our near term cash requirements related to the merger with ics 
during fiscal and we recorded no such charges 
gains losses on equity investments  net 
activity for the periods presented is summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal other than temporary impairment on netlogic shares realized gains on sales of pmc shares gains losses on equity investments  net during q  we recorded an impairment of million related to our investment in netlogic microsystems netlogic 
shortly after the end of q netlogic completed its initial public offering ipo at an offering price of per share 
we were included as a selling shareholder in connection with the offering 
the ipo pricing  less related commissions implied the investment was worth less than its carrying value 
based on the relative magnitude of the decline in value  we concluded that there was an other than temporary impairment of the investment at june  and accordingly  recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value down to its estimated net realizable value 
during q  we sold of our investment at the previously written down value 
during fiscal  we sold our remaining shares of pmc sierra pmc resulting in a net gain of million 
interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income other income  net interest income and other  net the million increase in interest income in fiscal is primarily attributed to the increase in interest rates that occurred throughout the fiscal year offset slightly by the reduction in cash balances that occurred at the end of q as a result of the ics merger 
the million decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of our acquisition activity and the purchase of our new headquarters in san jose  ca  offset by an increase in interest rates during the latter half of the fiscal year 
the million decrease in other income  net in fiscal is attributable to losses realized on the sale of short term investments as we completed our funding obligations for the ics merger and the foreign dividends declarations under the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the million decrease in other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower gains recognized on the sale of short term investments 
provision benefit for income taxes 
as a result of significant net deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the ics acquisition  the company decreased its valuation allowance in q by approximately million  which was included as part of the purchase price allocation 
while the company generated taxable income for fiscal years  and  we cannot conclude it is more likely than not we will be able to utilize our net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
remaining uncertainties associated with the acquisition and integration of ics as well as the effect of recent corporate legal organization changes compromises the ability to forecast the utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we also believe the ics acquisition and the legal organization changes cause the historical results to not be indicative of expected future performance 
as such  we have determined that maintaining the balance of the valuation allowance  after giving effect to net deferred tax liabilities associated with the ics acquisition  is still appropriate at the end of fiscal the provision for income taxes from operations  except for discrete items  primarily reflects foreign income taxes and us alternative minimum taxes as well as us state taxes that were higher in fiscal compared to prior years as a result of additional taxes associated with the acquisition of ics 
the company s tax provision for fy includes tax expense of approximately million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings of approximately million during the year under the ajca 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria in the ajca are met 
the company will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan that conforms to the ajca guidelines 
in connection with the repatriated foreign earnings  the company reversed approximately million of deferred tax liabilities in fiscal  which were no longer required following the distribution of certain earnings under ajca 
we also reversed approximately million of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with a reduction in anticipated withholding taxes on distributions from the philippines associated with the wind down of such operations 
in fiscal  as a result of a partial settlement with the irs pertaining to its examination of certain items in the company s income tax returns for fiscal years through  the company recorded a net reduction in its income taxes payable of million as a partial settlement 
the examination by the irs of the company s income tax returns for fiscal years through has not yet been concluded 
in fiscal  we signed an advanced pricing agreement apa with the internal revenue service settling an issue related to transfer pricing 
as a result  in fiscal we made cash payments attributable to withholding taxes in the philippines of approximately million 
upon signing the apa we reduced our related tax reserve by a net million 
also  in connection with the announced closure of our philippine manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million tax provision resulting from the potential repatriation of related earnings to the united states 
the tax benefit recorded for fiscal includes million for tax refunds we received related to previous tax years 
the benefit of these refunds was partially offset by tax expense related to income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and available for sale investments were million at april   a decrease of million  compared to april  the decrease is primarily attributable to our merger with ics and the acquisition of freescale assets in q  which resulted in net cash outflows of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had no outstanding debt at april  or april  we recorded a net loss of million in fiscal compared to net income of million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to in fiscal a summary of the significant changes in non cash adjustments affecting net income loss are as follows amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to our merger with ics and acquisition of freescale assets in q depreciation expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to our merger with ics 
we recorded restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal approximately million was recorded in q in conjunction with the exit of our leased facilities in salinas and santa clara 
in q we recorded an additional million and million related to a change in the sublease assumptions for our former salinas facility and the impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in conjunction with our acquisition of newave in fiscal  respectively 
we adjusted our net deferred tax liabilities by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in deferred taxes in fiscal significantly results from the reversal of liabilities in foreign jurisdictions due to the ajca dividends and a reduction in anticipated withholding taxes on distributions from the philippines associated with the wind down of such operations 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million in q related to investments in our portfolio which had been trading at below cost for more than months  compared to a million charge in q related to the impairment of our investment in netlogic 
net use of cash related to working capital related items improved million  from a use of million in fiscal to a source of million in fiscal working capital items consuming relatively more cash during fiscal included an increase in accounts receivable of million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal  primarily attributable to higher revenues as a result of our merger with ics 
a decrease in income taxes payable of million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is attributable to the net reduction of approximately million of previously accrued tax reserves in conjunction with our receiving a final determination from the irs on certain audit issues for fiscal through and the reversal of certain foreign jurisdiction deferred tax liabilities  offset by taxes associated with the repatriation of cash under the ajca 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to the partial reduction of previously accrued tax reserves in connection with an audit settlement with the irs in q a decrease in other liabilities of million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal  primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred license revenue  retention costs associated with the closure of our assembly and test facility in the philippines  and the timing of a royalty related payment 
the factors listed above were offset by other working capital items that provided relatively more cash during fiscal a decrease in inventories of million in fiscal  compared to an increase of million in fiscal  primarily attributable to the sale of acquired inventory  valued at fair market value less an estimated selling cost 
a decrease in prepayments and other assets of million in fiscal  compared to an increase of million in fiscal  primarily related to lower amounts of interest receivable attributable to the liquidation of a large part of our investment portfolio in connection with our merger with ics 
an increase in accounts payable of million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million  primarily attributable to elevated purchasing activity in fiscal required to support our expanded operations 
an increase in accrued compensation of million in fiscal  compared to an increase of million  primarily attributable to additional costs associated with improved financial performance 
an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors of million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of million  primarily attributable to the addition of ics distributors in the united states 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to a realignment of distributor inventory levels to meet customer demand 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal a majority of the increase relates to cash provided by net income adjusted for non cash items  including increases in the amortization of intangible assets  deferred taxes and impairment charges 
in addition  working capital sources of cash included a decrease in accounts receivable  net and an increase in accrued compensation 
accounts receivable  net decreased as a result the timing of customer payments 
accrued compensation increased as a result of the timing of payroll  with two weeks accrued at the end of fiscal versus one week at the end of fiscal working capital uses of cash included an increase in inventories and prepayments and other assets  and decreases in deferred income on shipments to distributors  accounts payable and income taxes payable 
inventories increased in anticipation of customer demand 
the net effect on prepayments and other assets was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from the sales of building and equipment at our former facility in salinas  and the receipt of approximately million related to a distributor financing arrangement  both of which occurred in and did not recur in the decrease in deferred income on shipments was attributable to our distributors managing inventory levels more cautiously in than in the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of payments 
finally  the decrease in income taxes payable was attributable to a partial settlement with the irs related to an audit performed in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal net proceeds from the sale and maturity of our short term investments were approximately million  compared to net proceeds of million in fiscal the increase in investing activities in fiscal was attributable to an increase in our acquisition related expenditures  which were significantly higher than in fiscal  primarily as a result of our merger with ics 
in q  we paid approximately million and million  net of cash acquired  in conjunction with the merger with ics and the acquisition of freescale assets  respectively 
in q  we acquired zettacom for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
finally  capital expenditures in fiscal were lower by approximately million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the purchase of our new san jose corporate headquarters in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our acquisition related expenditures were significantly higher as we paid million  net of cash acquired  in connection with the acquisition of zettacom 
other than the zettacom transaction  various technology acquisitions consumed million in cash in fiscal  down from million in in fiscal  our sales of short term investments  net of purchases  were million higher than in the comparable period of fiscal finally  capital expenditures in fiscal were higher by million as we purchased a new corporate campus and  earlier in the year  new equipment primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity early in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the primary source of cash was attributable to the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
the primary use of cash was attributable to the repurchase of approximately million of common stock under the share repurchase program 
in fiscal  we repurchased approximately million of common stock under the share repurchase program and made payments of million for leases and debt 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to cash generated of million in fiscal the primary source of cash was attributable to the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
the primary use of cash was attributable to the repurchase of approximately million of common stock under the share repurchase program 
there were no such purchases in fiscal finally  lease and debt payments in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal to be financed through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at april   excluding leases where amounts have been accrued for impairment charges  and the expected timing and effects of these commitments on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period total less than year years years operating leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent binding contractual obligations  as purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  which generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation prior to services being performed without significant penalty 
in addition  the table above excludes leases where amounts have been accrued for impairment charges 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal we may choose to investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas r  share based payments sfas r see discussion below 
in particular  sab provides key guidance related to valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas r  the classification of compensation expense  capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payments 
generally  the requirements of sfas r are similar to those of sfas  however  sfas r requires companies to recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the payments 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
the company is required to adopt sfas r beginning with the first quarter of its fiscal year sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that are unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method and also permits companies to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption using the amounts previously calculated for pro forma disclosure under sfas the company will begin applying the modified prospective method under sfas r beginning in q as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options through its consolidated statements of operations but rather  discloses the effect in its consolidated financial statement footnotes 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas r 
the company is currently not able to estimate the stock compensation expense for the year ending april  due to the fact that the expense amount will depend on the timing and magnitude of new awards  the number and mix of new awards  changes in the market price or the volatility of the company s common stock 
however  we currently estimate that the impact on our first fiscal quarter will be between per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investments of million as of april  by policy  we limit our exposure to long term investments and mitigate the credit risk through diversification and adherence to a policy requiring the purchase of highly rated securities 
as of april   the company s cash and investment portfolio was highly concentrated in securities with same day liquidity and at the end of fiscal a substantial majority of our investment portfolio had maturities of less than two years 
although a hypothetical change in interest rates could have a material effect on the value of our portfolio at a given time  we normally hold these investments until maturity  which results in no realized impact on results of operations or cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
in addition  we maintain a portfolio of investments for certain deferred compensation arrangements  the fair value of which was million as of april  the portfolio is managed to achieve the same investment allocation as the participants directed investment election  which is classified in other long term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet 
at april   we had no outstanding debt

we may use derivative financial instruments to help manage our foreign currency exchange exposures 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis as of april  and determined that  without hedging the exposure  a change in the value of the us dollar would result in an approximate impact on gross profit margin percentage  as we operate manufacturing facilities in malaysia and singapore  and an approximate impact to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as we operate sales offices in japan and throughout europe and design centers in china  canada  and australia 
at april  we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
we have one outstanding payable for capital equipment denominated in a foreign currency in an amount equivalent to less than two hundred thousand us dollars as of april  we did not have any currency exposure related to any outstanding capital purchases as of april
