the company s allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient the company maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense that represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the company s control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  the company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly  which includes testing certain individual loans as well as collective pools of loans for impairment 
this evaluation includes an assessment of actual loss experience within each category of the portfolio  individual commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weakness  current economic events  including employment statistics  trends in bankruptcy filings  and other pertinent factors  industry or geographic concentrations  and regulatory guidance

customers may default on the repayment of loans city national s customers may default on the repayment of loans  which may negatively impact the company s earnings due to loss of principal and interest income 
increased operating expenses may result from the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of the loan 
collection efforts may or may not be successful causing the company to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan  which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan 

table of contents previously securitized loans may become impaired city national s previously securitized loans may become impaired  requiring an impairment charge to be recognized through the company s provision for loan losses 
the company accounts for the previously securitized loans by accreting into income the original discount on these loans based on their estimated collectibility 
this requires the company to make estimates for prepayments and defaults on previously securitized loans 
should any of the actual prepayments or defaults adversely impact collectibiltiy of these loans  the company would be required to take an impairment charge on the previously securitized loans 
see the section captioned retained interests and previously securitized loans in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the company s process for determining the appropriate valuation of the company s previously securitized loans 
due to increased competition  the company may not be able to attract and retain banking customers at current levels the company faces competition from the following local  regional and national banks  savings and loans  internet banks  credit unions  finance companies  and brokerage firms serving the company s market areas 
in particular  city national s competitors include several major national financial and banking companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions may have products and services not offered by the company  which may cause current and potential customers to choose those institutions 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits and range and quality of services provided 
if the company is unable to attract new and retain current customers  loan and deposit growth could decrease causing the company s results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted 
the company may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets  causing its financial condition and results to be negatively affected when the company acquires a business  a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired 
at december   the company s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately million 
under current accounting standards  if the company determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  it would be required to write down the value of these assets 
the company conducts an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired 
the company recently completed such an impairment analysis and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended december  the company cannot provide assurance whether it will be required to take an impairment charge in the future 
any impairment charge would have a negative effect on its shareholders equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price 

table of contents acquisition opportunities may present challenges the company continually evaluates opportunities to acquire other businesses 
however  the company may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future  which could negatively impact the growth of its business 
the company expects that other banking and financial companies  many of which have significantly greater resources  will compete with it to acquire compatible businesses 
this competition could increase prices for acquisitions that the company would likely pursue  and its competitors may have greater resources than it does 
also  acquisitions of regulated businesses such as banks are subject to various regulatory approvals 
if the company fails to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals  it will not be able to consummate an acquisition that it believes is in its best interests 
any future acquisitions may result in unforeseen difficulties  which could require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed at developing our existing business 
in addition  we could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which we may become responsible 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures

any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may not be able to attract and retain skilled people the company s success depends  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the company can be intense and the company may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of the company s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the company s business because of their skills  knowledge of the company s market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel
