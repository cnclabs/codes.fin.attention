industry overview we sell our security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems primarily to end users  while we design and manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems primarily for original equipment manufacturers 
security 
a variety of technologies are currently used worldwide in security and inspection applications  including computed tomography  transmission and backscatter x ray  metal detection  trace detection and x ray  gamma ray and neutron analysis 
we believe that the market for security and inspection products will continue to be affected by the threat of terrorist incidents and by new government mandates and appropriations for security and inspection products in the united states and internationally 
the september  terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon using hijacked airliners has led to nationwide shifts in transportation and facilities security policies 
shortly following these attacks  congress passed the aviation and transportation security act and integrated many us security related agencies  including the federal aviation administration  into the us department of homeland security 
under its directive from congress  the us department of homeland security has since undertaken numerous projects such as ones designed to distinguish terrorists from benign visitors entering the country  to prevent terrorists from obtaining and trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and their components  to secure sensitive us technologies and to identify and screen high risk cargo containers before they are loaded onto vessels destined for the us  among others 
these projects  known  for example  as the strategic border initiative  the customs trade partnership against terrorism and the us customs and border protection container security initiative  have resulted in an increased demand for security and inspection products both in the united states and other nations 
projects underway in the united states  such as the us customs and border protection container security initiative and the customs trade partnership against terrorism  have created a ripple effect in other areas of the world because they call on other nations to bolster their port security strategies  including by acquiring or improving their security and inspection equipment 
the international market for non intrusive inspection equipment  therefore  continues to expand as countries that ship goods directly to the united states are required to improve their security infrastructure 
furthermore  the us department of homeland security s science and technology directorate has supported the development of new security inspection technologies and products 
our security division participates in a number of such research and development efforts  including projects to develop new 
table of contents technologies for radiation and nuclear materials detection  aviation screening and suicide bomber detection 
the science and technology directorate has also initiated programs for the development of technologies capable of protecting highways  railways and waterways from terrorist attack 
in addition to these homeland protection activities  the us department of defense has also begun to invest more heavily in technologies and services that screen would be attackers before they are able to harm us and allied forces 
similar initiatives by international organizations such as the european union have also resulted in a growing worldwide demand for airline  cargo  port and border inspection technologies 
for example  the european union is expected to issue uniform performance standards for people  cargo  mail and parcel and hold baggage screening systems as well as new directives related specifically to maritime security 
we anticipate that the promulgation of these new standards will establish performance baselines against which our security division will be able to direct certain of its research and development spending and market its products to customers located in the european union 
as a result of these and other changes  sales of our security and inspection products have grown as compared to pre september  levels 
major international projects recently installed or currently underway include system installations in hong kong  india  jamaica  malaysia  mexico  romania  south korea and taiwan  among others 
these sites contain various cargo inspection product offerings including mobile  fixed and relocatable high energy x ray  mobile gamma ray and hybrid x ray thermo neutron analysis scanning systems 
we anticipate that there may be growing demand from governments and commercial enterprises for increasingly sophisticated solutions to screening vehicles  trucks  ocean going cargo  rail cars and air pallet containers 
healthcare 
healthcare is a rapidly growing sector throughout most of the world and especially in many asian and latin american economies 
in much of the developed world  including in the united states and europe  an aging population is also fueling growth 
many factors such as a severe nursing shortage in the united states and europe  stricter government requirements affecting the staffing and accountability and shrinking reimbursements from health insurance organizations are forcing healthcare providers to do more with less 
our healthcare division designs  manufactures and markets products that respond to these new economic forces by helping hospitals reduce costs while maintaining or improving the quality of care their physicians and nurses are able to deliver 
we are a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical networking solutions for use primarily in hospitals 
we design  manufacture and market patient monitoring solutions for critical  emergency and perioperative care areas of the hospital  wired and wireless networks  ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services  all aimed at providing caregivers with timely patient information 
by making critical patient information more readily accessible both inside and outside the hospital  delays in decision making can be reduced  length of stay can be shortened and treatment errors can be minimized 
in february  we acquired a global manufacturer and distributor of anesthesia delivery systems  ventilators and vaporizers 
we sell these products primarily to hospitals for use in operating rooms and anesthesia induction areas as well as in magnetic resonance imaging mri facilities 
in addition  as pharmaceutical companies develop new anesthesia agents for the worldwide market  or as generic alternatives to patented anesthesia formulas become available  we work closely with them to support their new product introductions 
as a result  we also sell systems and components  such as anesthesia vaporizers and ventilators  directly to pharmaceutical companies and other manufacturers of anesthesia delivery systems 
we also design  manufacture and market next generation pulse oximetry instruments and compatible pulse oximetry sensors  which are used to non invasively monitor oxygenation levels in a patient s blood 
additionally  we design  manufacture and market x ray densitometers and ultrasound scanners  which are used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow up bone density measurements 

table of contents this division has grown from approximately million in annual revenues in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of spacelabs medical and blease 
in connection with this growth  during fiscal year we formed spacelabs healthcare  inc to serve as a holding company for the spacelabs medical  blease  dolphin and osteometer business operations 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we then completed an initial public offering of approximately million previously unissued shares of spacelabs healthcare common stock  representing approximately of its total issued and outstanding shares 
the newly issued shares began trading on the alternative investment market aim  a market administered by the london stock exchange  on october  under the ticker symbol slab 
subsequent to fiscal year end  on july   spacelabs healthcare completed the acquisition of the del mar reynolds cardiac division of ferraris group plc  a company registered in england and wales 
the acquired operations develop  manufacture and market cardiac monitoring systems  including holter recorders  ecg  stress systems and related software and services to hospitals  primarily in the us  germany and the united kingdom 
del mar reynolds also operates a core laboratory business that provides clinical trial services to pharmaceutical companies and to clinical research organizations 
optoelectronics and manufacturing 
our optoelectronic devices are used in a wide variety of applications such as satellites  laser guidance systems  range finders  computer peripherals and other applications that require the conversion of optical signals into electronic signals 
because optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems can be used in a wide variety of measurement control and monitoring applications  they are also used in a broad array of industrial applications and are key components in the telecommunications and fiber optics industries 
historically  we have offered value added manufacturing services to purchasers of our optoelectronic devices  including to our security and healthcare divisions 
more recently  however  we have begun to expand such services by providing complete turn key and box build manufacturing services  in which we can design  acquire materials  produce  test and supply electronic systems and components to purchasers of optoelectronic devices and to others 
we believe that recent advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems  including computer processing power and memory  have broadened the market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications 
in addition  we see a trend among original equipment manufacturers to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic devices as well as value added subsystems to fully integrated  independent manufacturers  like us  who may have greater specialization  broader expertise and the flexibility to respond in shorter time periods than most original equipment manufacturers can accomplish in house 
we believe that our level of vertical integration  substantial engineering resources  expertise in the use and application of optoelectronic technology and low cost international manufacturing operations enable us to compete effectively in the market for optoelectronic devices and for value added manufacturing services 
we have also penetrated several related markets that depend on our optoelectronic technologies and electronics manufacturing capabilities

through system engineering  product development  rapid prototyping and volume manufacturing  we develop  manufacture and market laser based weapons simulation systems for defense and homeland security applications 
products include tactical engagement simulation systems  small arms transmitters  controller guns and a variety of targeting systems 
we also develop  manufacture and sell laser based remote sensing devices that are used to detect and classify vehicles in toll and traffic management systems 
growth strategy we believe that one of our primary competitive strengths is our expertise in the cost effective design and manufacture of specialized electronic systems and components for critical applications 
as a result we have leveraged  and intend to continue to leverage  such expertise and capacity to gain price  performance and agility 
table of contents advantages over our competitors in the security  healthcare and optoelectronics fields  and to translate such advantages into profitable growth in those fields 
at the same time  we continually seek to identify new markets in which our core expertise and capacity will provide us with competitive advantages 
key elements of this strategy include capitalizing on global reach 
we operate from locations in north america  asia and europe 
we view our international operations as providing an important strategic advantage over competitors 
first  international manufacturing facilities allow us to take advantage of competitive labor rates and favorable tax regulations in order to be a low cost producer 
second  our international offices strengthen our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to service and repair our systems by providing direct access to growing foreign markets and to our existing international customer base 
third  multiple manufacturing locations allow us to reduce delivery times to our global customer base 
in the future  we intend to develop new sources of manufacturing and sales capabilities to maintain and enhance the benefits of our international presence 
capitalizing on vertical integration 
our vertical integration provides several advantages in each of our divisions 
these advantages include reduced manufacturing and delivery times  lower costs due to our access to competitive international labor markets  direct sourcing of raw materials and quality control 
we also believe that we offer significant added value to our customers by providing a full range of vertically integrated services including component design and customization  subsystem concept design and application engineering  product prototyping and development  efficient pre production and short run and high volume manufacturing 
we believe that our vertical integration differentiates us from many of our competitors and provides value to our customers who can rely on us to be an integrated supplier 
we intend to continue to leverage our vertically integrated services to create greater value for our customers in the design and manufacture of our products 
we believe that this strategy better positions us for penetration into end markets such as the markets for security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems 
capitalizing on the growing market for security and inspection systems 
heightened attentiveness to terrorist and other security threats may continue to drive growth in the market for security and inspection systems  not only in transportation security  but in facilities security  event security and materials inspection as well 
in addition  the trend toward increased international transportation of goods may result in growth in the market for cargo inspection systems that are capable of screening shipping containers for contraband and assisting customs officials in the verification of shipping manifests 
package screening by freight forwarders also represents a potential growing sector  as new regulations in europe require such screening and awareness of the need for such screening grows in the us we intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally  and to capitalize on opportunities to replace  service and upgrade existing security installations 
we also intend to continue to develop new security and inspection technologies  such as our real time tomography products  and may enhance and expand our current product offerings through selective acquisitions to better address new applications and security industry demands 
improving and complementing existing medical technologies 
we develop and market patient monitoring systems that provide clinicians with critical  real time patient information and anesthesia delivery systems  ventilators and vaporizers that utilize patient monitoring technologies 
as a result  we are able to market and sell many of our various product offerings through shared sales channels and distribution networks 
our efforts to improve our existing medical technologies are focused on making patient information available to care providers both at the bedside as well as in other parts or even away from the hospital  thereby reducing time demands on physicians and nurses  enabling more rapid treatment decisions and improving patient care 
overall  our efforts at improving our existing medical diagnostic and anesthesia delivery technologies will also continue to concentrate on the development of devices that make it possible for institutions from large hospitals to small clinics and physicians offices to obtain accurate  precise  reliable and cost effective results 
selectively entering new markets 
we intend to continue to selectively enter new markets that complement our existing capabilities in the design  development and manufacture of specialized electronic systems and components for critical applications such as security and inspection and medical monitoring and 
table of contents anesthesia systems 
we believe that by manufacturing end products that rely on our existing technological capabilities  we will leverage our integrated design and manufacturing infrastructure to capture greater margins and to build a larger presence in new end markets that present attractive competitive dynamics 
we intend to achieve this strategy through internal growth and through selective acquisitions 
acquiring new technologies and companies 
our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
we have developed expertise in our various lines of business and other areas through internal research and development efforts as well as through selective acquisitions 
as a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems and components for critical applications  we have  since our inception as a company  looked for acquisitions opportunities to broaden our technological expertise and capabilities  lower our manufacturing costs or facilitate our entry into new markets

global branding of our divisions 
in march  we announced that the products of our security division  which had previously been sold under various brand names including ancore  eagle  metor  rapiscan  and secure  would be consolidated under one overall name rapiscan systems 
since the announcement  all of the products of the companies that comprise our security division are being marketed under the rapiscan systems umbrella 
in october  spacelabs healthcare  a recently formed subsidiary comprising the business operations of our entire healthcare division  completed an initial public offering of approximately of its total issued and outstanding common stock 
the newly issued spacelabs healthcare shares currently trade under the ticker symbol slab on the alternative investment market aim  a market administered by the london stock exchange 
since this ipo  all of the companies within the healthcare division 
table of contents operate under the spacelabs healthcare umbrella 
finally  in february we announced that our optoelectronics and manufacturing division  which had previously marketed its optoelectronic devices under various brand names including udt sensors  ame  centro vision  osi fibercomm and opto sensors  would consolidate them all under a single brand name osi optoelectronics 
we have undertaken each of these rebranding efforts  in part  in order to improve brand recognition for the broad range of complementary products and services that are offered respectively within each of our security  healthcare and optoelectronics and manufacturing divisions 
products and technology we design  develop  manufacture and sell products ranging from complex security and inspection systems to medical monitoring and anesthesia systems to discrete optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems 
security and inspection systems 
we design  manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under the rapiscan systems name 
rapiscan systems products are used to inspect baggage  cargo  people  vehicles and other objects for weapons  explosives  drugs and other contraband 
these systems are also used for the safe  accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials 
rapiscan systems products fall into four categories baggage and parcel inspection  cargo and vehicle inspection  hold checked baggage screening and people screening 
as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  and subsequent attacks in other worldwide locations  security and inspection products have increasingly been used at a wide range of facilities other than airports such as border crossings  railway stations  seaports  cruise line terminals  government and military installations and nuclear facilities 
as a result of the additional markets  we have successfully diversified sales channels for our security and inspection products 
many of our security and inspection systems in each of the baggage and parcel inspection  cargo and vehicle inspection  hold baggage screening and people screening product categories combine the use of x ray technology with our optoelectronic capabilities 
for example  some of our products include dual or multi energy x ray technology with computer software enhanced imaging technology to facilitate the detection of materials such as explosives  weapons  narcotics  currency or other contraband 
while all x ray systems produce a two dimensional image of the contents of the inspected object  the dual energy x ray systems also measure the x ray absorption of the inspected object s contents at two x ray energies to determine the atomic number  mass and other characteristics of the object s contents 
the various organic and inorganic substances in the inspected object appear to operators of the inspection systems in various colors and this visual information can be used to identify and differentiate the inspected materials 
our baggage and parcel inspection  cargo and vehicle inspection and hold baggage screening inspection systems range in size from compact tabletop systems to large systems comprising entire buildings in which trucks  shipping containers or pallets are inspected 
our cargo and vehicle inspection applications  in which trucks  shipping containers  pallets and other large objects can be inspected  are designed in various configurations  including fixed site  gantry  relocatable  portal and mobile systems 
these products are primarily used to verify the contents of trucks or cargo containers and to detect the presence of contraband 
they offer significant improvements over past methods of cargo screening  such as manual searches  as our cargo systems are faster  more thorough and do not subject the cargo to pilferage 
entire shipping containers or trucks containing densely packed goods can be screened rapidly 
many of our cargo and vehicle inspection systems utilize ionizing radiation  such as high energy x ray or gamma ray beams  in conjunction with digital imaging equipment to non intrusively inspect objects and present images to an inspector  showing shapes  sizes  locations and relative densities of the contents 
many of these systems  such as the rapiscan eagle  which was designed and developed under contract with us customs and border protection and the us department of defense  have been built to meet specific customer inspection requirements 

table of contents other cargo and vehicle inspection products automatically and non intrusively detect chemical signatures indicating the presence of explosives and other contraband through the use of pulsed fast neutron and thermal neutron technologies  as opposed to ionizing radiation 
pulsed fast neutron and thermal neutron technologies permit the operator to inspect cargo  vehicles and containers based on the distinctive chemical composition of various forms of contraband 
our pulsed fast neutron analysis technology uses a penetrating beam of fast neutrons to measure the elemental contents oxygen  nitrogen  etc 
within scanned objects cargo containers  trucks  etc 
and identify elemental signatures of explosives  drugs or other contraband 
the systems utilizing this technology then display to the system operator a three dimensional image of the scanned object  identifying the location and type of suspect material found 
our systems utilizing thermal neutron analysis technology use a similar method to detect bulk quantities of explosives and drugs concealed in trucks or cargo containers 
our security division is the only competitor in the market offering x ray  gamma ray and neutron based material specific technologies 
as a result  we believe we offer the broadest technology platform in the cargo and vehicle inspection systems industry 
this broad platform also permits us to offer customers hybrid solutions utilizing two or more of the technologies together  thereby optimizing flexibility  performance and cost to meet the customer s unique application requirements 
cargo and vehicle inspection systems recently installed or currently underway include system installations in the united states  china  hong kong  india  malaysia  mexico  romania  south korea and taiwan  among others 
our security division also offers people screening products such as a line of metor brand walk through metal detection products for use at security checkpoints at airports  amusement parts  banks  courthouses  government buildings  sports arenas and other venues 
it also offers the rapiscan secure personnel screener  which uses extremely low dose backscatter x ray imaging to detect contraband and weapons concealed underneath clothing and hair 
the rapiscan secure provides enhanced screening compared to metal detectors as it displays anomalies caused by very small amounts of metal as well as non metallic items 
as a result  the rapiscan secure can simultaneously locate and detect conventional metal weapons  as well as ceramic knives  explosives  illicit drugs  precious metals  cameras  recording devices and other contraband or security threats

table of contents medical monitoring and anesthesia systems 
our healthcare businesses design  manufacture and market their products worldwide to end users under several brand names 
we sell patient monitoring and connectivity solutions under the spacelabs medical trade name  diagnostic cardiology monitoring solutions under the del mar reynolds trade name  cardiology analysis solutions under the hertford cardiology and spacelabs medical data trade names  and anesthesia systems and components under the blease trade name 
in addition  we sell arterial hemoglobin saturation monitors and sensors  including hand held and wireless monitoring tools  under the dolphin trade name and peripheral bone densitometers and ultrasound bone densitometers under the osteometer trade name 
spacelabs medical products include ultraview sl patient monitors  which are used in perioperative  critical care and emergency ward environments 
we also offer patient monitors for virtually all applications in the hospital  including neonatal  pediatric and adult critical and emergency care  as well as anesthesia and sub acute care 
our patient monitoring systems comprise monitors and central nurse stations connected either wirelessly or through hospital networks  as well as stand alone monitors where the patient data can be transported physically from one monitor to another as the patient is moved 
this ensures that hospital staff can access patient data where and when it is required 
in addition  these products are open architecture in that they are designed to interact with hospital information systems acquired from other vendors 
windna  based on citrix thin client technology  is a feature of many of these products which allows clinicians to view and control microsoft windows applications on the patient monitor s display  eliminating the need for separate terminals in the patient s room 
attending nurses can thereby check laboratory results and other reports  enter orders  review protocols and do charting right at the patient s bedside 
inputs can be made using a mouse  keyboard and touchscreen 
for electrocardiograph monitoring or multiparameter monitoring of ambulatory patients  we offer a digital telemetry system 
the system operates between and mhz  a band not used for private land mobile radio  business radio services or broadcast analog and digital television 
spacelabs medical s ultraview digital telemetry solution comprises a lightweight and compact transmitter that enables monitoring of heart rate  st segment  arrhythmia and continuous spo pulse oximetry 
the multiparameter transmitter also integrates with the spacelabs medical ultralite ambulatory blood pressure monitor for the transmission of non invasive blood pressure values to a central station or a multi disclosure and information system 
we are also a world leader in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  which is a routine procedure in many european countries and is increasingly being used in the united states 
many physicians are using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to detect white coat hypertension  a condition in which people experience elevated blood pressure in the doctor s office  but not in their daily lives 
hypertension affects approximately million americans and is particularly prevalent in the medicare population 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is also used to adjust drug therapies for hypertensive patients 
it is estimated that as many as of the patients that are diagnosed with hypertension based on blood pressure measurements taken in their physicians offices are not actually hypertensive 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring helps improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize the associated costs of treatment 
in july  our healthcare division completed the acquisition of the del mar reynolds cardiac division of ferraris group plc  in significant part for the purpose of augmenting the division s diagnostic cardiology product offerings 
del mar reynolds has been developing cardiac monitoring systems  including holter systems and recorders  for over years 
its pathfinder and impresario lines of holter analyzers offer users interactive control with advanced diagnostic parameters 
its lifecard and aria recorders are worn by patients for up to seven days in order capture heart arrhythmias that may occur in a patient only a few times per week 
patients that may be experiencing even less frequent heart arrhythmias wear its cardiocall product  which stays with the patient over several weeks and transmits its findings over the phone to a receiving station in the hospital 
in addition to these products  del mar reynolds also offers other diagnostic cardiology products such as the voyager electrocardiogram series  cardiodirect and ch stress test systems 

table of contents our blease group designs and manufactures anesthesia delivery systems  anesthesia vaporizers and ventilators 
its focus  genius and sirius anesthesia delivery systems provide flexible anesthesia solutions for most operating room environments  anesthesia induction areas  day surgery units  maternity suites  magnetic resonance imaging facilities and other areas where the administration of anesthesia is required 
its datum anesthesia vaporizers and its line of anesthesia ventilators are also designed to be compatible with the anesthesia delivery systems of several other manufacturers 
at the forefront in anesthesia ventilation  blease recognized the needs of clinicians and the clinical benefits of allowing patients to breathe without the assistance of a ventilator ie  on their own as much as possible while undergoing anesthesia 
as a result  in blease became the first company to offer ventilators that allowed patients to breathe spontaneously while under anesthesia with the respiratory support of the ventilator used only when necessary to overcome the effects of general anesthesia 
in addition  by incorporating spirometry loops into its ventilators  which produce graphical displays about the adequacy and state of a patient s ventilation  clinicians were able to carefully monitor their patients and ensure the efficacy of the mode of ventilation provided 
in august  blease announced that it had added seven new ventilators to its existing product line  each of which enables clinicians to enhance control over the delivery of ventilation and more finely tune their requirements to a surgical procedure and the individual characteristics of a patient by actively controlling flow into and out of the ventilation drive system  throughout the entire respiratory cycle 
in addition  each of these new ventilators works in conjunction with a large inch touch screen display  available in either monochrome or color format 
this screen  in conjunction with blease s proprietary touch and trak user interface is easy to use  allowing clinicians to focus greater attention on other aspects of patient care 
our healthcare division also manufactures and distributes the dtx and dexacare g dual energy x ray forearm densitometers

optoelectronic devices generally consist of both active and passive components 
active components sense light of varying wavelengths and convert the light detected into electronic signals  whereas passive components amplify  separate or reflect light 
the active components we manufacture consist of silicon  gallium arsenide and indium gallium arsenide photodetectors 
passive components include lenses  prisms  filters  mirrors and other precision optical products that are used by us in the manufacture of our optoelectronic products or are sold to others for use in telescopes  laser printers  copiers  microscopes and other detection and vision equipment 
the devices we manufacture are both standard products and products customized for specific applications and are offered either as components or as subsystems 
we have recently developed two dimensional back illuminated detector technology for security  healthcare and industrial computed tomography ct applications 
this technology overcomes the limitations of conventional detectors by providing finer detector pitch density 
this is used in high resolution multi slice ct scanners and other applications requiring improved image resolution 

table of contents in addition to the manufacture of standard and original equipment manufacturer products  we also specialize in designing and manufacturing customized value added subsystems for use in a wide range of products and equipment 
an optoelectronic subsystem typically consists of one or more optoelectronic devices that are combined with other electronic components and packaging for use in an end product 
the composition of a subsystem can range from a simple assembly of various optoelectronic devices that are incorporated into other subsystems for example  a printed circuit board containing our optoelectronic devices to complete end products for example  pulse oximetry equipment 
furthermore  we have expanded our electronics design and manufacturing capabilities with enhanced box build manufacturing services and pc board assembly capabilities utilizing state of the art automated surface mount technology lines 
as a result  we now offer electronics manufacturing services for data and signal processing  amplifier and processor boards for medical equipment  musical tuning and studio hardware  motor controls  power supplies  and several other industrial applications that do not utilize optoelectronic devices

we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts in the future 

table of contents manufacturing and materials we currently manufacture our security and inspection systems in hawthorne  santa clara and sunnyvale  california and ocean springs  mississippi  and internationally in india  finland  malaysia and the united kingdom 
we currently manufacture our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems in hawthorne  california and issaquah  washington  and internationally in india  malaysia  singapore and the united kingdom 
we currently manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems in camarillo  hawthorne and newbury park california  north andover  massachusetts and ocean springs  mississippi  and internationally in india  malaysia and norway 
most of our high volume  labor intensive manufacturing and assembly is performed at our facility in malaysia 
since most of our customers currently are located in the united states  europe and asia  our ability to assemble products in these markets and provide follow on service from offices located in these regions is an important component of our global strategy 
our global manufacturing organization has expertise in optoelectronic  microelectronic and integrated value added assemblies for commercial  medical  aerospace and defense industry applications 
our manufacturing includes silicon wafer processing and fabrication  optoelectronic device assembly and screening  thin and thick film microelectronic hybrid assemblies  surface mounted and thru hole printed circuit board electronic assemblies and value added services including complete turn key and box build manufacturing 
we outsource certain manufacturing operations  including certain sheet metal fabrication and plastic components 
the manufacturing process for components and subsystems consists of manual tasks performed by skilled technicians as well as automated tasks 
the principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our security and inspection systems consist primarily of x ray generators  linear accelerators  detectors  data acquisition and computing devices  conveyor systems and video monitors 
a large portion of the optoelectronic devices  subsystems and circuit card assemblies used in our inspection and detection systems are manufactured in house 
the x ray generators and certain metal enclosures used in our baggage and parcel inspection systems are also manufactured in house  while the x ray generators and linear accelerators used in our cargo and vehicle inspection systems are purchased from unaffiliated third party providers 
we purchase the x ray tubes  computer hardware and certain standard mechanical parts and some of our metal enclosures from unaffiliated third party providers 
the principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems consist of printed circuit boards  housings  mechanical assemblies  pneumatic devices  cables  filters and packaging materials 
we purchase certain devices  including computers  peripheral accessories and remote displays from unaffiliated third party providers 
the principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems consist of silicon wafers  ceramics  electronic subcomponents  light emitting diodes  scintillation crystals  passive optical components  printed circuit boards  headers and caps  housings  cables  filters and packaging materials 
the silicon based optoelectronic devices manufactured by us are critical components in most of our subsystems 
since  we have purchased substantially all of the silicon wafers we use to manufacture our optoelectronic devices from siltronic corp 
for cost  quality control and efficiency reasons  we generally purchase raw materials and subcomponents only from single vendors with whom we have ongoing relationships 
we do  however  qualify second sources for most of our raw materials and critical components  or have identified alternate sources of supply 
we purchase the materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
although to date none of our divisions has experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of its raw materials or subcomponents  it is possible that they may face such shortages or delays in one or more materials in the future 

table of contents patents  trademarks  tradenames and licenses trademarks and tradenames 
we have used  registered and applied to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the united states and in foreign countries 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the united states and abroad 
patents 
we hold a number of us and foreign patents relating to various aspects of our security and inspection products  medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and optoelectronic devices and subsystems 
our current patents will expire at various times between and however  it remains possible that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed may not result in issued patents 
in addition  issued patents may not survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  may not be able to provide meaningful protection from competition 
licenses 
our security  healthcare and optoelectronics and manufacturing divisions have each entered into a variety of license arrangements under which they are permitted to manufacture  market  sell and or service various types of software  data  equipment  components and enhancements to our own proprietary technology 
we believe that our trademarks and tradenames  patents and licenses are important to our business 
the loss of some of our trademarks  patents or licenses might have a negative impact on our financial results and operations  however  we operate in a competitive environment with a known customer base and rely mainly on providing our customers with quality products and services to ensure continuing business 
thus  with the exception of the loss of either the spacelabs or rapiscan trademarks  the impact of the loss of any single trademark  patent or license would not likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
we consider the spacelabs trademark an important asset and have registered it in approximately forty countries 
in addition  following the recent re branding of our security division under the rapiscan systems name  we have instituted a similar registration program for the rapiscan trademark 
regulation of medical products the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous federal government agencies  principally the us food and drug administration fda  and by certain state and foreign authorities 
they are also subject to various us and foreign electrical safety standards 
the fda has broad regulatory powers with respect to pre clinical and clinical testing of new medical products and the manufacturing  marketing and advertising of medical products 
it requires that all medical devices introduced into the market be preceded either by a pre market notification clearance order under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act  or an approved pre market approval application 
a k pre market notification clearance order indicates that the fda agrees with an applicant s determination that the product for which clearance has been sought is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device 
the clearance of a pre market approval application  on the other hand  indicates that the fda has determined that the device has been proven  through the submission of clinical trial data and manufacturing quality assurance information  to be safe and effective for its labeled indications 
the process of obtaining k clearance typically takes between three and six months  but can take substantially longer 
the pre market approval application review process  on the other hand  can last more than a year 
to date  all of the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems we manufacture and sell in the united states have required only k pre market notification clearance 
such regulatory approvals  when granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed  and such product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
manufacturers of fda regulated products are subject to pervasive and continuing governmental regulation  including extensive recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with 
table of contents product manufacture and use 
compliance with these requirements is costly  and failure to comply can result in  among other things  fines  total or partial suspension of production  product recalls  failure of the fda to review pending marketing clearances or approval applications  withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals or even criminal prosecution 
we are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture and market our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems 
for example  the commercialization of medical devices in the european union is regulated under a system that presently requires all medical devices sold in the european union to bear the ce mark an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards 
our manufacturing facilities in hawthorne and irvine  california  issaquah  washington  and in chesham and hertford in the united kingdom are all certified to the international organization for standardization s iso standard for medical device companies 
they are also certified to the requirements of the european medical device directive eec  which allows them to self certify that newly manufactured products can bear the ce mark 
we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our medical monitoring and anesthesia delivery systems 
such regulations and their enforcement do  however  constantly change  and we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes may have on our businesses in the future 
environmental regulations we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
under such laws  we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances that have been released on or in our facilities or that have been disposed of off site as waste 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances 
we have conducted phase i environmental site assessments for each of our properties in the united states at which we manufacture products 
the purpose of each such report is to identify  as of the date of such report  potential areas of environmental concern related to past and present activities or from nearby operations 
in certain cases  we have conducted further environmental assessments consisting of soil and groundwater testing and other investigations deemed appropriate by independent environmental consultants 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations  and that we have obtained all material environmental permits necessary to conduct our business 
the amount of hazardous substances and wastes produced and generated by us may increase in the future depending on changes in our operations 
any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing process or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during one such investigation  we discovered soil and groundwater contamination at our hawthorne  california facility 
we filed the requisite reports concerning this problem with the appropriate environmental authorities in fiscal year we have not yet received any response to such reports  and no agency action or litigation is presently pending or threatened 
we also have notified the prior owners of the facility and the present owners and tenants of adjacent properties concerning the problem and have requested from such parties agreements to toll of the statute of limitations with respect to actions against such parties with respect to the contamination in order that we may focus our attention on resolution of the contamination problem 
our site was previously used by other companies for semiconductor manufacturing similar to that presently conducted on the site by us  and it is not presently known who is responsible for the contamination or  if required  the remediation 
the groundwater contamination is a known regional problem  not limited to our premises or our immediate surroundings 
we have also been informed of soil and groundwater evaluation efforts at a facility that our ferson technologies subsidiary previously leased in ocean springs  mississippi 
ferson technologies occupied the 
table of contents facility between and we believe that the owner and previous occupants of the facility have primary responsibility for any remediation that may be required and have an agreement with the facility s owner under which the owner is responsible for remediation of pre existing conditions 
however  as site evaluation efforts are still in progress  and may be for some time  we are unable at this time to ascertain whether ferson technologies bears any exposure for remediation costs under applicable environmental regulations 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change 
we compete with a number of other manufacturers  some of which have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  have stronger customer relationships  have greater name recognition and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
as a result  we may not be able to compete successfully against designers and manufacturers of specialized electronic systems and components  broadly speaking  or more specifically within the markets for security and inspection systems  medical monitoring and anesthesia systems  or optoelectronic devices 
future competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
in the security and inspection market  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and quality  the overall cost effectiveness of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the products  price  local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization 
we believe that our principal competitors in the market for security and inspection products are the security and detection systems division of l communications corporation  the smiths detection division of smiths group plc  american science and engineering  inc  ge infrastructure  security  a division of the general electric company  science applications international corporation  control screening llc  ceia spa  garrett electronics  inc and nuctech company limited 
competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
in the airline and airport security and inspection market  particularly in the upgrade and replacement market  we also compete for potential customers based on existing relationships between our competitors and the customers 
certain of our competitors established strong relationships with airlines  airports and other transportation security authorities 
we believe that the image quality and resolution of certain of our security and inspection products is superior to the image quality offered by many of our competitors x ray based inspection products 
additionally  our true multi zone metal detection technology provides the ability to detect small metallic objects and offer higher levels of discrimination in weapons screening applications 
although we also have established relationships with a number of airport and airline customers  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with existing competitors or new entrants 
in the cargo and vehicle inspection systems market  we compete for potential customers based on price  performance and the ability to design both standard and customized products 
several of our competitors have operated in this area for longer than we have 
however  due to our recent successes in designing and delivering high energy x ray systems  we believe we have demonstrated our ability to compete effectively 
additionally  although our competitors in the cargo and vehicle inspection market each offer products in competition with one or more of our products  our ability to supply high energy x ray  gamma ray and thermal neutron analysis systems means that we offer among the widest array of solutions available from a single supplier 
this variety of technologies also permits us to offer unique hybrid systems to our customers that utilize two or more of these technologies  thereby optimizing flexibility  performance and cost to meet the customer s unique application requirements 
in the medical monitoring and anesthesia delivery market  competition is also based on a variety of factors including product performance  functionality  value and breadth of sales and service organization 
we believe that our principal competitors in the market for medical monitoring and anesthesia systems are cardiac science corporation  criticare systems  inc  mortara instrument  philips medical systems  ge healthcare  dr ger medical  datascope corp  nihon kohden corporation  penlon limited  nellcor  a division of tyco healthcare 
table of contents and schiller 
competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of our market share 
we believe that our patient monitoring products are easier to use than the products of many of our competitors because we offer a consistent user interface throughout many of our product lines 
in addition to this advantage  the monitoring products of our spacelabs medical subsidiary are backward forward compatible  meaning that new spacelabs medical monitors can interface with existing spacelabs medical monitor models  thus offering investment protection to our customers 
finally  while some of our competitors are also beginning to introduce portal technology  which allows remote access to data from the bedside monitor  central station or other point of care  we believe that our competing technologies are superior in bringing instant access to labs  radiology and charting at the point of care 
although we have established relationships with a number of large hospitals  we may not be able to successfully compete in the future with existing competitors or with new entrants 
in the optoelectronic devices and subsystems market  competition for optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems is based primarily on such factors as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through production 
we believe that our major competitors in the optoelectronic device market are perkinelmer  inc and hamamatsu corporation 
because we specialize in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise  we believe that we generally do not compete to any significant degree with any other large united states  european or asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components 
competition in the extensive electronic manufacturing services market ranges from multinational corporations with sales in excess of several billions of dollars  to large regional competitors and to small local assembly companies 
in our experience  the original equipment manufacturers to whom we provide such services prefer to engage companies that offer both local and lower cost off shore facilities 
as a result  our primary competition for these services is located in southern california and in new england  where our us facilities are also located 
such competition includes cts  sigmatron international  sanmina sci  senior systems technology  and benchmark electronics  among others 
backlog we measure our backlog as orders for which purchase orders or contracts have been signed  but which have not yet been shipped and for which revenues have not yet been recognized 
we typically ship our security and inspection systems  medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems within one to several months after receiving an order 
however  such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons including any special design or engineering requirements of the customer 
in addition  large orders of security and inspection products more than ten machines typically require more lead time 
cargo and vehicle inspection systems may require several months to several years lead time 
we have experienced some significant shipping delays associated with our cargo and vehicle inspection systems 
such delays can occur for many reasons  including i additional time necessary to conduct inspections at the factory before shipment  ii a customer s need to engage in time consuming special site preparation to accommodate the system  over which we have no control or responsibility  iii additional fine tuning of such systems once they are installed  iv design or specification changes by the customer  and v delays originating from other contractors on the project 
as of june   our consolidated backlog totaled approximately million  compared to approximately million as of june  and approximately million at june  we expect to ship most of our backlog as of june  during fiscal year sales orders underlying our backlog are firm orders 
however  from time to time  we may agree to permit the cancellation of an order on a negotiated basis 
variations in the size of orders  product mix  or delivery requirements  among other factors  may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period 
backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period and cannot be considered a meaningful indicator of our performance on an annual or quarterly basis 

table of contents employees as of june   we employed approximately  people  of whom  were employed in manufacturing  were employed in engineering or research and development  were employed in finance and administration  were employed in sales and marketing and were employed in service capacities 
of the total employees  approximately  were employed in north america and south america  were employed in asia and were employed in europe 
our advanced microelectronics as subsidiary in norway has employees and our rapiscan systems oy subsidiary in finland has eight employees who are union members and have collective bargaining rights 
none of our other employees are unionized 
we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike  and management believes that its relations with employees are good

risk factors fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results 
factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  low or fluctuating levels of political stability in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations by our competitors  variations in our product mix  
table of contents the timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales  exchange rate fluctuations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  changes in the volume or timing of product orders  timing of completion of acceptance testing of some of our products  natural disasters  and changes in general economic factors 
we face aggressive competition in many areas of business 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
in the security and inspection and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems markets  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and quality  cost  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization 
in the optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing markets competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines or service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines or service offerings 
the september  terrorist attacks and the creation of the us department of homeland security have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
the september  terrorist attacks and the subsequent creation of the us department of homeland security have created increased interest in our security and inspection systems  however  we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as it is now 
we do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the us department of homeland security as a result of the terrorism and whether our products will be a part of the solution 
additionally  should our products be considered as a part of the future security solution  it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products may be made available 
these factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results 
if operators of our security and inspection systems fail to detect weapons  explosives or other devises that are used to commit a terrorist act  we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development  manufacturing  sale and service of security inspection systems 
our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes 
some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag  parcel  container or other vessel 
others signal to the operator that further investigation is required 
in either case  the training  reliability and competence of the customer s operator is crucial to the detection of suspicious items 
furthermore  security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application specific 
in addition  our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances 
we test the reliability of 
table of contents our security and inspection systems during both their development and manufacturing phases 
we also perform such tests if we are requested to perform installation  warranty or post warranty servicing 
however  our security inspection systems are advanced mechanical and electronic devices and therefore can malfunction 
in addition  there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur 
the september  and world trade center bombing attacks  and the potential for future attacks  have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain 
it is very likely that  should we be found liable following a major act of terrorism  the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems could give rise to product liability claims that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the development  manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims and  sometimes  product failure claims 
we face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death 
substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry 
some of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems businesses have  in the past  been subject to product liability claims and or product recalls 
to date  no such claim or recall has had a significant impact on our operations 
future product liability claims may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
consequently  a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities  or in excess of insured liabilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems  which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles 
sales of security and inspection systems often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports  border crossing inspection sites  seaport inspection sites and other security installations 
sales outside of the united states of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities 
accordingly  a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems and our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that typically accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if we fail to receive an order after expending such resources  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards and customer needs 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

table of contents some of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues 
interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability 
we purchase certain raw materials and subcomponents from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
purchase order terms range from three months to one year at fixed costs  but we do not have guaranteed long term supply arrangements with our suppliers 
any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy  integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  working capital and financial resources 
we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  through either public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
our acquisition and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business 
we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products and technologies  either through acquisitions  investments or alliances 
acquisition and alliance activities often involve risks  including i difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  ii difficulty in managing product co development activities with our alliance partners  iii difficulty in retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  iv disruption of our ongoing business  v inability to successfully integrate the acquired technologies and operations into our businesses and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and vi lacking the experience necessary to enter into new product or technology markets successfully 
in addition  from time to time  our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future 
reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all  and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations 

table of contents economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
in fiscal year  revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues  in fiscal year and in fiscal year of the revenues generated during fiscal year from shipments made to customers outside of the united states  represented sales made by subsidiaries based in united states to foreign customers  and the balance represented sales generated by foreign subsidiaries 
since we sell certain of our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  and therefore employees  suppliers  real property  capital equipment  cash and other assets are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing legal and court systems  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against us could be costly and prevent us from making or selling certain products 
third parties may seek to claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights 
under either circumstance  we may incur significant expenses 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making  using or selling our products in the us or abroad 
our competitors may seek to challenge the intellectual property rights on which some of our new and more promising products are based 
as we introduce any new and potentially promising product  companies possessing competing technologies may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to delay or diminish potential sales and challenge our right to market such product 
lengthy and costly litigation may be necessary in order to defend against these claims 
our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
we are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually key to our current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans 
in particular  we are dependent upon the services of deepak chopra  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
we have entered into a year employment agreement 
table of contents with mr 
chopra  which expires july  and we maintain a million policy of key man life insurance on the life of mr 
chopra 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  ultimately  we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans 
in addition  we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
substantial government regulation in the united states and abroad may restrict our ability to sell our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems 
the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems  including related development activities and manufacturing processes 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as the manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for such products 
we are required to obtain clearance before we can market and sell medical devices  satisfy content requirements applicable to our labeling  sales and promotional materials  comply with manufacturing and reporting requirements  and undergo rigorous inspections 
our future products may not obtain fda clearance on a timely basis  or at all 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems must also comply with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture and market such products 
in general  the extent and complexity of medical device regulation is increasing worldwide 
this trend is likely to continue and the cost and time required to obtain marketing clearance in any given country may increase as a result 
our products may not obtain any necessary foreign clearances on a timely basis  or at all 
once any of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems is cleared for sale  regulatory authorities may still limit the use of such product  prevent its sale or manufacture or require a recall or withdrawal of such product from the marketplace 
following initial clearance from regulatory authorities  we continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
government authorities can withdraw marketing clearance due to our failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance 
ongoing regulatory requirements are wide ranging and govern  among other things annual inspections to retain ce mark for sale of products in the european union  product manufacturing  supplier substitution  product changes  process modifications  medical device reporting  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force us to modify our manufacturing processes 
we are subject to various foreign and us federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
under such laws  we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of 
table of contents offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in our facilities 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to these controls 
as directed by the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include in their annual reports an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting  as well as the operating effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
we evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
we expect to continue to expend significant resources in complying with the documentation and testing procedures required by the sarbanes oxley act of however  there will remain an ongoing risk that we will not comply with all of its requirements 
if our independent registered public accounting firm differs from us in its interpretation of the requirements imposed on us by the sarbanes oxley act of  or if it is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or with the level at which such controls are documented  operated or reviewed  we may be delayed in filing reports with the securities and exchange commission  our independent registered public accounting firm may decline to attest to our management s assessment or it may issue a qualified report 
in addition  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls over financial reporting in connection with its audit of our financial statements and if it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures  it is possible that we could receive a qualified or adverse audit opinion in connection with those financial statements 
accordingly  we may not receive a favorable report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or if we receive an adverse report from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting  investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and the market for our common stock could be adversely affected 
our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the listing in the united kingdom of common stock of spacelabs healthcare 
in october  we announced the initial public offering in the united kingdom of million previously unissued shares of common stock representing approximately of its total issued and outstanding shares of spacelabs healthcare  a newly formed subsidiary composed of the business operations of our healthcare division 
these shares currently trade under the ticker symbol slab on the alternative investment market aim  a market administered by the london stock exchange 
the value of these shares  and consequently the value of the shares in spacelabs healthcare that we retained following the placing  is subject to stock price fluctuations as well as fluctuations in the british pound  the currency in which the shares trade 
a downturn in the performance of equity markets in the united kingdom generally  or on the aim specifically  could depress the value of the spacelabs healthcare shares that we own 

table of contents we receive significant amounts of research and development funding for our security and inspection systems from government grants and contracts 
we may not continue to receive comparable levels of funding for future product development 
the us government currently plays an important role in funding the development of certain of our security and inspection systems and sponsoring their deployment at airports  ports and border crossings 
however  in the future  additional research and development funds from the government may not be available to us 
if the government fails to continue to sponsor our technologies we may have to expend more resources on product development or cease development of certain technologies  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  any future grants to our competitors may improve their ability to develop and market competing products and cause our customers to delay purchase decisions  which could harm our ability to market our products 
our articles of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by shareholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock and may limit the ability of such shareholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have in place a stockholder rights plan  adopted in  under which our shareholders are entitled to purchase shares of preferred stock under certain circumstances 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of our company that could be beneficial to the shareholders 
our articles of incorporation limit the liability of its directors  which may limit the remedies we or our shareholders have available 
our articles of incorporation provide that  pursuant to the california corporations code  the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under california law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us  or in our right  for breach of a director s duties to us or our shareholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our shareholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply to liabilities for i acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of our company or our shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  iii any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit  iv acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the our company or our shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware  or should have been aware  in the ordinary course of performing a director s duties  of a risk of serious injury to our company or our shareholders  v acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to our company or our shareholders  vi certain transactions or the approval of transactions in which a director has a material financial interest  and vii expressly imposed by statute for approval of certain improper distributions to shareholders or certain loans or guarantees

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
as a result  actual results may differ from such estimates 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products when title and risk of loss passes  and when terms are fixed and collection is probable 
in accordance with the terms of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  where installation services  if provided  are essential to the functionality of the equipment  we defer the portion of revenue for the sale attributable to installation until we have completed the installation 
when terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  we defer revenue until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves and warranty expenses 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of the revenue we recognize 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 

table of contents we undertake projects that include the design  development and manufacture or fabrication of large  complex cargo and vehicle inspection systems that are specially customized to our customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
we record sales under such contracts under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we record costs and estimated revenues as we perform work based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs  utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if our current contract estimate indicates a loss  we make provision for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project 
we recognize revenues from separate service maintenance contracts ratably over the term of the agreements 
for other services  we recognize service revenues as we perform the services 
deferred revenue for services arises from advance payments received from customers for services not yet performed 
we record billed shipping and handling fees as revenue and the associated costs as cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimates based on management s judgment  review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts 
we adjust customer credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands  market conditions and customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs could be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of past and current evidence  including  among other things  historical earnings  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which we make these determinations 
if we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  then we make an adjustment to our deferred tax assets to increase net income in the period that we make this determination 
likewise  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  then we establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and reduce net income in the period that we make this determination 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if events occur or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
this assessment requires that we determine the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units on the income approach which requires that we use estimates of future revenues  cash flows and capital expenditures  as well as market trends and growth 
we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
stock based compensation expense 
effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective approach and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this approach  
table of contents awards that are granted  modified or settled after july  have been and will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested awards that were granted prior to july  will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  except that compensation cost will be recognized in our results of operations 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas r  we record stock based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and chose to adopt the disclosure only provisions of sfas  as amended by sfas under this approach  we disclosed the cost of stock option grants and discounts offered under our employee stock purchase plan based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants  but did not charge it to expense 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing stock based compensation cost over their requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period 
in addition  sfas r requires us to estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock based compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates differ materially from our estimates  stock based compensation expense could differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded in the current period 
we periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates  as necessary 
we recognize the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision 
as a result  if we revise our assumptions and estimates  our stock based compensation expense could change materially in the future
