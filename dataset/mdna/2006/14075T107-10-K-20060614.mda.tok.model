item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pursuant to our products agreement with sun global  we have selected  through march   all products out of the products to be transferred to us by sun global 
of these  twenty products passed their bio equivalency studies as of march   and one since then 
sun global has thereby earned  preferred shares for each such product 
see sun pharmaceutical industries limited and part ii item future outlook 
we filed ten andas with the fda during fiscal this brings our total number of andas pending approval by the fda to overview of the generic drug industry we believe that sales of generic pharmaceuticals have increased in recent years because of a number of factors including i increased number of formerly patented drugs which have become available to generic competition  ii changes in governmental and third party payor health care reimbursement policies to encourage cost containment  iii increased acceptance of generic drugs by physicians  pharmacists and consumers  iv modification of state and federal laws to permit or require substitution of generic drugs by pharmacists  and v enactment of anda procedures for obtaining fda approval to manufacture generic prescription drugs 
the generic pharmaceutical business is highly competitive 
although generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  they could potentially be sold at prices that reflect a discount up to in some cases even more than the price of their branded counterparts 
the discount is relevant to the amount of competitors on any given product 
companies aspiring to earn higher margins for generic drugs may have a strategy of manufacturing niche products or hard to replicate products or could include a litigious strategy of patent challenges and first to file 
the developer of a generic product that is the first to have its anda accepted for filing by the fda and whose filing includes a paragraph iv certification that the patent on the brand name drug is invalid  unenforceable and or not infringed may be eligible to receive a day period of generic market exclusivity 
during that day period  the exclusive generic product would tend to earn higher margins on a higher volume of sales than in a situation in which other generic competition was also present 
recently this strategy has also seen reduced margins as authorized generics have become more prevalent 
authorized generics occur when the brand innovator has licensed its brand product to a generic manufacturer or has chosen to produce another label and provide the brand drug generically at typical generic discounts 
products that are difficult to develop requiring difficult to source raw materials or representing smaller therapeutic niche markets  are generally marketed by fewer companies and may also offer margins that are higher than those where barriers to entry do not exist 
caraco s products and product strategy our present product portfolio includes prescription products in strengths in package sizes 
the products and their use for the indications are set forth in the table below generic name purpose metroprolol tartrate hyper tension paromomycin sulfate antibacterial salsalate decongestant choline magnesium trisalicylate arthritis nsaid clonazepam seizure  panic disorders flurbiprofen arthritis nsaid carbamazepine chewable anti convulsant carbamazepine ir anti convulsant oxaprozin rheumatoid disease metformin hydrochloride diabetes tramadol hydrochloride opiate agonist analgesic tramadol hydrochloride with acetominophen opiate agonist analgesic meperidine hydrochloride analgesic ticlopidine reduction of incidence of strokes tizanidine management of muscle tone associated with spasticity digoxin heart failure mirtazapine anti depressant citalopram hbr anti depressant clozapine anti psychotic midrin vascular migraine headache suppressant fluvoxamine anti depressant expected to be marketed sometime in fiscal product marketed on behalf of sun pharmaceutical industries inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of sun pharma  in one strength and one pack size 
we have submitted andas to the fda for approval as of march   including filed during fiscal of these andas filed  the fda has approved through march  accordingly  we have pending andas 
our strategy has been to analyze the marketplace and try to determine opportunities for products having good market potential  that are difficult to develop  that require difficult to source raw materials and or products representing smaller therapeutic niche markets 
recently  we have started to develop products  which have potential patent litigation  and or first to file opportunities 
we anticipate also seeking opportunities to in license authorized generics and other generic pharmaceuticals 
sun pharmaceutical industries limited pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  sun pharma made an initial investment of million for the purchase of million common shares of caraco in sun pharma and its affiliates had loaned us approximately million since august 
as of december  we had repaid all of such loans 
sun pharma also assisted us  by acting as guarantor  in obtaining line of credit loans from icici bank limited  the bank of nova scotia and citibank fsb in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  all of which have been terminated as of december  in august  we entered into an agreement  whereby sun pharma was required to transfer to us the technology formula for generic pharmaceutical products over a period of five years through august we exchanged  shares of our common stock for each technology transfer of an anda product when bio equivalency studies were successfully completed and  shares for each technology transfer of a desi product 
the products provided to us from sun pharma were selected by mutual agreement 
under such agreement  we conducted  at our expense  all tests including bio equivalency studies 
pursuant to such agreement  sun pharma delivered to us the technology for products 
this agreement has expired and as noted below  we have entered into a new agreement  with sun global  an affiliate of sun pharma 
on november   we entered into a products agreement with sun global 
under the agreement  which was approved by our independent directors  sun global agreed to provide us with new generic drugs over a five year period 
our rights to the products are limited to the united states and its territories or possessions  including puerto rico 
sun global retains rights to the products in all other territories 
the products are selected by mutual agreement 
under such agreement  we conduct  at our expense  all tests including bio equivalency studies 
we are also obligated to market the products consistent with our customary practices and to provide marketing personnel 
in return for the technology transfer  sun global receives  shares of series b preferred stock for each generic drug transferred when such drug has passed its bio equivalency studies 
the preferred shares are non voting  do not receive dividends and are convertible into common shares after three years or immediately upon a change in control on a one to one basis 
the preferred shares have a liquidation preference equal to the value attributed to them on the dates on which they were earned 
while such preferred shares are outstanding  we cannot  without the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the preferred stock  amend or repeal our articles of incorporation or bylaws if such action would adversely affect the rights of the preferred stock 
in addition  without such consent  we cannot authorize the issuance of any capital stock having any preference or priority superior to the preferred stock 
the products agreement was amended by the independent committee  comprised of the three independent directors  in the first quarter of to eliminate the provision requiring that the independent committee concur in the selection of each product  and provides instead  that each product satisfy certain objective criteria developed by management and approved by the independent committee 
pursuant to such objective criteria  we have selected all the products  twenty of which passed bio equivalency studies as of march   and one since then 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future outlook 
sun pharma has established research and development centers in mumbai and vadodara  india  where the development work for products is performed 
sun pharma and its subsidiaries supply us with certain raw materials and formulations 
in addition  sun pharma assists us in acquiring machinery and equipment to enhance our production capacities 
during fiscal  we purchased approximately million in raw materials and formulations from sun pharma and its subsidiaries  as compared to million during the transition period and million during calendar we acquired million worth of machinery and equipment from sun pharma as compared to million during the transition period and million during calendar such machinery and equipment are sold to us at their cost 
sun pharma also assists us by sending qualified technical professionals who work as caraco employees 
sun pharma and its affiliates are using caraco as a contract manufacturer and or distributor for two of their products pursuant to agreements entered into in december and in january  of which only one is being marketed 
during the transition period  sparc bioresearch private limited sparc  an affiliate of sun pharma  performed certain analytical studies required as part of the bio equivalency process for two products 
the corporation incurred approximately  of costs during the period for the studies performed by sparc 
no similar studies were performed by sparc during fiscal or during the years ended december  and during the first quarter of  sun pharma acquired  additional shares of common stock and  stock options from two former directors and a significant shareholder 
sun exercised these stock options during the fourth quarter of sun pharma s current beneficial ownership is including its convertible series b preferred stock 
marketing we believe the primary factors driving competition in the generic pharmaceutical industry are price  product development  timely fda approval  manufacturing capabilities  product quality  customer service and reputation 
caraco competes effectively with respect to each of these factors  however  price is a key competitive factor in the generic pharmaceutical business 
to compete effectively on the basis of price and remain profitable  a generic drug manufacturer must manufacture its products in a cost effective manner 
in addition  we must maintain an adequate level of inventories to meet customer demands in a timely manner 
our products are effectively marketed among all classes of customers  including wholesalers  buying groups  managed care organizations  chain retail pharmacies  independent retail pharmacies  hospitals  etc 
increased competition  the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies  the continued growth of managed care organizations and consolidation among wholesalers  has resulted in higher discounts on pharmaceutical products 
as the influence of these entities continues to grow  the company will continue to face pricing pressure on our portfolio of products 
our marketing objective is to compete effectively  encourage long term relationships  and supply contracts  increase our market share on products that have not matured  gain market share on new products that are to be launched  and continue to expand our customer base 
sales and customers our sales team effectively addressed the challenges in fiscal of price erosion  increase market share on certain products that had room for improvement  improved the balance of sales to the trade classes we service  increased sales with a limited number of approvals  executed our plan well and improved on our capacity constraints  improved inventory levels and geared up to meet the challenges inherent in the generic industry in fiscal every functional area has been fortified to meet the demand of our continued growth 
certain of our end use customers purchase our products through designated wholesalers  such as amerisource bergen corporation  mckesson corporation and or cardinal health  who act as intermediary distribution channels for our products 
for example  the veterans administration  which has entered into the sales contract as discussed below  has selected mckesson as its designated wholesaler 
accordingly  shipments to three large wholesale customers  namely mckesson corporation and  amerisource bergen corporation and and cardinal health and  accounted for approximately and of gross sales for fiscal and the fiscal  respectively 
balances due from these customers represented approximately and of gross accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
no other single customer represented more than of our gross sales during fiscal and fiscal we have entered into a sales contract on june  with the veterans administration  an agency of the us government 
our agreement with this customer commenced on august  for a one year period  with four year option periods thereafter  and is for the purchase of one product  metformin hydrochloride 
the first three option periods were exercised 
the agreement may be terminated by the purchaser without cause and in such case  we would only be entitled to a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination  plus reasonable charges that have resulted from the termination 
the agreement provides that certain penalties would be incurred if we are unable to meet our sales commitment 
seasonality the company s business  taken as a whole  is not materially affected by seasonal factors 
research and development the development of new prescription anda products  including formulation  stability testing and the fda approval process  averages from two to five years 
a drug is bioequivalent to a brand name drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug are not significantly different from those of the brand name drug 
although we perform our own stability testing  bioequivalence is done through independent testing laboratories 
the company s research and development consists principally in conducting market research and patent research on brand name pharmaceuticals and generic pharmaceuticals in order to determine which products we may want to develop 
a majority of our research and development is provided by sun global as a result of our technology transfer agreement and a portion is being done by caraco 
our development list consists of both near term launches and launches that we intend to market several years in the future 
we incurred total r d expense for fiscal  fiscal and calendar as set forth below fiscal million fiscal unaudited million calendar million the non cash r d expense for the fiscal  fiscal and calendar are set forth below fiscal million fiscal unaudited million calendar million the non cash technology transfer charges are for research and product development provided by sun global 
the charges are based on the fair value of the preferred shares on the date the respective product formula passes the bio equivalency studies 
the fair value of such shares is based upon an independent valuation 
regulation the research and development  manufacture and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by other federal  state and local entities  which regulate  among other things  research and development activities  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the public health services act  the controlled substances act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence our business 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions  including product seizures  injunction actions and criminal prosecutions 
in addition  administrative remedies can involve voluntary recall of products  and the total or partial suspension of products as well as the refusal of the government to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications 
the fda also has the authority to withdraw approval of drugs in accordance with statutory due process procedures 
fda approval is required before any dosage form of any new unapproved drug  including a generic equivalent of a previously approved drug  can be marketed 
all applications for fda approval must contain information relating to product formulation  stability  manufacturing processes  packaging  labeling and quality control 
to obtain fda approval for an unapproved new drug  a prospective manufacturer must also demonstrate compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations as well as provide substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the drug product 
compliance with cgmps is required at all times during the manufacture and processing of drugs 
such compliance requires considerable corporation time and resources in the areas of production and quality control 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause a company to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice may be issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
the fda routinely performs inspection of pharmaceutical companies facilities 
on may  the fda initiated an inspection of our facility for cgmp compliance 
this inspection will be completed over the next few weeks 
while there is no assurance that the fda will not issue observations  we believe that we are cgmp compliant 
there are generally two types of applications that would be used to obtain fda approval for pharmaceutical products new drug application nda 
generally  the nda procedure is required for drugs with active ingredients and or with a dosage form  dosage strength or delivery system of an active ingredient not previously approved by the fda 
we have not submitted an nda to date 
abbreviated new drug application anda 
the hatch waxman act established a statutory procedure for submission of andas to the fda covering generic equivalents of previously approved brand name drugs 
under the anda procedure  an applicant is not required to submit complete reports of preclinical and clinical studies of safety and efficacy  but instead is required to provide bioavailability data illustrating that the generic drug formulation is bioequivalent to a previously approved drug 
bioavailability measures the rate and extent of absorption of a drug s active ingredient and its availability at the site of drug action  typically measured through blood levels 
a generic drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug are not significantly different from that of the previously approved brand name drug 
the fda may deny an anda if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if new evidence demonstrating that the drug is unsafe or lacks efficacy for its intended uses becomes known after the product reaches the market 
as previously disclosed  we currently manufacture several products that are regulated as drug efficacy studies implementation  or desi  products 
these products do not require the submission of an anda or an nda to the fda 
these products are  however  subject to cgmp compliance 
also  while products within this desi classification require no prior approval from the fda before marketing  they must comply with applicable fda monographs  which specify  among other things  required ingredients  dosage levels  label contents and permitted uses 
these monographs may be changed from time to time  in which case we might be required to change the formulation  packaging or labeling of any affected product 
changes to monographs normally have a delayed effective date  so while we may have to incur costs to comply with any such changes  disruption of distribution is not likely 
fda policy and its stringent requirements have increased the time and expense involved in obtaining anda approvals and in complying with fda s cgmp standards 
the anda filing and approval process takes approximately to months 
the timing of final fda approval of anda applications depends on a variety of factors  including whether or not the maker of the applicable branded drug is entitled to the protection of one or more statutory exclusivity periods  during which the fda is prohibited from approving generic products 
in certain circumstances  a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent  and thus block andas from being approved on the patent expiration date 
for example  the fda may now extend the exclusivity of a product by six months past the date of a patent expiration if the manufacturer undertakes studies on the effect of their product in children a so called pediatric extension 
fda approval is required before each dosage form of any new drug can be marketed 
applications for fda approval must contain information relating to bio equivalency  product formulation  raw material suppliers  stability  manufacturing processes  packaging  labeling and quality control 
fda procedures require full scale manufacturing equipment to be used to produce test batches for fda approval 
validation of manufacturing processes by the fda also is required before a company can market new products 
the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to enforce these rules 
supplemental filings are required for approval to transfer products from one manufacturing site to another and may be under review for a year or more 
in addition  certain products may only be approved for transfer once new bio equivalency studies are conducted 
the hatch waxman act provides incentives for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products and or their methods of use  as well as to develop non infringing forms of the patented subject matter 
the hatch waxman legislation places significant burdens on the challenger to ensure that such suits are not frivolous  but also offers the opportunity for significant financial reward if the challenge is successful 
if there is a patent listed in the fda s orange book at the time of filing an anda with the fda and the generic drug company intends to market the generic equivalent prior to the expiration of that patent  the generic company files with its anda a certification asserting that the patent is invalid  unenforceable and or not infringed a so called paragraph iv certification 
after receiving notice from the fda that its application is acceptable for filing  the generic company sends the patent holder and the holder of the new drug application nda for the brand name drug a notice explaining why it believes that the patents in question are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
upon receipt of the notice from the generic company  the patent holder has days during which to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the generic company 
the discovery  trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years 
if a suit is commenced by the patent holder  the hatch waxman act provides for an automatic stay on the fda s ability to grant final approval of the anda for the generic product 
the period during which the fda may not approve the anda and the patent challenger therefore may not market the generic product is months  or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by the court 
the month period may or may not  and often does not  coincide with the timing of the resolution of the lawsuit or the expiration of a patent  but if the patent challenge is successful or the challenged patent expires during the month period  the fda may approve the generic drug for marketing  assuming there are no other obstacles to approval such as exclusivities given to the nda holder 
under the hatch waxman act  the developer of a proposed generic drug which is the first to have its anda accepted for filing by the fda  and whose filing includes a paragraph iv certification  may be eligible to receive a day period of generic market exclusivity 
this period of market exclusivity may provide the patent challenger with the opportunity to earn a return on the risks taken and its legal and development costs and to build its market share before competitors can enter the market 
the generic drug enforcement act of establishes penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda by authorizing the fda to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market off patent drugs 
the fda has authority to withdraw approval of an anda under certain circumstances and to seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of a pending anda under certain circumstances and to seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of a pending anda under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery  and illegal gratuities policy 
manufacturers of drugs must also comply with the fda s cgmp standards or risk sanctions such as the suspension of manufacturing or the seizure of drug products and the fda s refusal to approve additional andas 
the drug enforcement agency dea conducts inspections bi annually 
each domestic drug product manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda 
establishments  like ours  handling controlled substances  must be licensed by the dea 
we are licensed by both the fda and dea 
we are also subject to regulation under other federal  state and local regulations regarding work place safety  environmental protection and hazardous substance controls  among others 
specifically  we are licensed by the michigan board of pharmacy as a manufacturer and wholesaler of prescription drugs and as a distributor of controlled substances 
we are also licensed by the michigan liquor control commission to use alcohol in the manufacture of drugs 
reimbursement legislation  such as medicaid  medicare  and other programs  governs reimbursement levels 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate to individual states a percentage of their revenues arising from medicaid reimbursed drug sales 
generic drug manufacturers currently rebate an applicable percentage of calculated average manufacturer price amp marketed under andas 
we believe that the federal and state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at reducing the cost of drugs and devices to the public 
we cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on our profitability 
environment the company is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long period of time to control environmental impacts 
the company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and assure compliance with regulatory policy and procedures 
the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment 
while it is impossible to accurately predict the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential compliance with environmental laws  any compliance is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had  and is not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company s earnings or competitive position 
suppliers and materials the principal components used in our business are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and packaging materials 
some of these components are purchased from single sources  however  the majority of the components have an alternate source of supply 
development and approval of our pharmaceuticals are dependent upon our ability to procure components from fda approved sources 
because the fda approval process requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of components in their applications  fda approval of a new supplier would be required if components were no longer available from the specified suppliers 
we have been  and continue to be  actively identifying and validating alternate suppliers for our components 
our purchases of components are made from manufacturers in the us and from abroad  including sun pharma 
see sun pharmaceutical industries limited 
all purchases of components are made in us dollars 
although to date no significant difficulty has been encountered in obtaining components required for products and sources of supply are considered adequate  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain components as required 
competition the generic pharmaceutical industry is undergoing rapid and significant changes due to increasing number of generic manufacturers  introduction of authorized generics  technological advancement and consolidation among the customers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  production  and research and development resources and greater name recognition 
competition continues to be intense which could result in further erosion of prices and profit margins 
the number of generic manufacturers both domestic and from overseas is increasing resulting in increased pricing pressure 
the most significant means of competition are price  innovation and development  timely fda approval  manufacturing capabilities  product quality  marketing  customer service and reputation 
other principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market are the ability to be the first company  or among the first companies  to introduce a generic product after the related patent expires  methods of distribution  maintenance of inventories for timely delivery  and breadth of product line 
approvals for new products may have a synergistic effect on a company s entire product line since orders for new products are frequently accompanied by  or bring about  orders for other products available from the same source 
we believe that price is the most significant competitive factor in the generic industry  particularly as the number of generic entrants with respect to a particular product increases 
as competition from other manufacturers intensifies  selling prices typically decline 
we compete by keeping our prices competitive  selecting appropriate products  based on therapeutic segments  market sizes and number of competitors manufacturing the products  by providing reliability in the timely delivery  and in the continued quality  of our products 
line of credit on november   the company entered into a one year  million credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  na under the credit agreement  the lender may make loans and issue letters of credit to the company for the company s working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
letters of credit  if issued  expire one year from their date of issuance  but no later than november  during fiscal  we utilized million of the available line and have repaid the same 
borrowings are secured by the company s receivables  inventory and all proceeds therefrom 
borrowings may be prepaid at any time by the company 
interest is payable based on libor or an alternate base rate determined by reference to the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  as selected by the company 
the rate of interest is libor plus basis points or prime rate minus basis points effective rates of and  respectively at march  the credit agreement requires that certain financial covenants be met on a quarterly basis 
the corporation is in compliance with these financial covenants at march  there are no borrowings under this credit agreement at march  employees we had a total of and full time equivalent and contract employees at march  and  respectively  engaged in research and development  quality assurance  quality control  administration  sales and marketing  materials management  facility management and manufacturing and packaging 
most of our scientific and engineering employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical or medical products companies  including sun pharma 
see sun pharmaceutical industries limited 
a union represents substantially all of our permanent  full time hourly employees 
in september  we successfully negotiated a four year collective bargaining agreement with the union 
this agreement sets forth the wage increases which the union employees will receive in each of the next four years  and thereby giving us and the union employees  we believe  a measure of certainty and stability 
product liability and insurance we currently maintain general and product liability insurance  with coverage limits of million per incident and in the aggregate 
our insurance policies provide coverage on a claims made basis and are subject to annual renewal 
such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of such policies will be adequate to cover our liabilities  should they occur

risk factors risks related to our business the following discussion highlights some of the risks related to our business and others are discussed elsewhere in this report 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows and the market value of our common stock 
if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely fashion  receiving the requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability of raw materials at a competitive cost  including active pharmaceutical ingredients and other key ingredients  development and commercializing a new products is time consuming  costly and subject to various factors  including litigation brought by our competitors  that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of new products expected to market  our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix including new launches  our product pricing  customer class of trade  and our costs for active ingredients 
some specific issues that could result in a fluctuation could include any or all of the following  the amount of new product introductions  the level of competition and associated pricing pressure in the marketplace for certain products  the availability of raw materials  the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for all our products  the costs of excipients purchased from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
an unaffiliated third party may make a claim for royalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in  we entered into a products agreement with an unaffiliated generic drug company the non affiliate 
under the agreement  two products were to be delivered to us in exchange for royalties and options 
pursuant to the agreement  we received a formulation for one product the product from the non affiliate 
however  we have determined that the formula provided to us by the non affiliate with respect to the product is different than the formula approved by the fda and manufactured and introduced by us 
accordingly  since april  we have discontinued to accrue royalties 
the product has been one of our top selling products 
there is no assurance that the non affiliate will not challenge our determination and make a claim that royalties and or options are owed 
if successful  such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if brand pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through litigation  legislature and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many brand pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory and other litigation as means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent  which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of our generic product  submitting for changes in u 
s 
pharmacopoeia which is an organization that publishes industry wide compendia of drug standards  using the citizen s petition process to request amendments to fda standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  engage in state by state initiative to enact legislation that restricts substitution of certain generic drugs which could possibly impact products that we are developing 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
if it is found that we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a product s  which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our policies regarding returns and chargebacks by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic product manufacturers including caraco have liberal return policies and make decisions whether or not to provide shelf stock allowances or credits for inventories on hand on product that has already been sold to the customer 
if a new competitor enters the marketplace and significantly lowers the price of any of its competing products  it is possible that we would make a decision to reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide significant credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesale customers that have contracts with us for their sales to chain drug retail  group purchasing organizations  or other retail customers 
a chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid to us by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler s customer pays for that product 
although we establish reserves based on our historical experience and our best estimates of the potential impact that these policies may have  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and market price of our stock 
the loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of key personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel 
extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  are subject to complex  costly regulations that continue to evolve as set forth by the federal government  principally the fda and to a lesser extent by the dea and state government agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act and other federal statutes and regulations govern the testing  manufacturing  storage  packing  labeling  record keeping  safety  sales and marketing  promotion  and distribution of our products 
under these regulations  we are subject to periodic routine inspection of our facilities  procedures  operations and the testing of our products by the fda  the dea and other authorities that regulate our business 
these inspections are designed to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
following an inspection  the fda may issue notices on form and or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to promptly and adequately achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
possible sanctions could include among others  fda issuance of adverse publicity  fines  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions  and civil or criminal prosecution 
these sanctions  if imposed  could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs in place these programs may not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
certain of our vendors that sell to us are also subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections 
sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of the distribution network and the concentration of customers 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors  major retail drug store chains and managed care 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains and managed care companies 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors and large chain drug stores and managed care providers control a significant share of the market 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers  retailers and managed care providers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including caraco 
even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new pharmaceutical products  the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance 
levels of market acceptance for our new products could be impacted by several factors  including availability of alternate product from our competitors  the timing of our market entry  acceptance of our product on government and private formularies  and the prices that we sell our products at versus our competitors prices 
these factors amongst others are beyond our control and could materially have a negative effect on operations and the market value of our common stock 
from time to time a relatively small group of products could represent a significant portion of our sales and if the products sales of these product decline unexpectedly it could have a negative material effect on our business and could cause our market value of our common stock to decline 
sales of a limited number of our products often represent a significant portion of our net revenues and net earnings 
if the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future  our business  financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected  and the market value of our common stock could decline 
our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons  including that they may have proprietary processes or product delivery systems  larger research and development and marketing staffs  larger production capacity in general or for a given product  more financial resources than caraco  more experience in developing new drugs  our reporting and payment obligations under medicaid and other governmental programs are complex and may change periodically based upon new guidelines provided those agencies 
although the regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations are complex  we believe we are properly and accurately calculating and reporting the amounts owed in respect of medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
our calculations are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies  and it is possible that any such review could result in material changes 
any governmental agencies may initiate an investigation of the company and could impose  based on a claim of violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise  civil and or criminal sanctions  including fines  penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs including medicaid and medicare 
sun global could determine not to assist us in our research and development and sun pharma could cease supplying support and raw materials collectively sun global and sun pharma could determine that its own research and development takes precedent over the research and development it provides to caraco 
this could cause a gap in our research and development timelines until caraco could increase its own capabilities 
this gap could possibly cause future growth concerns until resolved 
sun pharma which supplies us raw material could face supply issues or not be capable of supplying the raw material for certain products we manufacture 
this could cause lower sales or possibly lower margins until we negotiate new suppliers and gain the requisite approvals to manufacture our product with a new raw material source 
a significant portion of our net sales are from the sales of a limited number of customers 
should we lose a particular contract with a customer or the customer is acquired by a non customer  our sales and operational results could face a significant decline 
a significant portion of our net revenues are derived from sales to a limited number of customers 
as such  a reduction in or loss of business with one customer  or if one customer were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis  our business  financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our product liability insurance may not be enough to mitigate risk associated with our products though we believe we carry adequate product liability insurance it is possible that a lawsuit or lawsuits could exceed our insurance levels and have a negative impact on our financial results we manufacture our product line predominately from one fda approved facility 
there is a possibility that our production could be negatively impacted by a closure of this facility should our facility located in detroit incur a closure of any type it would have a negative impact on our results 
we carry a limited amount of finished goods on hand and much of our inventory is either work in progress or is in bulk amounts 
should we experience an act of god that closes our facility  or production is stopped or a power outage continues for an inordinate period of time  it could have a significant negative effect on our results 
any of these factors and others could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline

the facilities our entire property  plant  equipment and intellectual property are free of any mortgages  liens or similar restrictions 
our primary facility located in detroit  michigan  which was designed and constructed to our specifications and completed in  contains our production  research and development and corporate office 
during fiscal  we added approximately  square feet of manufacturing space  giving us a total of  square feet of usable space 
the manufacturing portion of the facility has a special building and systems design  with each processing area equipped with independent zone and air handling units to provide temperature and humidity control to each room 
these air handling units are designed to prevent product cross contamination through the use of pre filter and final hepa filter banks 
all processing air quarters are maintained in a negative pressure mode using laminar airflow design 
this system of airflow provides a measurable control of air borne particulate entrapment in each room 
environmental segregation of individual rooms within a particular zone is accomplished by the use of duct hepa filter booster fan units that facilitate the isolation and confinement of room activities 
these special dynamics provide an added dimension and flexibility in product selection and processing techniques 
we have leased an approximately  square foot facility located near our primary facility for finished goods distribution  storage of inventory and office space 
the lease expires in and includes an option to renew until we also have leased an approximately  square foot office space for our administrative  sales and marketing and accounting offices 
the lease expires in we have invested approximately million during fiscal as compared to million during twelve months ending march  to upgrade our facilities 
we have invested approximately million during the transition period as compared to million during the corresponding period of we invested million in and million in we believe the existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our current level of operations and anticipated growth in the near future 
we also believe that our facilities are adequately covered by insurance

the following discussion and analysis provides information that the management believes is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgments 
as a result  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant estimates include our provisions for price adjustments primarily chargebacks  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and valuation of overhead components in inventory 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
there have neither been material changes to our critical accounting policies for the periods presented nor any material quantitative revisions to our critical accounting estimates for the periods presented 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  shipment of the goods has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience and current market trends adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
these revenue reductions are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance 
chargebacks chargebacks represent our most significant provision against gross accounts receivable and related reduction to gross revenue 
chargebacks are credits given to our wholesale customers for the price difference on our product they sell at a contractual price to retail  chain stores  and managed care organizations at prices lower than we sell to our wholesale customer 
we record an estimate at the end of the reporting period to the wholesaler of the amount to be charged back to us  over and above those already received by us 
such estimated amounts  in addition to certain other deductions  are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
we have recorded provisions for chargebacks based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends  and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates  if any  would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the amount that will ultimately be charged back to us by our wholesaler customers  there could be a material impact on our financial statements 
we consider the following factors in the determination of the estimates of chargebacks 
we consider the historical data of chargebacks as a percentage of sales  as well as the various chargeback reports that we receive from the customers 
volume of product sold to wholesalers and the average chargeback rates  on a quarterly and annualized basis are applied to current period and annual product sales to make a realistic accrual 
the sales trends for future estimated prices  wholesale acquisition cost wac  the contract prices with the retailers  chain stores and managed care organizations end users 
our prices with the wholesalers and end users are contracted prices 
shelf stock adjustments shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our product 
these credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce the customers inventory cost to better reflect current market prices 
the determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion 
factors considered when recording a reserve for a shelf stock adjustments include estimated launch dates of competing products based on market intelligence  estimated decline in market price of our product based on historical experience and input from customers and levels of inventory held by customers at the date of the adjustments as provided by them 
product returns and other allowances in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for credit if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within a month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to six months after the expiration date 
we estimate the level of sale  which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of our products and our future expectations 
we periodically review the reserves established for returns and adjust them based on actual experience  if necessary 
the primary factors we consider in estimating our potential product returns include shelf life of expiration date of each product and historical levels of expired product returns 
in case we become aware of any returns due to product related issues  such information from the customers  is used to estimate an additional reserve 
the amount of actual product return could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates  if any  would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
discounts trade and prompt payment discounts are accrued at the end of every reporting period based on the gross sales made to the customers during the period and based on their terms of trade 
we review the contracts between the customer and us as well as the historical data and percentages to estimate the discount accrual 
customer rebates are estimated at every period end  based on direct or indirect purchases 
if the purchases are direct  the rebates are recognized when products are purchased and a periodic credit is given 
for indirect purchases  the rebates are recognized based on the terms with such customer 
medicaid rebates are estimated based on the historical data we receive from the public sector benefit providers  which is based on the final dispensing of our product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
doubtful accounts doubtful accounts are estimated based on the data available from external sources  including information on financial condition of customers 
also  a regular review of past due receivables is done on a quarterly basis to identify and make provision for such receivables not expected to be recovered 
our gross sales for fiscal were million  as compared to million for fiscal chargebacks  returns  discounts and other customary customer deductions and other sales costs constituted approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  as compared to million for fiscal the primary cause of increase in the sales diluters by almost between the periods is the impact of price erosions for the products we sell and the corresponding impact of such price erosions on chargebacks the following is a roll forward of the provisions for chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments  returns and allowances and estimated doubtful account allowances during fiscal and fiscal in millions allowances charged to gross sales balances at begining of period current period prior period credits taken by customers balance at the end of period for fiscal chargebacks shelf stock adjustments returns and other allowances doubtful accounts for fiscal chargebacks shelf stock adjustments returns and other allowances doubtful accounts income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable for the differences that are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any federal tax provision or benefit for the fiscal  the transition period or for the years ended december  and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at march   march   december  and at march   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income  which will expire between and under the provisions of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards which can be used in future years 
we believe that ownership changes to date will not limit future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost of raw materials  work in process and finished goods using the specific identification cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete and inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
materials acquired for r d on products yet to be launched are written off in the year of acquisition 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management 
a critical estimate in this determination is the estimate of the future expected inventory requirements  whereby we compare our internal sales forecasts to inventory on hand 
actual results may differ from those estimates and inventory write offs may be required 
we must also make estimates about the amount of manufacturing overhead to allocate to our finished goods and work in process inventories 
although the manufacturing process is generally similar for our products  we must make judgments as to the portion of costs to allocate to purchased product  work in process and finished goods  and such allocations can vary based upon the composition of these components and the fact that each product produced does not necessarily require the same amount of time or effort for the same production step 
accordingly  the assumptions we make can impact the value of reported inventories and cost of sales 
fda compliance the fda commenced an inspection of the company s facility on may  this is a routine inspection which will continue over the next few weeks 
while there is no assurance that the fda will not issue observations  we believe that we are cgmp compliant
