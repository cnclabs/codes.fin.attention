item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marketplace conditions our operating results for fiscal reflected significant growth in net sales when compared with fiscal  even when excluding sales of krone and fons  which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
we believe that there is a general trend in our industry toward modest overall spending increases from the historical low levels experienced from fiscal through fiscal however  overall spending on communications equipment and services remains at significantly lower levels than existed prior to fiscal and customers appear to be selective about areas where they are willing to increase spending 
specifically  we believe that spending increases by our customers are likely to be more pronounced in fttx initiatives as well as in the wireless and enterprise areas 
we undertook our recent acquisition of fons to help expand our position as a leader in the fttx space 
we also believe that capital spending budgets remain constrained  and any increases in spending in specific areas therefore may cause service providers to decrease spending in other areas 
initiatives to increase spending on fttx projects may be causing decreases in spending on other wireline initiatives 
ongoing consolidation among communications service providers may cause such companies to defer spending while they focus on integrating combined businesses 
in addition  our industry continues to experience very intense competition and increased pricing pressure from our customers 
subject to telecom industry spending cycles  we currently anticipate at least slow year over year growth in the overall market for spending on communications equipment and services in the near term 
there is increased competition among telephone  wireless and cable providers 
this is causing service providers to upgrade their networks to offer internet  voice  video and data services at low  often flat rate  prices to attract and retain customers 
the rate at which these providers respond to each other s competitive threats may impact the rate of sales growth we might experience and place pressure on our gross profit margins 
while we are cautious about our ability to be successful in achieving continued revenue growth  we believe several factors may provide us with the opportunity to increase our sales faster than growth in the overall market in our fiscal such sales growth could be achieved through new product offerings  such as our omnireach tm fttx solutions being deployed by several communications service providers and the growing acceptance of our digivance wireless coverage solution and our truenet and copperten tm enterprise solutions  opportunities to cross sell products among adc s traditional customer base and the traditional customer base of krone following our acquisition of krone in may  and increasing our market share in certain areas as we have done recently with respect to some of our product lines 
we continue to be dependent on telecommunications service providers for a majority of our sales  although this dependence has recently declined to some degree because of our krone acquisition 
the four major us telephone companies verizon  bellsouth  qwest and sbc accounted for  and of our net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in these customer concentration levels from fiscal to fiscal is largely because the krone acquisition gave us a more diversified customer base throughout the world 
however  the increased diversification may be offset by mergers among our customers or acquisitions we undertake  such as our recent acquisition of fons 
the long term impact of customer mergers on our business is difficult to predict 
in addition  in the product areas where we believe the potential for sales growth is most pronounced eg  fttx initiatives  wireless products and enterprise  our sales remain highly concentrated with the large us telephone and wireless companies 
we believe the historical seasonality of our sales  whereby the strongest demand for our products was during our fourth fiscal quarter ending october  may no longer apply to our business 
this seasonality trend in our sales generally existed prior to the downturn in the telecommunications equipment market when our business was more focused on central office based products 
we believe our expansion into new growth markets of fttx  wireless and enterprises may have changed this seasonality in our business 
our sales of these products have fluctuated from quarter to quarter  something we expect to continue 
in addition  in fiscal  it appears that many of our customers may have accelerated their annual capital spending in the first calendar half of while the historical seasonality trend of our central office based business may no longer be apparent  we still expect sales in our first fiscal quarter to be lower than in other quarters 
this is because of the number of holidays in that quarter and the development of annual capital spending budgets that many of our customers undertake during that time frame 
the working days by quarter in fiscal is days in the first quarter  days in the second quarter  days in the third quarter and days in the fourth quarter 
we are continuing to focus on ways to conduct our operations more efficiently and to reduce costs 
during the downturn in the telecommunications equipment industry in fiscal years through  we took significant cost reduction measures 
we believe most of our restructuring activity related to that downturn is completed  but we continue to pursue expense reductions 
for example  the integration of the krone acquisition has presented opportunities to reduce costs through the consolidation of duplicative facilities  the movement of operations into lower cost locations and the elimination of duplicative processes and personnel functions 
following our acquisition of fons  we will seek additional opportunities to reduce costs and gain economies of scale  although such opportunities are more limited because the operations of fons are significantly smaller than were those of krone when we completed that acquisition 
accordingly  we anticipate incurring additional restructuring charges in future periods associated with our ongoing initiative to be a cost leader 
we intend to continue to explore additional product line or business acquisitions that are complimentary to our communications infrastructure business 
we believe our acquisition of fons will enhance our fttx and other connectivity solution offerings 
in addition  we recently completed the acquisition of opencell  which should enhance our digivance wireless coverage solution offering 
we expect to fund other potential acquisitions with existing cash resources  the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock  the issuance of debt or equity linked securities or through some combination of these alternatives 
in addition  we will continue to monitor all of our businesses and may determine that it is appropriate to sell or otherwise dispose of certain operations 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our professional services operations in the united kingdom 
this sale was completed primarily because the business was not profitable and we did not believe we were realizing sufficient sales of our hardware products through this part of our services operation 
a detailed description of many of the risks to our business can be found in item a under the caption risk factors

net sales fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were  million and million for fiscal and  respectively  a increase exclusive of the krone acquisition 
the krone acquisition accounted for of the net sales increase over fiscal sales generated from fons and opencell in fiscal following their acquisitions do not constitute a significant portion of net sales 
excluding the krone acquisition  our sales growth for fiscal was driven by strong  broad based growth among our comprehensive communication infrastructure solutions 
international net sales were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in international sales is due primarily to our acquisition of krone  which has a greater mix of international sales 
during fiscal  net sales of broadband infrastructure and access products increased by compared to fiscal our broadband infrastructure and access segment includes infrastructure connectivity and access wireless and wireline products 
the inclusion of sales by krone beginning on may   accounts for of the increase for fiscal  with the remaining increase primarily due to increased sales of our legacy broadband infrastructure and access products 
for fiscal  net sales of our connectivity products increased compared to fiscal  with the krone acquisition accounting for of the increase 
sales of our fiber connectivity products represented of the net connectivity increase over fiscal  largely the result of increased sales of our omnireach fttx products  which had minimal sales in fiscal sales of fttx products have fluctuated quarter over quarter  and we expect this trend to continue  based on the timing of customer deployments 
for fiscal  net sales of our wireless products increased compared to fiscal this was largely a result of increased demand for our digivance products  due to production of a new product  as well as an improved supply chain for certain digivance components 
sales of our digivance products are continuing to grow because of sales to verizon and nextel for deployments in large north american cities 
however  sales of digivance have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate  from one quarter to the next due to the timing of new products and customer deployments 
in fiscal  net sales of our wireline products decreased by compared to fiscal this decrease was caused primarily by a general industry wide decline in the market demand for high bit rate digital subscriber line products as carriers undertake product substitution by delivering fiber and internet protocol services closer to end user premises 
we expect this industry wide trend in market demand to continue into the future 
net sales of our professional services segment increased compared to fiscal  with the krone acquisition representing of the increase 
in addition  increased sales to several key customers contributed to the growth in net sales of professional services 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  which was a increase 
international net sales were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  net sales of broadband infrastructure and access products increased by compared to fiscal our broadband infrastructure and access segment includes infrastructure connectivity and access wireless and wireline products 
the inclusion of sales by the krone group beginning on may   accounts for of the increase for fiscal with the remaining increase being accounted for primarily through increased sales of connectivity and wireless products 
for fiscal  sales of our connectivity and wireless products increased and  respectively  compared to fiscal the inclusion of million in sales by krone beginning on may   as well as fttx sales  accounted for of the increase in connectivity product sales for fiscal the remaining increase in connectivity sales was attributable primarily to increased spending by our customers in the legacy central office space 
wireless sales increased primarily due to growing acceptance of our digivance product 
for fiscal  net sales of our wireline products decreased by from the comparable period 
the decrease in wireline product sales was caused by a combination of decreased volumes and price reductions resulting from decreased demand for certain types of products within the industry generally and competitive pressures 
net sales of our professional services segment increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the inclusion of krone s professional services business krone services resulted in a million increase in net sales in fiscal this increase  however  was partially offset by a decline in sales of adc s historical professional services 
excluding krone services  a significant customer of our professional services segment represented of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decreased spending by this customer  however  was largely offset by market share gains with other customers 
gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages were exclusive of the krone acquisition and exclusive of the krone acquisition during fiscal and  respectively 
the acquisition of fons and opencell do not constitute a significant portion of gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit percentage was due to increases in sales of lower margin products  many of which came to us through our acquisition of krone 
overall  increased sales from fttx products and professional services segment  both of which are lower margin businesses  were partially offset by an increase in sales of our higher margin connectivity and wireless products 
the mix of products we sell is variable  as a result  our future gross margin rate is difficult to predict accurately 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal and  gross profit percentages were and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to a more favorable sales mix toward higher margin products and a reduction in our fixed costs of sales as a result of our restructuring activities 
we also benefited from production efficiencies and cost reductions resulting from more favorable supplier pricing  which was the result of increased purchasing power due to the krone acquisition and the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing operations 
operating expenses fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  representing and of net sales  respectively 
krone operating expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the acquisitions of fons and opencell do not constitute a significant portion of fiscal operating expenses 
excluding the effect of the krone operating expenses  operating expenses increased compared to fiscal  mainly due to the change in selling and administration expenses discussed below 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an increase of compared to fiscal this increase was almost entirely attributable to spending on projects related to krone based products 
given the rapidly changing technological and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry  continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive 
accordingly  we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources  as a percentage of our net sales  to product development in each of our segments 
most of our research and development will be directed towards projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims and have a higher probability to return our investment 
selling and administration selling and administration expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an increase of exclusive of the krone acquisition compared to fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses is due primarily to incentive payments made to employees in fiscal that have been partially offset by a decrease in the number of leased facilities 
in addition  in fiscal  there were million of one time benefits  primarily due to bad debt recoveries for which we previously had established reserves 
in fiscal  we incurred added administrative expense  including external advisory fees of million associated with the requirements to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of compliance with section requires us to conduct a thorough evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting 
while we expect such fees to decline in the future  there is an ongoing need for us to allocate internal resources and to work with independent advisors in this process 
impairment charges impairment charges declined in fiscal million compared to million in fiscal 
in fiscal we wrote off certain manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements when it was determined that these assets had no further value 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate principally to employee severance and facility consolidation costs resulting from the closure of facilities and other workforce reductions attributable to our efforts to reduce costs 
during fiscal  approximately employees were impacted by reductions in force  principally in our broadband infrastructure and access segment 
during fiscal  approximately employees were impacted by reductions in force  principally in corporate functions 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  representing and of net sales  respectively 
included in these operating expenses were restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
krone operating expenses were million in fiscal  representing costs incurred from and after the close of the acquisition on may  excluding krone  operating expenses decreased in fiscal although the largest factor in the decrease in operating expenses was the reduction in the amount of our restructuring and impairment charges  our operating expenses also declined due to the ongoing cost savings from those restructuring efforts 
research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
krone represented of the fiscal expense 
we allocate substantial resources  as a percentage of net sales  to product development in each of our operating segments 
selling and administration selling and administration expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal krone represented of the increase in fiscal the remaining increase was due to million of krone integration costs and million of increased incentive accruals  partially offset by million of decreased facility costs resulting from ongoing restructuring 
impairment charges impairment charges represent a write down of the carrying value of fixed assets to their estimated fair market value 
these charges declined in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for a building included in assets held for sale when it was determined the carrying value for the property exceeded market value 
the fair market value was determined based on an examination of sales prices for similar properties 
impairment charges affected both the broadband infrastructure and access segment and the professional services segment 
fiscal impairment charges consisted solely of property and equipment impairments  which impacted both the broadband infrastructure and access segment and the professional services segment  and were caused by our plan to dispose of excess equipment 
the fair market value was determined using external sources  primarily proceeds received from previous equipment sales or estimates of discounted cash flows 
restructuring charges restructuring charges represent the direct costs of consolidating certain leased facilities and severance costs for workforce reductions 
our restructuring charges also declined significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
the fiscal restructuring charges consisted of million of employee severance for workforce reductions and million of facility consolidation charges 
employee terminations affected both the broadband infrastructure and access segment and the professional services segment 
the million of restructuring charges in fiscal related to our actions to downsize our business in response to declining sales 
these restructuring charges include million of employee severance and million of facility consolidation charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further discussion of our impairment and restructuring charges

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies because they are impacted significantly by estimates we make 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with current or committed inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods for previously sold equipment 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due primarily to improving market conditions 
it is possible that significant increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a decline in market conditions 
alternatively  if we are able to sell previously reserved inventory  we will reverse a portion of the reserves 
changes in inventory reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we had million and million  respectively  reserved against our inventories  which represents and  respectively  of total inventory on hand 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting leased facilities and employee severance 
if such costs constitute an ongoing benefit arrangement that is probable and estimable  accruals are established pursuant to fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas no 

all other restructuring accruals are established pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 

restructuring charges represent our best estimate of the associated liability at the date the charges are taken 
significant judgment is required in estimating the restructuring costs of leased facilities 
for example  we make certain assumptions with respect to when a facility will be subleased and the amount of sublease income 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period they become known 
changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  when product ownership and the risk of loss has transferred to the customer  we have no remaining obligation  persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
revenue from services consists of fees for systems requirements  design and analysis  customization and installation services  ongoing system management  enhancements and maintenance 
we primarily apply the percentage of completion method to arrangements consisting of design  customization and installation 
the assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether collection of trade and notes receivable are reasonably assured based on various factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers that could result in us being unable to collect or sell the receivables 
in situations where it is unclear whether we will be able to sell or collect the receivable  revenue and related costs are deferred 
related costs are recognized when it has been determined that the collection of the receivable is unlikely 
we record provisions against our gross revenue for estimated product returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in our customers demands 
should our actual product returns and allowances exceed our estimates  additional reductions to our revenue would result 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also derived using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
significant increases may occur in the future due to deteriorating market conditions 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and  if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
changes in the allowance are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
as of october  and  we had million and million  respectively  reserved against our accounts receivable  which represents and  respectively  of total accounts receivable 
the decrease in allowance for uncollectible accounts from to is due to improved collections 
warranty we provide reserves for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
changes in warranty reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we reserved million and million  respectively  related to future estimated warranty costs 
recoverability of long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we perform impairment reviews at a reporting unit level and use a discounted cash flow model based on management s judgment and assumptions to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  tax rates  and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
all assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are consistent with management s internal planning 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used  the balances for long lived assets could have been materially impacted 
income taxes and deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets primarily in the united states as a result of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principles 
a deferred tax asset represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not realize these assets 
our decision was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred to that point as well as the full utilization of our loss carryback potential 
from the third quarter of fiscal to date  we have maintained our policy of providing a nearly full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we expect to continue to provide a nearly full allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
as of october   our net deferred tax assets were  million with a related valuation allowance of  million 
as of october   our net deferred tax assets were  million with a related valuation allowance of  million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
litigation reserves as of october  and  we had recorded approximately million and million in loss reserves for pending litigation 
this reserve is based on the application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss is capable of reasonable estimation 
as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  and in part i  item of this form k legal proceedings  we are a party to numerous lawsuits  proceedings and claims 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss or the amount thereof requires the exercise of considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to any particular matter 
pensions we acquired krone in may  which maintains a defined benefit pension for a portion of its german workforce 
a participating individual s post retirement pension benefit is based primarily on the individual s years of service and earnings 
the plan is accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
that measurement includes estimates relating to the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities  which reflects the current rate at which the pension liability could effectively be settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this discount rate  we considered rates of return on high grade fixed income investments with similar duration to the plan liability 
we used a discount rate of at october  a quarter percentage point increase decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease increase the post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively

sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle applied as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas in our fiscal year beginning november  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 sfas 
sfas amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas in our fiscal year beginning november  in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  sfas 
this statement requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
this statement also requires that fixed production overhead be allocated to inventory conversion costs based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred by us beginning in fiscal we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas r which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for periods that begin after june   which is our first quarter beginning november  we will use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
compensation cost for awards granted prior to  but not vested  as of the date sfas r is adopted would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to value those awards for proforma purposes under sfas we expect the adoption of this standard will reduce fiscal net income by approximately million 
this estimate is based on the number of options currently outstanding and exercisable and could change based on the number of options granted or forfeited in fiscal in december  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  fsp 
fsp allows a company time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the american jobs creation act of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations 
fsp will not impact us because we do not plan on repatriating our foreign earnings 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities not subject to restrictions were million at october   a decrease of million compared to million as of october  the reasons for this decrease are described below 
we invest a large portion of our available cash in highly liquid government bonds and high quality corporate debt securities of varying maturities 
our investment policy is to manage these assets to preserve principal  maintain adequate liquidity at all times  and maximize returns subject to our investment guidelines 
auction rate securities reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to current available for sale securities as of october  and were million and million  respectively 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
these reclassifications have no effect on current assets  working capital or any amounts reported on the statement of operations 
restricted cash balances that are pledged primarily as collateral for letters of credit and lease obligations affect our liquidity 
as of october   we had restricted cash of million compared to million as of october   an increase of million 
restricted cash is expected to become available to us upon satisfaction of the obligations pursuant to which the letters of credit or guarantees were issued 
in addition  we have million of restricted cash related to our fons acquisition  which is held in trust to be paid to fons employees over the course of the next nine months 
we are entitled to the interest earnings on our restricted cash balances and interest earned on restricted cash is included in cash and cash equivalents 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal totaled million  a million decrease from the cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal this decrease was largely driven by an increase in inventory and accounts receivable related to the manufacture and sales of fttx and wireless products  along with an million reduction in accrued liabilities  primarily for restructuring and incentive payments 
offsetting this additional cash outflow was increased year over year net income from continuing operations 
working capital requirements will typically increase or decrease with changes in the level of net sales 
in addition  the timing of certain accrued payments will affect the annual cash flow 
our employee incentive payments are accrued throughout the fiscal year but paid during the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal totaled million  a million increase from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal this increase was primarily related to increased year over year net income from continuing operations 
investing activities investing activities used million during fiscal year cash used by investing activities included million for the acquisition of opencell and million for the fons acquisition  plus million for property and equipment additions 
cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment  million related to the sale of a vendor note receivable  million from receipts on notes receivable and million related to proceeds from the sale of our metrica service assurance software group 
investing activities used million during fiscal cash used by investing activities included primarily related to the krone acquisition 
cash provided by investing activities included million related to proceeds from the sale of our divested entities 
investing activities used million during fiscal cash used by investing activities included million for property and equipment additions and a net increase of million in available for sale securities  primarily related to the investment of proceeds related to the sale our convertible notes 
cash provided by investing activities included an increase of million in restricted cash 
financing activities financing activities provided million of cash during fiscal  primarily consisting of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock for certain employee benefit plans 
financing activities used million during fiscal this was primarily related to million payments on notes payable 
financing activities provided million during fiscal  primarily related to the net proceeds from issuance of our million convertible unsecured subordinated notes 
unsecured debt as of october  we had outstanding million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes  consisting of million in fixed rate convertible unsecured subordinated notes maturing on june   and million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes with a variable interest rate and maturing on june  the interest rate for the variable rate notes is equal to the month libor plus  and is reset on each semi annual interest payment date june and december of each year beginning on december  
the interest rate on the variable rate notes was for the six month period ending december   but rose to for the period december  to june  the holders of both the fixed and variable rate notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of per share 
we may not redeem the fixed rate notes anytime prior to their maturity date 
we may redeem any or all of the variable rate notes at any time on or after june  financing arrangements as a part of the divestitures of cuda and singl 
eview  we agreed to extend to the parties non revolving credit facility financing arrangements 
as of october   we had commitments to extend credit of million 
the total amount drawn and outstanding under these arrangements was approximately million on both october  and the commitments to extend credit are conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates  conditions and purposes 
these commitments may expire without being drawn 
we regularly review all outstanding commitments and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the overall risk for possible credit losses 
vendor financing in the past we have worked with customers and third party financiers to negotiate financing arrangements for projects 
as of october  and  approximately million was outstanding relating to such financing arrangements 
at october  and  we have recorded approximately million in loss reserves in the event of non performance related to these financing arrangements 
working capital and liquidity outlook our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash resources  which include existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures to execute our near term business plan 
this is based on current business operations and economic conditions so long as we are able to maintain breakeven or positive cash flows from operations 
we expect that our entire restructuring accrual of million as of october  will be paid from our unrestricted cash as follows million for employee severance will be paid by the end of fiscal million for facilities consolidation costs  which relate principally to excess leased facilities  will be paid in fiscal  and the remainder of million  which also relates to excess leased facilities  will be paid over the respective lease terms ending through we also believe that our unrestricted cash resources will enable us to pursue strategic opportunities  including possible product line or business acquisitions 
however  if the cost of one or more acquisition opportunities exceeds our existing cash resources  additional sources may be required 
we do not currently have any committed lines of credit or other available credit facilities  and it is uncertain whether such facilities could be obtained in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
any plan to raise additional capital may involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as another issuance of convertible debt or the issuance of common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to existing shareowners 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility and higher interest expense could dilute earnings per share 
our million of fixed rate convertible notes do not mature until june  and the other million of variable rate convertible notes do not mature until june  all convertible notes have a conversion price of per share 
in addition  our deferred tax assets  which are nearly fully reserved at this time  should reduce our income tax payable on taxable earnings in future years 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october   the following table summarizes our commitments in millions to make long term debt and lease payments and certain other contractual obligations 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum pension obligations total includes interest on the fixed rate debt of and interest on our variable rate debt of 
the interest rate for our variable rate debt resets on each semi annual interest payment date 
for purposes of this schedule  we used the rate as reset on december  amounts represent non cancelable commitments to purchase goods and services  including items such as inventory and information technology support 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our major market risk exposures relate to adverse fluctuations in certain commodity prices  interest rates  security prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial condition adversely 
at times  we attempt to reduce this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of issuing million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes on june   that have a variable interest rate equal to month libor plus 
the interest rate on these notes is reset semiannually on each interest payment date  which is june and december of each year until their maturity in fiscal the interest rate for the six month period ending december  was  but rose to for the current six month period ending june  assuming interest rates rise an additional basis points  basis points and  basis points  our annual interest expense would increase by million  million and million  respectively 
we offer a non qualified k excess plan to allow certain executives to defer earnings in excess of the annual individual contribution and compensation limits on k plans imposed by the us internal revenue code 
under this plan  the salary deferrals and our matching contributions are not placed in a separate fund or trust account 
rather  the deferrals represent our unsecured general obligation to pay the balance owing to the executives upon termination of their employment 
in addition  the executives are able to elect to have their account balances indexed to a variety of diversified mutual funds stock  bond and balanced  as well as to our common stock 
accordingly  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation under this plan is subject to market risk 
as of october   our outstanding deferred compensation obligation related to the k excess plan was million  of which approximately million was indexed to adc common stock 
assuming a  or aggregate increase in the value of the investment alternatives to which the account balances may be indexed  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation would increase by million  million and million  respectively  and we would incur an expense of a like amount 
we also are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary risk is the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating sales and expenses 
our largest exposure comes from the mexican peso 
the result of a weakening in the us dollar to mexican peso denominated sales and expenses would result in a reduction of operating income of million for the year ended october  this exposure remained unhedged as of october  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of changes in intercompany balance sheet accounts and other balance sheet items 
at october   these balance sheet exposures were mitigated through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of less than months 
the principal currency exposure being mitigated was the australian dollar 
during july  the people s bank of china announced that it would change from its policy of fixing the value of the yuan to the us dollar to a floating rate regime managed against a basket of currencies 
although this change may create additional foreign currency risk  we do not expect that it will have a material impact on our results of operations or foreign currency risk management strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about our foreign currency exchange derivative program
