table of contents overview we are a leading national provider of tutoring and other supplemental education services to pre kindergarten through twelfth grade  pre k students

our learning center segment also provides tutoring services in europe under the sch lerhilfe brand name and delivers educational products including the highly regarded hooked on phonics early reading  math and study skills programs 
we also provide tutoring  as well as other supplemental education services and special needs services  to public and private schools through government funded contracts in our catapult learning segment under catapult learning and other brand names 
beginning in  we began to manage the operations of our previous online learning services segment within our learning center segment 
all segment information has been restated to conform to the new presentation

our acquisition of the pre k business of laureate and ventures was completed on june  the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  consisting of cash  a subordinated note issued to laureate which has since been repaid with the proceeds of our new secured credit facility  the surrender of laureate and ventures securities held by affiliates of apollo and a deferred portion of the purchase price of million 
on october   the company announced its intention to sell its education station business  which delivers site based no child left behind services to public schools

business strategy our goal is to strengthen our position as a leading provider of tutoring and other supplemental education products and services 
our strategy includes the following elements drive same territory learning center growth 
we intend to drive same territory revenue growth and operating income growth by improving the effectiveness of our marketing  applying proven best practices in service  pricing and convenience and expanding our service offerings to address consumer demand 
expand our sylvan learning center system 
we believe there is significant potential to establish new sylvan learning centers in new territories 
make our services more accessible 
we intend to grow our consumer business through addressing our customers desire for convenience by opening additional sylvan learning centers in existing territories and expanding online tutoring which offers real time individualized instruction 
acquire select franchised territories 
we acquire franchised territories in areas where we wish to build or expand a strategic geographic presence to improve our operating results from these territories 

table of contents expand use of the sylvan and hooked on phonics brands 
we continue to look for opportunities to expand the use of our brands  including potentially licensing them to educational book and software publishers and for other educational products and by developing products and services that appeal to a broader range of customers  including parents of children in the pre school and early elementary learning levels 
expand our product offerings 
we intend to grow our products business by increasing the number of products offered and expanding our distribution channels 
some of the information contained in this section and elsewhere in this form k includes forward looking statements 
our historical and expected financial performance is influenced by several important trends 
in our learning center segment  revenues have increased and are expected to continue to increase due to several factors 
since january   the number of franchised territories has increased by from to at december   contributing to our revenue growth through licensing fees on the sales of franchise territories and increased royalties 
in addition  the number of company owned territories has grown by from to during the same period  principally through the acquisition of franchisee owned territories and  to a lesser extent  the opening of new company owned territories 
we actively seek to increase our revenues in existing territories by focusing on key variables  such as advertising response rates  hourly rates and hours per student 
some of the strategies that we have employed include improving the effectiveness of our advertising message  recommending diagnostic tests in multiple subjects  improving our consultative sales processes  enhancing financing options for our customers and increasing the frequency of sessions to promote more rapid student progress 
in  we increased the rate of franchise territory acquisitions from historical rates  resulting in the acquisition of territories in we anticipate that  as a result  our revenues may increase and operating margin as a percentage of revenue may decline as we acquire franchised territories and recognize the full revenues and cost of these territories on a consolidated basis instead of recognizing franchise royalties alone 
we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our same territory sales results 
in  in an effort to improve our students academic results and increase our revenue and operating profits  we implemented a sales strategy in our company owned territories to sell multiple programs at higher hourly rates 
this strategy  in combination with improved marketing and enhanced financing options for our customers  led to higher same territory revenues in our company owned territories by significantly increasing average revenues per student despite a decrease in the number of absolute new enrollments per territory 
in subsequent periods as we have worked to achieve the optimal balance between program length and number of new enrollments 
in  same territory comparisons were negatively impacted by inflation in media rates that limited planned increases in advertising spending 
the media inflation that we encountered in was driven by a number of factors but primarily caused by record levels of television advertising spending for the national elections and the impact of olympic advertising during the summer games 
media inflation that limited systemwide increases in advertising spending resulted in a decline in inquiries for the year 
the success of conversion rate improvements and increases in student length of stay resulted in improvements in same territory performance in while addressing fluctuations in same territory revenues  we have focused attention on enhancing operating income in our company owned territories through improved labor management  cost containment and other operating efficiencies 
in our catapult learning segment  our long standing relationships with our institutional customers and the expansion of our service offerings have been the key drivers of our revenue growth 
although many of our contracts with institutional customers are school year contracts subject to annual renewal at the option of the institutional customer  we have had and continue to have high rates of repeat business in this segment 
for example  of our top clients based on revenue in our school services business line for the school year have renewed their contracts in each subsequent year and remain our clients through the school year 
these long standing relationships enable us to market additional services to existing customers without significant incremental sales and marketing expenses 
we anticipate that these high levels of contract retention will continue 
our total revenues have also increased due to selected acquisitions of businesses in addition to franchised territories 
in the learning center segment  our may acquisition of ivy west educational services  inc allows us to provide tutoring services for the sat and other standardized tests to students in their homes and in our sylvan learning centers 
in the catapult learning segment  our october acquisition of progressus therapy  a provider of speech  physical and occupational therapy to special needs students  allows us to extend the breadth of services we provide to our institutional customers 
in february  we acquired the stock of gateway learning corporation  which owns the hooked on phonics early reading  math and study skills programs 
we expect these businesses to contribute to revenue and operating income growth 

table of contents our revenue growth has led to growth in our operating income 
our operating margin has also increased as we have increased revenues per student  reduced costs  and increased scale 
in the future  our operating margin as a percentage of revenue may decline as we acquire franchise territories and recognize the full revenues and cost of these territories on a consolidated basis instead of recognizing franchise royalties alone 
in addition  as we introduce new programs  associated startup costs may temporarily depress our operating margin 
in  our same territory revenues grew modestly compared to the prior year in our learning center business 
while segment revenues grew by over due primarily to acquisitions  same territory revenues increased by 
inquiries declined from the prior year  and we did not achieve expected levels of revenue growth  especially at our company owned centers 
in response to these conditions the company has developed a three point strategy to restore growth management changes  designed to add strength while eliminating unneeded layers in the key company owned center portion of the team  implementation of new inquiry and enrollment conversion tools  and development of premium and value based programs 
our revenues and operating income are characterized by significant seasonal fluctuations 
see seasonality and other quarterly fluctuations below 
in order to properly motivate our employees  we have continued the practice of granting options to our key employees 
at the time of our formation  we granted options to purchase million shares of our common stock to members of our management team and other key employees 
during  we granted  shares of restricted common stock and options to acquire in the aggregate an additional  shares of common stock at prices less than the estimated fair value of our common stock 
therefore  during we incurred million in non cash stock compensation expense related to options and restricted common stock that vested immediately upon issuance 
we granted these shares of restricted common stock and options in recognition of the service of members of our management team leading up to the offering 
additionally  in the normal course of business we issued options to employees that will vest over a period of years 
the intrinsic value of options that vest over time are currently being expensed over the related vesting period  which resulted in million in non cash stock compensation in see notes and to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this form k 
we intend to make future grants of stock and stock options to our key employees 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
we operate through two business segments that offer distinct supplemental education services from which we earn revenues 
our learning center segment earns revenues principally by tutoring students in our company owned learning centers and from franchise services fees and through the sale of educational products 
our franchise services revenue consists principally of monthly franchise royalty fees  and also includes licensing fees for the sales of franchise territories 
net product sales consist of sales of the hooked on phonics and sylvan brands of products 
the hooked on phonics brand is sold both direct to the consumer and through retail establishments 
product revenues also include the sales of sylvan learning programs and related materials to franchised territories 
our catapult learning segment earns revenue principally from school year contracts to provide supplemental remedial services to public and non public schools 
our revenue recognition policies are discussed more fully in the section below entitled critical accounting policies and estimates and in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
in order to provide a more meaningful basis for comparison  we focus primarily on same territory revenue growth as this is the metric that best measures our success in reaching our customers in a specific geographical territory  particularly in light of our emphasis on providing convenient services to our customers which often requires increasing the locations of service delivery and expanding beyond the traditional learning center concept to provide specific instruction in temporary and shared use locations 
instructional and franchise operations costs 
our instructional and franchise operations costs include company owned territory operating costs  principally comprised of labor costs for instructors and center management personnel  facility rent expense and instructional materials and supplies 
we also include in this caption the costs of managing our extensive network of franchised territories  which consists principally of labor costs 
instructional costs associated with our catapult learning segment also consists primarily of labor costs to provide our services 
marketing and advertising 
we incur significant marketing and advertising costs to market our services to our customers in each segment 
these costs are expensed when incurred 

table of contents cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes the materials and production cost of inventory sold during the period as well as shipping and distribution costs of the products 
cost of goods sold also includes the amortization of the costs of computer software and media developed for sale to third parties 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are the expenses we record each period from depreciating our property and equipment over estimated useful lives that range from two to ten years 
we also amortize certain intangible assets that we acquired over periods not exceeding five years 
goodwill we recorded upon the acquisition of businesses is not amortized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses are general management and related administrative costs that we incur to manage our segments 
these costs consist of labor costs associated with our executive  accounting  human resource  legal and information technology staffs 
also included in general and administrative expenses are professional fees  insurance and rent associated with our centralized management functions 
we do not allocate our general and administrative expenses to our segments when determining segment profit 
interest expense 
interest expense consists principally of interest expense related to the debt that we incurred after we acquired our predecessor 
our predecessor did not incur significant interest expense as it financed its activities from cash flows from operations and capital contributions from laureate 
other financing costs 
other financing costs consist of previously deferred financing costs associated with obtaining debt financing that have been charged to expense upon the refinancing of the related debt or the determination that the debt financing will not be consummated 
income tax expense 
we incur income tax expense related to our consolidated domestic operations and our operations in europe that are taxed principally in germany 
our predecessor operated the online services portion of our learning center business through a subsidiary that filed separate income tax returns 
this subsidiary of our predecessor incurred significant operating losses that did not result in recorded income tax benefits for our predecessor because their realization was not reasonably assured 
consequently  the historical results of operations for our predecessor reflects unusually high effective income tax rates 
see the notes to the combined financial statements of our predecessor for additional information regarding the computation of our predecessor s income tax expense 
loss from discontinued operations 
on october   the company announced its intention to sell its education station business  which delivers site based no child left behind services to public schools 
education station is a component unit within the catapult learning operating segment 
existing education station contracts will be served and the company anticipates the completion of the sale within the next year 
the company is currently identifying interested buyers  and does not expect to incur a loss upon the sale of education station 
in september  the company sold its ownership interest in connections academy  inc to an ownership group including certain of our existing stockholders 
we will have no ongoing involvement with either business 
accordingly  we have classified the operating results of education station and connections academy as a separate component of our consolidated operating results in our financial statements and the financial statements of our predecessor for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about education station and connections academy and our accounting policies in connection with the sale of these businesses 
seasonality and other quarterly fluctuations the following table sets forth selected information related to seasonality and other quarterly fluctuations dollars in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues learning center catapult learning total revenues percentage of annual revenues operating income income from continuing operations 
table of contents like other companies that provide tutoring and other supplemental education services  we are subject to seasonality in our revenue streams that can affect our results of operations 
this seasonality arises from a number of factors  primarily driven by the timing of school semester cycles 
our quarterly results also have been affected by our license agreements with franchisees that require the payment of royalties to us based on a percentage of their cash receipts  a significant portion of which consist of prepayments by customers for services to be provided by our franchisees more than a month in the future 
first quarter 
in our learning center segment  we experience increased enrollments as a result of the initiation of advertising and increased parental focus on their children s performance associated with the receipt of academic results from the first part of the school year 
our royalties increase as our franchisees begin to receive advance payment for services to be provided during the summer 
in our products business  we believe that we may experience a slowdown in revenue due to possible softness in sales in the post holiday period of our retail customers 
in our catapult learning segment  we deliver services under nclb and other programs during this quarter 
second quarter 
in our learning center segment  we experience a higher level of revenues as we benefit from our continued investment in advertising  delivery of services in our company owned territories and increased receipts of franchise royalties due to prepayment for summer programs 
in our catapult learning segment  we complete delivery of our institutional services in conjunction with the ending of the school year 
third quarter 
the third quarter marks the peak delivery of services in our learning center segment 
we recognize revenue as we deliver these services in our company owned territories 
however  with respect to our franchised territories  our royalties decline as the cash receipts our franchisees receive from their customers decline from peak second quarter levels 
due to summer vacation  we provide limited services in our catapult learning segment during this period  which results in the lowest segment revenue for the year 
however  we gain significant visibility for the upcoming year because the majority of our institutional contracts are renewed during the third quarter 
fourth quarter 
in our learning center segment  enrollments are at their lowest levels of the year as a result of lower advertising expenditures  students taking a greater number of vacations during the holiday season and parental optimism towards their children s improved school performance associated with the beginning of a new school year 
in addition  we experience lower revenues from franchise royalties in the fourth quarter as a result of prepayments by our franchisees customers in earlier quarters 
in our products business  we believe that we may experience relatively higher revenues in this quarter due to restocking by our retail customers in expectation of higher sales during the holiday period 
the period reflects increased revenues in catapult learning as schools are back in session and programs begin 
the fourth quarter reflects a higher proportion of costs within catapult learning as investment in start up activity is incurred 
other 
the timing of school year services  advertising spending  critical enrollment periods  and new product introductions can affect our revenues at any time during the year 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be a fair indicator and should not be relied upon as a measure of our future performance 
unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income year ended december  on june   we acquired substantially all of the pre k business of laureate  our predecessor 
the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  is derived from our consolidated statement of income for the period from june  date of inception through december  and the unaudited combined statement of income of predecessor for the six months ended june   adjusted to give effect to the acquisition as if it occurred as of january  the pro forma adjustments are described below and have been determined in accordance with sec regulations for the presentation of pro forma financial information following a business combination

revenues 
the increase in revenue during the year ended december  of million compared to the same period of the prior year was due to growth in the learning center segment of million  partially offset by a decline of million in the catapult learning segment 
the acquisitions of sylvan learning centers from franchisees was the primary reason for the increase of million in company owned center revenue over last year 
net product sales grew million due to the acquisition of hooked on phonics line of educational programs and increased sales of existing product lines 
european revenues increased million and franchise services revenues declined by million over the prior year 
in the catapult learning segment  the school services and special needs businesses revenues decreased million compared to the prior year 
learning center revenues from company owned territories increased approximately million primarily as a result of the acquisition of franchised territories during net product sales grew million primarily as a result of the acquisition of hooked on phonics programs and services  which we acquired during the first quarter of as well as an increase in sales of educational programs to franchisees compared to last year 

table of contents due to the decrease in the number of franchisee owned territories  which is a result of our acquisitions during exceeding new franchise territory openings  franchise services revenues declined by million over the prior year 
european revenues  which include both company owned and franchise territory results  increased million primarily due to increased enrollment 
foreign currency exchange rate movements had minimal impact on revenues 
revenues for the learning center segment represented of our total revenues for the year ended december  catapult learning our school services and special needs revenues decreased million due to the expiration and planned non renewal of several non strategic contracts  reduced staffing availability of speech therapists in the school year  and the non funding of certain one time summer school programs that were served in the prior year

segment costs also increased due to the acquisition of the hooked on phonics line of educational programs and the launch of online tutorial services to customers through the learning center network 
during we also increased our investment in the development of new programs to meet market needs for convenient educational services and programs 
european expenses related to sch lerhilfe increased by million primarily due to higher costs to support revenue growth 
foreign currency exchange rate movements had minimal impact on expenses compared to the prior year 

table of contents catapult learning costs decreased by million  or in compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in variable costs related to the decline in school services and special needs revenues during the year 
segment operating margin 
learning center segment operating margins decreased in the year ended december  to compared to for the prior year 
the decreased margin is primarily related to additional costs associated with operating and integrating additional company owned territories acquired and the related shift in revenue mix from franchise revenues to company owned territory revenues 
this occurs because the operating income from an acquired territory is comparable to the royalty income earned from a franchisee in the year of acquisition although the revenue recorded increases substantially 
the margin decline is also due to the increased investment in program development costs intended to increase future revenues 
catapult learning segment operating margins were for the year ended december   compared to from the prior year 
this margin decline is primarily due to the loss of certain summer school programs served in the prior year as well as the negative impact of hurricane katrina which caused the closure of numerous schools in new orleans where catapult had been scheduled to provide services 
corporate expenses 
corporate general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  and million during the same period of the decrease in the amount of these expenses of million is due to the recording of million of non cash stock compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in related to restricted common stock and options granted to employees and directors to purchase common stock at prices less than the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the remaining increase of million is in response to needs to support the expanding business and to operate as a public company 
net interest expense decreased by million primarily as a result of the refinancing of senior debt in april  the payoff of the seller note in april of  and repayment in september of a portion of our term loan facility with the proceeds from our initial public offering  offset partially by an increase in short term interest rates and borrowings on the revolving credit line under the facility 
other financing costs decreased million due to a terminated financing transaction in our income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to higher pretax earnings in  offset partially by a higher effective tax rate in our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decrease in the full year effective tax rate in was primarily due to the recording of stock compensation expense in that resulted in a permanently lower income tax deduction compared to the related compensation expense recorded for financial statement purposes

table of contents revenues 
our revenue increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of progressus therapy  the expansion of company owned learning center territories  and franchised center royalty growth 
learning center revenues from company owned territories increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of company owned territories  which contributed million and the launch of a new third party financing program during june  which made financing available to a broader range of potential customers 
franchise services revenues increased million as a result of the addition of a net six franchised territories 
additionally  our combined same territory revenue growth increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in same territory revenue growth was below historical levels  primarily because our advertising expenditures were less efficient at reaching our target audience due to unexpectedly high media rates

net interest expense in declined million  primarily as a result of refinancing the senior term loan and repayment of the subordinated note payable to laureate 
upon replacement of the senior term loan  million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and other financing costs related to terminated financing transaction were expensed 
foreign exchange gains of million in were due to the settlement or remeasurement of long term obligations of our german subsidiary that were denominated in dollars 
income from continuing operations decreased in the period due to increased segment profits offset by increases in non recurring corporate expenses 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended compared to for the year ended due to permanent differences between income tax and financial reporting amounts of non cash stock compensation 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes major changes in our cash position during the years ending december  december  dollars in millions beginning cash balance operating activities continuing operations operating activities discontinued operations investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates ending cash balance historically  we have generated significant cash flows from our operations which have allowed us to meet our working capital needs and fund the cash we require to make investments in property and equipment  open new company owned learning center territories  and acquire franchised territories and other businesses 
our working capital requirements are favorably impacted by the fact that in our largest segment  the learning center segment  operations generate positive working capital even during growth periods 
in our learning center business  customers must pay in advance of services  which contributes to our cash position 
company owned territories benefit from customer prepayment and  in connection with franchised territories  we receive royalty payments from franchisees based upon net cash collected in the prior month 
our working capital needs are greater in our catapult learning segment because our customers are primarily public school districts that pay us in arrears  often days or longer after we perform our services 
for the years ended december  and december   our cash flows from continuing operations were million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million was attributed primarily to cash used to fund working capital changes  partially offset by an increase in income from continuing operations before non cash charges of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the reported income from continuing operations for the year ended december  included significant non cash elements such as deferred income taxes of million resulting primarily from tax benefits related to tax basis goodwill amortization  as well as depreciation and amortization of million 
the cash used to fund working capital changes of million relative to the same period of consisted of increased investments in accounts receivable and other current assets of million  increased investments in non current assets of million  combined with reduced funding from current liabilities of million 
cash used in discontinued operations was million in compared to million in our investing activities have historically consisted of investments in property and equipment and acquisitions of franchised territories and other businesses 
our ability to make future acquisitions and investments in property and equipment will be dependent on the cash flows we generate from our operations and our ability to obtain additional capital 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash to acquire gateway learning corporation  net of cash acquired 
we invested an additional million in learning center acquisitions and million in property and equipment and internally developed software 
as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  on april   we amended our term loan facility  increasing the term loans outstanding from million at march  to million 
the revolving credit borrowings of million were immediately repaid  and the remaining million was available for use in operations  acquisitions or other investments 
as a result of the borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility and outstanding standby letters of credit  we had million of available credit through that facility as of december  we are in compliance with all of our covenants under our term loan facility as of december  certain of the financial covenants become more restrictive for the quarterly measurement dates  and we will likely not achieve the necessary levels under the facility as of march  we and the bank group are currently negotiating the terms of a new credit facility amendment  which will provide revised financial covenants and other term modifications 
we expect that the credit facility amendment will close prior to march  we believe that cash flows from operations  available cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements  including expansion of our existing business  acquisition of centers  funding of program and software development and operating costs 
table of contents for the next year 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  territory and other acquisitions and new company owned center development  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing programs and products 
we expect that we will  from time to time  continue to consider opportunities in the educational services industry for potential acquisitions of companies that complement our overall business strategy 
contingent matters the following tables reflect our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total and after dollars in millions contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases shared services agreement total contractual cash obligations calculated on scheduled outstanding long term debt amounts using applicable fixed rate or interest rate in effect at december  for variable rate loans 
other commercial commitments amount committed guarantees expiring in standby letters of credit expiring in standby letters of credit expiring in total commercial commitments we have guaranteed a bank loan of the sylvan national advertising fund  which is a separate legal entity that the company does not control  in the amount of million  which expires in we have guaranteed certain bank loans of franchisees related to financing the purchase of educational programs and other purchased instructional material 
of the million of available credit under this program  million was outstanding at december  these guarantees are secured by the assets of the business of the individual franchisee utilizing this financing arrangement 
the company maintains a number of standby letters of credit totaling million as of december  to guarantee its insurance program and the potential payment under a franchisee acquisition through the company also has other obligations recorded within long term liabilities of million that have no specified payment dates 
international exposure our learning center segment has operations outside the united states  primarily in germany and canada 
these international operations subject us to political uncertainties  currency devaluations and national regulations affecting the provision of educational services 
accordingly  our revenues and income in any period may be impacted by international developments outside our control 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  intangible assets and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition learning center revenues from our learning center segment consist predominately of fees we earn from providing educational services to students through company owned learning centers and royalties we collect from our franchised learning centers 
fees for the services we provide in company owned centers are based on the number and type of sessions that students purchase  and we recognize these fees as we deliver the sessions 
students often prepay us for multiple sessions that they purchase  and we record any undelivered sessions as deferred revenue 
these prepayments are refunded if at a later date the student notifies us that the prepaid sessions will not be used 
sales of educational products and materials to customers and franchisees is recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer to the buyer  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based on contractual terms 
revenue is net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
franchisees pay us a monthly royalty fee based on their cash receipts  which are based on the number and type of sessions that students purchase 
we recognize these fees in the month they are earned if collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of royalties earned based on periodic business updates from our franchisees and extensive historical data we maintain of monthly royalties reported by each franchised learning center 
we record these royalties as revenue and accounts receivable at each balance sheet date and later make adjustments to the actual amounts when officially reported by our franchisees  generally within fifteen days after the month earned 
catapult learning revenues from our catapult learning segment consist principally of revenues from arrangements with school districts receiving funds under federal and state based programs to provide supplemental education services 
these arrangements typically have terms of one year or less 
for arrangements that specify a fixed fee per student for services over a stated period  we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service period  because our services are provided in approximately equal proportions over the contract term 
other arrangements in this segment provide for fees payable to us for services on an hourly basis at a specified hourly rate 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements as we deliver the services 
allowances for accounts receivable our assets include receivables from franchisees related to royalties and product sales which are collected typically in less than one month and receivables from schools districts which typically have a collection cycle in excess of days 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we calculate the allowance based on a specific analysis of past due balances and also consider historical trends of write offs 
we review our past due balances monthly and write off those that are deemed uncollectible 
actual collection experience has not differed significantly from our estimates  due primarily to credit and collections practices and the financial strength of our customers 
accounts and notes receivable balances due from franchisees are secured by the assets of the franchisee s business 
other accounts receivable balances  primarily due from governmental agencies  product distributors and retailers  are not collateralized 
sales of educational products to retailers and product distributors generally allow the customer to return the product for a full refund or credit 
the company provides a sales allowance against accounts receivable to estimate the value of products that will be returned and to state accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
the allowance is calculated based upon historical return experience giving specific consideration to customer type and product maturity 
amortization of intangibles and indefinite lived assets at december   our total assets included approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets  representing approximately of our net assets 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of the pre k business of laureate on june  
table of contents our intangible assets include million of franchise rights and tradenames that have an indefinite life 
we determined that these assets have an indefinite life because there are no significant legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that limit the useful life 
in addition  we determined that the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors are not factors that are expected to significantly affect the useful life of the assets 
our sylvan franchise license agreements license to each franchisee the exclusive right to operate sylvan learning center in a specified territory for an initial term of ten years 
the franchise license agreements are known as evergreen agreements  because each franchisee may renew its license for no additional fee for consecutive ten year terms 
the franchisee may also transfer the license to a third party with our consent  which may not be unreasonably withheld  for a nominal fee 
we are not aware of any franchise license agreement that was not renewed on the renewal date  and  historically  the average failure rate of our franchisees has been less than per year 
because of the evergreen provisions of our franchise license agreements  our substantial experience with renewals  and the very low failure rate associated with our franchisee population  we have determined that the life of our franchise license agreements is indefinite 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment annually on october of each year  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the impairment test requires the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to the difference  and the intangible asset is then carried at its new fair value 
fair value is determined using estimates of discounted cash flows 
the fair values of our sylvan learning center franchise rights and tradenames are determined based on estimates of future royalties that we expect to receive from the franchised learning centers we acquired on june   discounted using the rate of return required for investments of like risk 
estimates of future royalties that we will earn likely will change over time as we perform our impairment assessments 
even if the estimate of future royalties does not decrease  the fair value of these assets may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the applicable discount rate 
in addition  if we experience unexpected franchisee attrition  we may determine that our sylvan franchise license rights do not have an indefinite life and should be subsequently amortized over their remaining estimated useful life 
at december   we had million of goodwill 
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of a business we acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but rather review its carrying value for impairment annually on october of each year  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
under the first step  we determine the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
the reporting units for purposes of the impairment test are our major operating subsidiaries  as these are the components of the business for which discrete financial information is available and our segment managers regularly review the operating results of those components 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by estimating the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows  and then compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered potentially impaired and the second step is completed in order to measure the impairment loss 
under the second step  we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
currently  of our goodwill is included in our learning center segment  which is our most profitable and stable reporting segment 
if the estimated cash flows from the reporting units comprising our learning center segment were to decline  due to the effects of increased competition or reduced demand or other factors  we could incur a material goodwill impairment charge 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of statement statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r was originally required to be adopted no later than july  on april  the sec announced that non small business registrants would not be required to adopt statement r until the first fiscal year beginning after june  which effectively extended the adoption deadline for the company to january  the company adopted the standard on january  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date  or 
table of contents a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of proforma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of statement r using the modified prospective method 
unvested stock based awards issued prior to may  and disclosed in the financial statements using the minimum value method rather than the estimated fair value using the black scholes option pricing model will be accounted for at the date of adoption using the intrinsic value method originally applied to those awards 
awards issued after may  and through december  that have not vested will be accounted for at the date of adoption using the same estimate of the grant date fair value disclosed in the historical financial statements 
as permitted by statement  the company historically accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  recognized no compensation cost when employee stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method may have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on our financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend significantly on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
assuming no stock option grants in  the company estimates that the pro forma amount disclosed in will slightly exceed the amount to be recognized in because no future expense will be recognized for options granted prior to may  which had no intrinsic value 
see also note  stock based compensation 
cash retained as a result of excess tax benefits relating to share based payments will be presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows 
previously  the cash retained from excess tax benefits was presented in operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside the united states 
most of this business is transacted through international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize the exchange rate exposure of our operating margins 
a hypothetical adverse change in average annual foreign currency movements would have decreased both net income and cash flows for the year ended december  by million 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
we generally view our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical average change in depreciation in functional currencies relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december  interest rate risk we hold cash and cash equivalents in high quality  short term  fixed income securities 
consequently  the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuance of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper 
we currently have interest rate swaps in place to reduce interest rate volatility associated with our secured credit facility  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides information on our significant indebtedness and our interest rate swap agreements 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at december  was million  representing a settlement asset of million 
assuming average variable rate debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in the year ended december  
table of contents all the potential impacts noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
