fcd customers fcd s customer mix spans across several industries  including the chemical  petroleum  power  water and general service industries 
fcd s product mix includes original equipment  aftermarket parts and services 
fcd competition while in recent years the valve market has undergone a significant amount of consolidation  in relative terms  the market remains highly fragmented 
some of the largest valve industry competitors include crane co  dresser inc  emerson  kitz and tyco 
our assessments show that the top global valve manufacturers collectively comprise approximately of the valve market 
based on independent industry sources we believe that we are the third largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis 
we believe that our comprehensive portfolio of valve products and services  our focus on 
table of contents execution and our competency in severe corrosion and erosion applications are key sources of our competitive advantage 
fcd backlog fcd s backlog of orders at december  was million  compared with million on december  we expect to ship approximately of our backlog on december  during flow solutions division through fsd  we design  manufacture and distribute mechanical seals  sealing systems and parts  and provide related services  principally to process industries 
flow control products require mechanical seals to be replaced throughout the products useful lives 
the replacement of mechanical seals is an integral part of our aftermarket services 
our mechanical seals are used on a variety of rotating equipment  including pumps  mixers  compressors  steam turbines and other specialty equipment  primarily in the petroleum  natural gas  chemical processing  mineral and ore processing and general industrial end markets 
we manufacture mechanical seals at three plants in the us and at four plants outside the us through our global network of quick response centers qrcs  we provide service  repair and diagnostic services for maintaining components of flow control systems 
our mechanical seal products are primarily marketed to end users through our direct sales force and  on a commission basis  to distributors and sales agents 
a portion of our mechanical seal products is sold directly to original equipment manufacturers oems for incorporation into rotating equipment requiring mechanical seals 
fsd products we design  manufacture and distribute approximately different models of mechanical seals and sealing systems 
we believe our ability to deliver engineered new seal product orders within hours from the customer s request through design  engineering  manufacturing  testing and delivery  provides us with a leading competitive advantage 
mechanical seals are critical to the reliable operation of rotating equipment for prevention of leakage and emissions of hazardous substances and the reduction of shaft wear caused by non mechanical seals 
we also manufacture a gas lubricated mechanical seal that is used in high speed compressors for gas transmission and in the oil and gas production markets 
we continually update our mechanical seals and sealing systems to integrate emerging technologies

approximately of our service work is performed on a quick response basis  and we offer hour service in all of our major markets 
fsd new product development our investments in new product research and development focus on developing longer lasting and more efficient products and value added services 
approximately of our original equipment mechanical seal sales for consisted of products developed within the past five years 
in addition to numerous product upgrades  our recent mechanical seal and seal system innovations include light hydrocarbon seal  batch chemical process seal  improved split seal for water markets  high pressure gas compressor seal  large diameter compressor seal  and strengthened mineral and ore processing seal 
we also market flowstar 
net  an interactive tool used to actively monitor and manage information relative to equipment performance 
flowstar 
net enhances our customers ability to make informed decisions and respond quickly to plant production problems  extend the life of their production equipment and lower maintenance expenses 
none of these newly developed seal products required the investment of a material amount of our assets or was otherwise material 
fsd customers our mechanical seal products and systems are sold directly to end users and to oems for incorporation into pumps  compressors  mixers or other rotating equipment requiring mechanical seals 
our mechanical seal sales are diversified among several industries  including petroleum  natural gas  chemical  mineral and ore processing and general industries 
fsd competition we compete against a number of manufacturers in the sale of mechanical seals 
among our largest global mechanical seal competitors are john crane  a unit of smiths group plc 
and eagle burgmann  a joint venture of two traditional global seal manufacturers 
based on independent industry sources  we believe that we are the second largest industrial mechanical seals supplier in the world 
our ability to quickly manufacture customers requests for engineered seal products  from design to engineering  manufacturing  testing and delivery  is a major competitive advantage 
fsd backlog fsd s backlog of orders at december  was million  compared with million at december  we expect to ship approximately our fsd backlog on december  during general business competition despite the consolidation trend over the past years  the markets for our products are highly competitive  with competition occurring on the basis of price  technical expertise  timeliness of delivery  contractual terms  previous installation history and reputation for quality and reliability 
timeliness of delivery  quality and the proximity of service centers are important considerations for our aftermarket products and services 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide a quick response  customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  aftermarket competition for standard products has increased 
price competition tends to be more significant for oems than aftermarket services and generally has been increasing 
in the aftermarket portion of our service business  we compete against large and well established national or global competitors and  in some markets  against smaller regional and local companies  as well as the in house maintenance departments of our end user customers 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and valves  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
in the petroleum industry  the competitors for aftermarket services tend to be the customers own in house capabilities 
in other industries  except the nuclear power industry  the competitors for aftermarket services tend to be local independent repair shops 
low cost replicators of spare parts are competitors for spare parts for all industries except for the nuclear power industry 
we 
table of contents possess certain competitive advantages in the nuclear power industry due to our n stamp  a prerequisite to serve customers in that industry  and our considerable base of proprietary knowledge 
generally  our customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase  thereby reducing the size and diversity of their inventory 
although vendor reduction programs could adversely affect our business  we have been successful in entering into global arrangements with a number of customers to leverage competitive advantages 
our ability to use our portfolio of products and solutions to meet customer demands is a competitive strength 
we continue to explore and develop potential new solutions  as well as products pumps  valves  and seals  with our customers to improve service opportunities and increase our market share 
new product development we spent approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively  on research and development initiatives 
our research and development group consists of engineers involved in new product development and improvement of existing products 
additionally  we sponsor consortium programs for research with various universities and jointly conduct limited development work with certain vendors  licensees and customers 
we believe current expenditures are adequate to sustain our ongoing research and development activities 
customers we sell to a wide variety of customers in the oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water treatment and general industries 
no individual customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues 
we are not required to carry unusually high amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements 
we have been working to increase our overall inventory efficiency to improve our operational effectiveness and to reduce working capital needs 
we generally do not provide rights of product return for our customers and do not offer extended payment terms 
selling and distribution we primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions  industries or products 
in addition  we use distributors and sales agents to supplement our direct sales force in countries where business practices or customs make it appropriate  or wherever it is not economical to have direct sales staff 
we generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors  customers and prospects or through referrals 
intellectual property we own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the name and design of our products 
we consider our trademarks and patents to be an important aspect of our business 
in addition  our pool of proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets related to the design  manufacture and operation of our products  is considered particularly important and valuable 
accordingly  we attempt to proactively protect such proprietary information 
we generally own the rights to the products which we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by any license or franchise to operate 
our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use  whereas our existing patents generally expire years from the dates they were filed  which has occurred at various times in the past 
we do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent s will have a material adverse impact on our operations 
raw materials the principal raw materials used in manufacturing of our products are readily available and include bar stock and structural steel  castings  fasteners  gaskets  motors  silicon and carbon faces and fluoropolymer components 
while substantially all raw materials are purchased from outside sources  we have been able to obtain an adequate 
table of contents supply and anticipate no shortages of such materials 
we continue to expand worldwide sourcing to capitalize on low cost sources of purchased goods 
we are a vertically integrated manufacturer of certain pump and valve products 
certain corrosion resistant castings for our pumps and quarter turn valves are manufactured at our foundries 
other metal castings are either manufactured at our foundries or purchased from outside sources 
we also use highly engineered corrosion resistant plastic parts for certain pump and valve product lines 
these include rotomolding as well as injection and compression molding of a variety of fluoropolymer and other plastic materials 
we do not anticipate difficulty in obtaining raw materials in the future 
suppliers of raw materials for nuclear markets must be qualified by the american society of mechanical engineers and  accordingly  are limited in number 
however  to date we have experienced no significant difficulty in obtaining such materials 
employees and labor relations we have approximately  employees globally 
a portion of the hourly employees at our pump manufacturing plant located in vernon  california  our pump service center located in cleveland  ohio  our valve manufacturing plant located in lynchburg  virginia and our foundry located in dayton  ohio  are represented by unions 
additionally  some employees at select facilities in the following countries are unionized or have employee works councils argentina  australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  finland  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory  including those employees represented by unions and works councils 
no unionized facility produces more than of our revenues 
we entered into new multi year collective bargaining agreements with our unions in cleveland and vernon in environmental regulations and proceedings we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we have operating facilities 
these requirements primarily relate to the generation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  air emissions and waste water discharges 
we periodically make capital expenditures to abate and control pollution and to satisfy environmental requirements 
at present  we have no plans for any material capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at any of our facilities 
however  we have incurred and continue to incur operating costs relating to ongoing environmental compliance matters  although certain costs have been reduced by successful waste minimization programs 
based on existing and proposed environmental requirements and our anticipated production schedule  we believe that future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in most of our manufacturing and foundry operations 
many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes and may require some clean up of historical contamination 
during the due diligence phase of our acquisitions  we conduct environmental site assessments in an attempt to determine any potential environmental liability and to identify the need for clean up 
we are currently conducting follow up investigation and or remediation activities at those locations where we have known environmental concerns 
we have cleaned up a majority of the sites with known historical contamination and we are addressing the remaining identified issues 
over the years  we have been involved as one of many potentially responsible parties prp at former public waste disposal sites that are or were subject to investigation and remediation 
we are currently involved as a prp at four superfund sites 
the sites are in various stages of evaluation by government authorities 
our total projected fair share cost allocation at all four of these sites is expected to be less than  we have established reserves that we believe to be adequate to cover our currently identified on site and off site environmental liabilities 

table of contents exports our export sales from the us to foreign unaffiliated customers were million in  million in and million in licenses are required from us government agencies to export certain products 
in particular  products with nuclear applications are restricted  as are certain other pump  valve and mechanical seal products 
we are responding to an sec investigation regarding the past sales of goods and services that certain foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through during the united nations oil for food program 
in an apparently related action  one of our foreign subsidiary s operations is cooperating with a foreign governmental investigation of that site s involvement in the united nations oil for food program 
we are continuing fully cooperate in both the sec and the foreign investigations 
both investigations are in progress but  at this point  are incomplete 
see item legal proceedings for more information 
we have also initiated a process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control laws and regulations and  if applicable  disclose to the applicable us governmental authorities  any past potential violations of the us export control laws

risk factors 
any of the events discussed as risk factors below may occur 
if they do  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
in connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section of sarbanes oxley  we identified material weaknesses in our internal control 
we have taken measures to strengthen our internal control in response to the previously identified material weaknesses  including by implementing strengthened control procedures for information technology infrastructure  enhancing company level monitoring controls processes and expanding our internal audit and corporate compliance functions  and engaged outside consultants to assist us in our efforts 
for a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weaknesses and of the steps that we have taken to remediate these and previously identified material weaknesses  see item a 
controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
while we have taken measures to strengthen our internal control in response to the previously identified material weaknesses  including by implementing strengthened control procedures for information technology infrastructure  enhancing company level monitoring controls processes and expanding our internal audit and corporate compliance functions  and engaged outside consultants to assist us in our efforts  additional work remains to be done to address the identified material weaknesses 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal control as our business evolves or to integrate acquired businesses into our controls system  we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures  we could be subject to  among other things  regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec and the nyse  including a delisting from the nyse  securities litigation  events of default under our new credit facilities  debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals  and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the valuation of our common stock 
furthermore  there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of controls and procedures  including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures 
we could face additional litigation exposure and a greater likelihood of an sec enforcement or nyse regulatory action if further restatements were to occur or other accounting related problems emerge 
in addition  any future restatements or other accounting related problems may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley  our business prospects and stock valuation could be adversely affected 
section of sarbanes oxley of requires our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
this legislation is relatively new  and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements 
we expended significant resources to comply with our obligations under section with respect to and if we are unable to comply with our obligations under section in the future or experience delays in future reports of our management and outside auditors on our internal control over financial reporting  or if we fail to respond timely to any changes in the section requirements  we may be unable to timely file with the sec our annual or periodic reports and may be subject to  among other things  regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec and the nyse  including delisting from the nyse  securities litigation  events of default under our new credit 
table of contents facilities  debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the valuation of our common stock 
we are currently subject to securities class action litigation  the unfavorable outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a number of putative class action lawsuits have been filed against us  certain of our former officers  our independent auditors and the lead underwriters of our most recent public stock offerings  alleging securities laws violations 
we believe that these lawsuits  which have been consolidated  are without merit and are vigorously defending them and have notified our applicable insurers 
we cannot  however  determine with certainty the outcome or resolution of these claims or the timing for their resolution 
the consolidated securities case is currently set for trial on march  in addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending this litigation and any damages that we may suffer  our management s efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations in order to address these claims 
if the final resolution of this litigation is unfavorable to us  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows might be materially adversely affected if our existing insurance coverage is unavailable or inadequate to resolve the matter 
the ongoing sec and foreign government investigation regarding our participation in the united nations oil for food program could materially adversely affect our company 
on february   we received a subpoena from the sec regarding goods and services that certain foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through during the united nations oil for food program 
this investigation includes a review of whether any inappropriate payments were made to iraqi officials in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act 
the investigation includes periods prior to  as well as subsequent to our acquisition of the foreign operations involved in the investigation 
we may be subject to liabilities if violations are found regardless of whether they relate to periods before or subsequent to our acquisition 
in addition  one of our foreign subsidiary s operations is cooperating with a foreign governmental investigation of that site s involvement in the united nations oil for food program 
this cooperation has included responding to an investigative trip by foreign authorities to the foreign subsidiary s site  providing relevant documentation to these authorities and answering their questions 
we are unable to predict how or if the foreign authorities will pursue this matter in the future 
we believe that both the sec and this foreign authority are investigating other companies from their actions arising from the oil for food program 
we are in the process of reviewing and responding to the sec subpoena and assessing the implications of the foreign investigation  including the continuation of a thorough internal investigation 
our investigation is in the early stages and has included and will include a detailed review of contracts with the iraqi government during the period in question and certain payments associated therewith 
additionally  we have and will continue to conduct interviews with employees with knowledge of the contracts and payments in question 
we are in the early phases of our internal investigation and as a result are unable to make any definitive determination whether any inappropriate payments were made and accordingly are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
we will continue to fully cooperate in both the sec and the foreign investigations 
both investigations are in progress but  at this point  are incomplete 
accordingly  if the sec and or the foreign authorities take enforcement action with regard to these investigations  we may be required to pay fines  consent to injunctions against future conduct or suffer other penalties which could potentially materially impact our business financial statements and cash flows 
potential noncompliance with us export control laws could materially adversely affect our business 
we have notified applicable us governmental authorities of our plans to investigate  analyze and  if applicable  disclose past potential violations of the us export control laws through  in general  the export of products  services and technologies without the licenses possibly required by such authorities 
if and to the extent 
table of contents violations are identified  confirmed and so disclosed  we could be subject to substantial fines and other penalties affecting our ability to do business outside the united states 
the internal revenue service irs is auditing our tax returns  and a negative outcome of the audit would require us to make additional tax payments that may be material 
we have recently concluded an irs audit of our us federal income tax returns for the years through based on its audit work  the irs has issued proposed adjustments to increase taxable income during through by million  and to deny foreign tax credits of million in the aggregate 
the tax liability resulting from these proposed adjustments will be offset with foreign tax credit carryovers and other refund claims  and therefore should not result in a material future cash payment  pending final review by the joint committee on taxation 
we anticipate this review will be completed by december  the effect of the adjustments to current and deferred taxes has been reflected in previously filed financial statements 
during  the irs will commence an audit of our us federal income tax returns for the years through while we expect that the upcoming irs audit will be similar in scope to the recently completed examination  the upcoming audit may be broader 
furthermore  the preliminary results from the audit of through are not indicative of the future result of the audit of through the audit of through may result in additional tax payments by us  the amount of which may be material  but will not be known until that irs audit is finalized 
in the course of the tax audit for the years through  we have identified record keeping and other material internal control weaknesses  which caused us to incur significant expense to substantiate our tax return items and address information and document requests made by the irs 
we expect to incur similar expenses in future periods with respect to the upcoming irs audit of the years through due to the record keeping issues referred to above  the irs has issued a notice of inadequate records for the years through and may issue a similar notice for the years through while the irs has agreed not to assess penalties for inadequacy of records with respect to the years through  no assurances can be made that the irs will not seek to assess such penalties or other types of penalties with respect to the years through such penalties could result in a material impact to the consolidated results of operations 
additionally  the record keeping issues noted above may result in future us state and local tax assessments of tax  penalties and interest which could have a material impact to the consolidated results of operations 
the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future could affect our operating results 
we currently have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carry forwards  net operating losses  and other deductible temporary differences which are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on our assessment of our deferred tax assets  we determined  based on projected future income and certain available tax planning strategies  that million of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is currently required for this portion of our deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized  we will be required to record an additional valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and our operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made 
we operate and manage our business on a number of different computer systems  including several aging enterprise resource planning erp systems that rely on manual processes  which could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we operate and manage our business on a number of different computer systems  including disparate legacy systems inherited from our predecessors 
some of our computer systems  as well as some of our computer hardware  are aging and contain inefficient processes 
for example  several of our older erp systems rely on manual processes  which are generally labor intensive and increase the risk of error 
furthermore  as discussed below under item a 
controls and procedures  as of the end of  we did not maintain adequate information technology 
table of contents general controls  as our information technology general controls supporting restricted access to financial applications  programs and data 
unless we are able to enhance our computer systems generally and information technology general controls specifically  our ability to identify  capture and communicate pertinent information may be compromised  which in turn may compromise our ability to timely and accurately report our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
economic  political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our operations is conducted and located outside the us we have manufacturing or service facilities in countries and sell to customers in over countries  in addition to the united states 
moreover  we outsource certain of our manufacturing and engineering functions to  and source our raw materials and components from china  eastern europe  india  latin america and mexico 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  instability in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets and the middle east  trade protection measures  such as tariff increases  and import and export licensing and control requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems  differing and  in some cases  more stringent labor regulations  partial or total expropriation  differing protection of intellectual property  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  inability to repatriate income or capital  and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies  which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures 
for example  political unrest and a two month nation wide work stoppage in venezuela in negatively impacted demand for our products from customers in that country and other customers  such as us oil refineries  that were affected by the resulting disruption in the supply of crude oil 
similarly  the military conflict in the middle east softened the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services in that region  notwithstanding the historically high prices for oil 
additionally we are investigating or have investigated certain allegations regarding foreign management engaging in unethical practices prohibited by our code of business conduct which could have inappropriately benefited them at company expense 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies  as a significant portion of our revenue  and certain of our costs  assets and liabilities  are denominated in currencies other than us dollar 
the primary foreign currencies to which we have exposure are the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen  singapore dollar  brazilian real  australian dollar  argentinean peso and venezuelan bolivar 
certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure  such as the argentinean peso  have undergone significant devaluation in the past 
although we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge our risks associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies  no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our international operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and regulations issued by the us customs service  the bureau of industry and security  various foreign governmental agencies  including applicable customs  currency exchange control and transfer pricing 
table of contents regulations and various programs administered by the united nations 
no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with  or be able to detect violations of  any such laws or regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
we have notified applicable us governmental authorities of our plans to conduct a voluntary thorough audit of our compliance with the us export control laws and  if applicable  make a voluntary self disclosure of any potential violations identified  as applicable 
if violations are identified  then such disclosure could result in substantial fines and other penalties 
in order to manage our day to day operations  we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices 
in addition  we are required to create compensation programs  employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries 
we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network 
our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
any of these factors could  however  adversely affect our international operations and  consequently  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may be unable to deliver our backlog on time which could affect our future sales and profitability and our relationships with customers 
at december   backlog reached million  a record level for the company 
in  our bookings and backlog have continued to increase through  at least march  our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for backlog is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  sufficient manufacturing plant capacity  access to the raw materials and other inventory required for production  an adequately trained and capable workforce  project engineering expertise for certain large projects  and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources 
many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times and contain penalty clauses related to on time delivery 
failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to financial penalties  may result in damage to existing customer relationships  could negatively impact our financial performance  and potentially cause adverse changes in the market price of our outstanding common stock 
our business depends on the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers  which in turn are affected by the cyclical nature of their markets and their liquidity 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the levels of capital expenditures by our customers depend  in turn  on the general economic conditions and conditions in their industry  as well as on their liquidity 
the businesses of many of our customers  particularly general industrial companies  chemical companies and oil refineries  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
our customers in these industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects  including expensive maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
for example  demand for our products and services from our general industrial customers  such as steel and pulp and paper manufacturers  was negatively impacted by the us recession in the early part of this decade 
similarly  in response to high oil and natural gas prices and a weak demand for their products due to the soft economy  during the past several years our chemical customers reduced their spending on capital investments and operated their facilities at lower levels  reducing demand for our products and services 
some of our customers may delay capital maintenance even during favorable conditions in their markets 
for example  while high oil prices generally spur demand for our products and services in upstream petroleum markets  they often reduce demand for our products and services from oil refineries  as refiners seek to take advantage of favorable margins by operating at high levels of capacity utilization and deferring maintenance 

table of contents the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industry 
for example  despite high natural gas prices in  there was little additional investment or maintenance activity by our gas customers  many of which have experienced liquidity constraints as a result of financial difficulties related to their former energy trading activities 
recently  amid increasing demand for crude and its derivatives and the tight market conditions  oil refineries have been scheduling maintenance activities and upgrading equipment to meet environmental regulations 
in addition  chemical companies had been able to invest and maintain their equipment as they pass through the price increases to the end user 
this recent evidence suggests a potential change in how the customer response to market conditions may impact our business activities 
the diminished demand for our products and services could lead to excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices in our industry  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  including profit margins  financial condition and cash flows 
as we expand our customer alliance programs  an increasing portion of our revenues will be on a fixed fee basis  subjecting us to the risks associated with cost overruns 
as part of our customer alliance programs  we enter into maintenance agreements that are fixed fee arrangements 
under these agreements  we provide maintenance services  including replacement parts and repair services  at a specified fixed fee and  accordingly  bear the risk of cost overruns 
while we conduct a detailed analysis of the customers equipment prior to entering into fixed fee maintenance agreements and benefit from our extensive experience in the flow control industry  our failure to estimate accurately the anticipated equipment failures and maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  including profit margins  financial condition and cash flows 
we sell our products in highly competitive markets  which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 
the markets for our products are fragmented and highly competitive 
we compete against large and well established national and global companies  as well as regional and local companies  low cost replicators of spare parts and in house maintenance departments of our end user customers 
we compete based on price  technical expertise  timeliness of delivery  previous installation history and reputation for quality and reliability  with price competition tending to be more significant for sales to original equipment manufacturers 
some of our customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventory 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
no assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive regulation under environmental laws 
these laws can impose substantial sanctions for violations or operational changes that may limit production 
we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all countries in which we operate 
we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in most of our manufacturing and foundry operations 
many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes  and some may require clean up of historical contamination 
we are currently conducting investigation and or remediation activities at a number of locations where we have known environmental concerns 
in addition  we have been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties at four superfund sites 

table of contents we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing requirements  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are party to asbestos containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are a defendant in a large number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products formerly manufactured and or distributed by us 
all such products were used as self contained components of process equipment  and we do not believe that there was any emission of ambient asbestos containing fiber during the use of this equipment 
although we are defending these allegations vigorously and believe that a high percentage of these lawsuits are covered by insurance or indemnities from other companies  there can be no assurance that we will prevail or that payments made by insurance or such other companies would be adequate  and unfavorable rulings  judgments and or settlement terms could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  approximately half of whom were located in the united states 
of our us employees  approximately are represented by unions 
we also have unionized employees in argentina  australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  finland  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and we have not experienced any recent strikes or work stoppages  no assurances can be made that we will not in the future experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions  works councils  other groups representing employees  or our employees generally  or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor 
inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our competitive position 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee  however  that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
for example  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries in which we operate 
in addition  while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements could be breached  and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know how related to the design  manufacture or operation of our products 
if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  any proceedings could be burdensome and costly  and we may not prevail 
furthermore  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our sales  results of operations and cash flows 
our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain senior executives and other key personnel 
during and  we appointed a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  corporate treasurer  controller and chief accounting officer  chief compliance officer  chief information officer  vice president of tax and a vice president of human resources  and we created and staffed new positions responsible for accounting policy and procedures  financial reporting  tax compliance and internal audit 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our newly appointed and existing senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
to promote continuity of senior management  in march our board of directors approved a transitional executive security 
table of contents plan  which provides financial incentives to key management personnel to remain employed by us for the near term 
no assurances can be made  however  that we will be successful in our efforts to retain key members of our senior management 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices  our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we purchase substantially all electric power and other raw materials we use in the manufacturing of our products from outside sources 
the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control 
in recent years  the prices for energy  metal alloys  nickel and certain other of our raw materials have increased  with the prices for energy currently exceeding historical averages 
we also strive to offset our increased costs through continuous improvement program cip  where gains are achieved in operational efficiencies 
if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials to our customers  our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely affected 
significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans  the funded status of these plans and our pension expense 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are required to be funded in the united states  the united kingdom  canada  japan  mexico and the netherlands  and defined benefit plans that are not required to be funded in germany  france  austria and sweden 
our pension liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and  in the case of the plans that are required to be funded  the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a change in the discount rate can result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations  affecting the reported status of our pension plans and our pension expense 
significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets 
changes in the expected return on plan assets assumption can result in significant changes in our pension expense 
we currently expect to make substantial contributions to our us and foreign defined benefit pension plans during the next three years  and may make additional substantial contributions thereafter 
an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act may not be available for certain acquisitions of interest in our common stock fund in the flowserve corporation retirement savings plan k plan which exposes us to potential liabilities  including rescission rights 
as of may   due to the non current status of our financial filings with the sec  our registration statements on form s were no longer available to cover offers and sales of securities to our employees and other persons 
since that date  the acquisition of interests in our common stock fund under our k plan by plan participants may have been subject to the registration requirements of the securities act of or applicable state securities laws and may not have qualified for an available exemption from such requirements 
federal securities laws generally provide for a one year rescission right for an investor who acquires unregistered securities in a transaction that is subject to registration and for which no exemption was available 
as such  an investor successfully asserting a rescission right during the one year time period has the right to require an issuer to repurchase the securities acquired by the investor at the price paid by the investor for the securities or if such security has been disposed of  to receive damages with respect to any loss on such disposition  plus interest from the date of acquisition 
these rights may apply to affected participants in our k plan 
based on our current stock price  we believe that our current potential liability for rescission claims is not material to our financial condition or results of operations  however  our potential liability could become material in the future if our stock price were to fall below participants acquisition prices for their interest in our stock fund during the one year period following the unregistered acquisitions 

table of contents a significant number of stock option exercises following the removal of the current suspension on stock option exercises would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share we have a substantial number of outstanding stock options granted in past years to employees under our stock option plans which have not been exercisable for an extended period due to our non current filing status relating to our sec financial reports 
given the significant increase in our share price during the period in which optionees have been unable to exercise their options  it is possible that many holders may want to exercise soon after they are first able to do so 
if  following our removal of the current suspension on stock option exercises  the holders of a large number of these options promptly exercise  there would be some dilutive impact on our earnings per share 
the impact on our earnings per share is dependent upon share price  number of shares and strike price of shares exercised 
we may incur material costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of one of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected 
while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims  we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future  if at all  and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims 
in addition  product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time  regardless of the ultimate outcome 
an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have an adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition and cash flows 
even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products  claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company 
warranty claims are not covered by insurance  and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed 
our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit our operating and financial flexibility 
we are required to make mandatory payments and  under certain circumstances  mandatory prepayments on our outstanding indebtedness which may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes and could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the industry 
in addition  the agreements governing our bank credit facilities and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and somewhat limit management s discretion in operating our businesses 
these agreements limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures  change fiscal year  pay dividends and make other distributions  prepay subordinated debt  make investments and other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the credit facilities contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders leverage and interest coverage financial covenants and our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements 
our ability to 
table of contents comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to continue to expand our market presence through acquisitions  and any future acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs 
since  we have expanded through a number of acquisitions  and we may pursue acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to ours in the future 
our ability to implement this growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates  covenants in our credit agreement and other debt agreements and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
in addition  acquisition of businesses may require additional debt financing  resulting in higher leverage and an increase in interest expense  and could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities 
should we acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may encounter operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the challenges associated with acquisitions include loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company  conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls  including accounting systems and controls  with our operations  coordinating operations that are increased in scope  geographic diversity and complexity  retooling and reprogramming of equipment  hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day operations 
furthermore  no guarantees can be made that we will realize the cost savings  synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition  or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect 
if we are not able to address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses  or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be adversely affected

item legal proceedings 
we are a defendant in a large number of pending lawsuits which include  in many cases  multiple claimants that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos containing products manufactured and or distributed by us in the past 
any such products were encapsulated and used only as components of process equipment  and we do not believe that any emission of respirable asbestos fibers occurred during the use of this equipment 
we believe that a high percentage of the applicable claims are covered by applicable insurance or indemnities from other companies 
on february   we received an informal inquiry from the sec requesting the voluntary production of documents and information related to our february  announcement that we would restate our financial results for the nine months ended september  and the full years  and on june   we were advised that the sec had issued a formal order of private investigation into issues regarding this restatement 
table of contents and any other issues that arise from the investigation 
on may   we were informed by the staff of the sec that it had concluded this investigation without recommending any enforcement action against us 
during the quarter ended september   related lawsuits were filed in federal court in the northern district of texas the court  alleging that we violated federal securities laws 
since the filing of these cases  which have been consolidated  the lead plaintiff has amended its complaint several times 
the lead plaintiff s current pleading is the fifth consolidated amended complaint the complaint 
the complaint alleges that federal securities violations occurred between february  and september  and names as defendants the company  c 
scott greer  our former chairman  president and chief executive officer  renee j

greer and ms 
hornbaker of unspecified incentive based or equity based compensation and profits from any stock sales  and recovery of costs 
on november   the court entered an order denying the defendants motions to dismiss the complaint

we strongly believe that the suit was improperly filed and have filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case 
on february   we received a subpoena from the sec regarding goods and services that certain foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through during the united nations oil for food program 
this investigation includes a review of whether any inappropriate payments were made to iraqi officials in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act 
the investigation includes periods prior  to as well as subsequent to our acquisition of the foreign operations involved in the investigation 
we may be subject to liabilities if violations are found regardless of whether they relate to periods before or subsequent to our acquisition 
in addition  one of our foreign subsidiary s operations is cooperating with a foreign governmental investigation of that site s involvement in the united nations oil for food program 
this cooperation has included responding to an investigative trip by foreign authorities to the foreign subsidiary s site  providing relevant documentation to these authorities and answering their questions 
we are unable to predict how or if the foreign authorities will pursue this matter in the future 

table of contents we believe that both the sec and this foreign authority are investigating other companies from their actions arising from the oil for food program 
we are in the process of reviewing and responding to the sec subpoena and assessing the implications of the foreign investigation  including the continuation of a thorough internal investigation 
our investigation is in the early stages and has included and will include a detailed review of contracts with the iraqi government during the period in question and certain payments associated therewith 
additionally  we have and will continue to conduct interviews with employees with knowledge of the contracts and payments in question 
we are in the early phases of our internal investigation and as a result are unable to make any definitive determination whether any inappropriate payments were made and accordingly are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
we will continue to fully cooperate in both the sec and the foreign investigations 
both investigations are in progress but  at this point  are incomplete 
accordingly  if the sec and or the foreign authorities take enforcement action with regard to these investigations  we may be required to pay fines  consent to injunctions against future conduct or suffer other penalties which could potentially materially impact our business financial statements and cash flows 
in march  we initiated a process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control laws and regulations 
upon initial investigation  it appears that some product transactions and technology transfers may not technically been in compliance with us export control laws and regulations and require further review 
with assistance from outside counsel  we are currently involved in a systematic process to conduct further review which we believe will take about months to complete given the complexity of the export laws and the scope of the investigation 
any potential violations of us export control laws and regulations that are identified may result in civil or criminal penalties  including fines and or other penalties 
because our review into this issue is ongoing  we are currently unable to determine the full extent of potential violations or the nature or amount of potential penalties to which we might be subject to in the future 
given that the resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time  we are not able to reasonably estimate the maximum amount of liability that could result from final resolution of this matter 
we cannot currently predict whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to do business outside the united states  or on our financial condition 
we have been involved as a potentially responsible party prp at former public waste disposal sites that may be subject to remediation under pending government procedures 
the sites are in various stages of evaluation by federal and state environmental authorities 
the projected cost of remediation at these sites  as well as our alleged fair share allocation  is uncertain and speculative until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved 
at each site  there are many other parties who have similarly been identified  and the identification and location of additional parties is continuing under applicable federal or state law 
many of the other parties identified are financially strong and solvent companies that appear able to pay their share of the remediation costs 
based on our information about the waste disposal practices at these sites and the environmental regulatory process in general  we believe that it is likely that ultimate remediation liability costs for each site will be apportioned among all liable parties  including site owners and waste transporters  according to the volumes and or toxicity of the wastes shown to have been disposed of at the sites 
we believe that our exposure for existing disposal sites will be less than  we are also a defendant in several other lawsuits  including product liability claims  that are insured  subject to the applicable deductibles  arising in the ordinary course of business 
based on currently available information  we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated probable losses for such lawsuits 
we are also involved in a substantial number of labor claims  including one case where we had a confidential settlement reflected in our results 
although none of the aforementioned potential liabilities can be quantified with absolute certainty except as otherwise indicated above  we have established reserves covering exposures relating to probable contingencies  to the extent believed to be reasonably estimable and probable  which we believe to be reasonable based on past experience and available facts 
while additional exposures beyond these reserves could exist  they currently cannot be estimated 
we will continue to evaluate these potential contingent loss exposures and  if they develop  recognize expense as soon as such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents we are also involved in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  none of which we believe to be material to our business  operations or overall financial condition 
however  resolutions or dispositions of claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise could have a significant impact on our operating results for the reporting period in which any such resolution or disposition occurs 
as a consequence of all legal matters  including settlements of both publicly disclosed litigation and otherwise  we recognized expenses of approximately million in  million in and million in item submission of matters to a vote of security holders

unregistered sales of equity securities as of may   due to the non current status of our financial filings with the sec  our registration statements on form s were no longer available to cover offers and sales of securities to our employees and other persons 
since that date  the acquisition of interests in our common stock fund under our k plan by plan participants may have been subject to the registration requirements of the securities act of or applicable state securities laws and may not have qualified for an available exemption from such requirements 
federal securities laws generally provide for a one year rescission right for an investor who acquires unregistered securities in a transaction that is subject to registration and for which no exemption was available 
as such  an investor successfully asserting a rescission right during the one year time period has the right to require an issuer to repurchase the securities acquired by the investor at the price paid by the investor for the securities or if such security has been disposed of  to receive damages with respect to any loss on such disposition  plus interest from the date of acquisition 
these rights may apply to affected participants in our k plan and their affected interest in this plan may involve up to  shares of our common stock acquired pursuant to the k plan during and an indeterminate number of shares acquired during based on our current stock price  we believe that our current potential liability for rescission claims is not material to our financial condition or results of operations  
table of contents however  our potential liability could become material in the future if our stock price were to fall below participants acquisition prices for their interest in our stock fund during the one year period following the unregistered acquisitions 
during  we issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock to employees pursuant to the stock compensation plan and  shares of restricted stock pursuant to the flowserve corporation restricted stock plan

executive overview we are an established leader in the fluid motion and control business  with a strong portfolio of pumping systems  valves  sealing solutions  automation and services in support of the power  oil and gas  chemical  and other process markets 
these products are mission critical in the movement  control and protection of fluids in our customers critical processes  whether it is a refinery  a power generation facility or a transportation pipeline 
our business model is heavily influenced by the capital spending of these industries for the placement of new products in service 
the worldwide installed base of our products is another important source of revenue where our products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of the many key industrial processes 
the aftermarket business is generally a higher margin business and a key component to our profitable growth 
we have experienced steadily improving conditions in and in several core markets  including oil and gas  chemical  and numerous general industries 
the rise and continued elevation of the price of crude oil and natural gas in particular has spurred capital investment in the oil and gas market  resulting in many new projects and expansion opportunities 
although feedstock costs are increasing in the chemical market  greater global demand is allowing companies to pass through pricing and strengthen the global market 
the opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket business in future years is a critical by product of these market conditions 
we have six key strategies that have been well communicated throughout the business 
one of our key strategies is the globalization of our business 
see our strategies section of this management s discussion and analysis for a discussion of our six key strategies 
we currently have approximately  employees in more than countries 
we continue to implement new quick response centers qrcs to be better positioned as near to our customers as possible for service and support  as a means to capture this important aftermarket business 
our markets have improved and we see corresponding growth in our business  much of which is in non traditional areas of the world where new oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
we and our customers are seeing rapid growth in asia  with china providing a source of significant project growth 
we have a strategy in place to increase our presence in china to capture the aftermarket business with our current installed base as well as new projects and process plant expansions 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it becomes more imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
our global supply chain capability is being expanded to meet the global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
significant efforts are underway to reduce the supply base and drive processes across the divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction 
in addition  we are improving our supply chain management capability to insure we meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while reducing warranty costs across our global operations through a focused continuous improvement process cip 
table of contents initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative is to maximize service fulfillment to our customers such as on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
this program is a key factor in our margin expansion plans 
recent developments sec matters on february   we received an informal inquiry from the sec requesting the voluntary production of documents and information related to our february  announcement that we would restate our financial results for the nine months ended september  and the full years  and on june   we were advised that the sec had issued a formal order of private investigation into issues regarding this restatement and any other issues that arise from the investigation 
on may   we were informed by the staff of the sec that it had concluded this investigation without recommending any enforcement action against us 
on february   we received a subpoena from the sec regarding goods and services that certain foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through during the united nations oil for food program 
this investigation includes a review of whether any inappropriate payments were made to iraqi officials in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act 
the investigation includes periods prior to  as well as subsequent to our acquisition of the foreign operations involved in the investigation 
we may be subject to liabilities if violations are found regardless of whether they relate to periods before or subsequent to our acquisition 
in addition  one of our foreign subsidiary s operations is cooperating with a foreign governmental investigation of that site s involvement in the united nations oil for food program 
this cooperation has included responding to an investigative trip by foreign authorities to the foreign subsidiary s site  providing relevant documentation to these authorities and answering their questions 
we are unable to predict how or if the foreign authorities will pursue this matter in the future 
we believe that both the sec and this foreign authority are investigating other companies from their actions arising from the united nations oil for food program 
we are in the process of reviewing and responding to the sec subpoena and assessing the implications of the foreign investigation  including the continuation of a thorough internal investigation 
our investigation is in the early stages and has included and will include a detailed review of contracts with the iraqi government during the period in question and certain payments associated therewith 
additionally  we have and will continue to conduct interviews with employees with knowledge of the contracts and payments in question 
we are in the early phases of our internal investigation and as a result are unable to make any definitive determination whether any inappropriate payments were made and accordingly are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
we will continue to fully cooperate in both the sec and the foreign investigations 
both investigations are in progress but  at this point  are incomplete 
accordingly  if the sec and or the foreign authorities take enforcement action with regard to these investigations  we may be required to pay fines  consent to injunctions against future conduct or suffer other penalties which could potentially materially impact our business  financial statements and cash flows 
legal matters on march   a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed purportedly on our behalf in federal court in the northern district of texas 
the lawsuit names as defendants c

we are named as a nominal defendant 
based primarily on certain of the purported misstatements alleged in the federal securities case filed on september  and described in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report  the plaintiff asserts claims against the defendants for breaches of fiduciary duty 
the plaintiff alleges that the purported breaches of fiduciary duty occurred between and the plaintiff seeks on behalf of us an unspecified amount of damages  disgorgement by mr 
greer and 
table of contents ms 
hornbaker of salaries  bonuses  restricted stock and stock options  and recovery of attorneys fees and costs 
we strongly believe that the suit was improperly filed and intend to file a motion seeking dismissal of the case 
for additional information regarding other pending securities class action and derivative lawsuits  see item legal proceedings 
in march  we initiated a process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control laws and regulations 
upon initial investigation  it appears that some product transactions and technology transfers may technically not be in compliance with us export control laws and regulations and require further review 
with assistance from outside counsel  we are currently involved in a systematic process to conduct further review  which we believe will take approximately months to complete given the complexity of the export laws and the scope of our investigation 
any potential violations of us export control laws and regulations that are identified may result in civil or criminal penalties  including fines and or other penalties 
because our review into this issue is ongoing  we are currently unable to determine the full extent of potential violations or the nature or amount of potential penalties to which we might be subject to in the future 
given that the resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time  we are not able to reasonably estimate the maximum amount of liability that could result from final resolution of this matter 
we cannot currently predict whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse affect on our business  including our ability to do business outside the us  or on our financial condition 
irs audits we have recently concluded an internal revenue service irs audit of our us federal income tax returns for the years through based on its audit work  the irs has issued proposed adjustments to increase taxable income during through by million  and to deny foreign tax credits of million in the aggregate 
the tax liability resulting from these proposed adjustments will be offset with foreign tax credit carryovers and other refund claims  and therefore should not result in a material future cash payment  pending final review by the joint committee on taxation 
we anticipate this review will be completed by december  the effect of the adjustments to current and deferred taxes has been reflected in previously filed consolidated financial statements for the applicable periods 
during  the irs will commence an audit of our us federal income tax returns for the years through while we expect that the upcoming irs audit will be similar in scope to the recently completed examination  the upcoming audit may be broader 
furthermore  the preliminary results from the audit of through are not indicative of the future result of the audit of through the audit of through may result in additional tax payments by us  the amount of which may be material  but will not be known until the irs audit is finalized 
in the course of the irs audit of through  we identified record keeping and other material internal control weaknesses  which caused us to incur significant expense to substantiate our tax return items and address information and document requests made by the irs 
we expect to incur similar expense with respect to the upcoming irs audit of the years through the irs has issued a notice of inadequate records for the years through  and may issue a similar notice for the years through while the irs has agreed not to assess penalties for inadequacy of records with respect to the years through  no assurances can be made that the irs will not seek to assess such penalties or other types of penalties with respect to the years through such penalties could result in a material impact to the consolidated results of operations 
additionally  the record keeping issues noted above may result in future us state and local tax assessments of tax  penalties and interest  which could have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations 
management changes and other employee matters during the past two years  following resignations of several of our senior executives  we hired lewis m 
kling as our chief operating officer and subsequently appointed him as our president and chief executive officer  hired mark a

to promote continuity of senior management  in march our board of directors approved a transitional executive security plan  which provides cash and stock based incentives to key management personnel to remain employed by us for the near term 
as a result of this plan  we recorded additional compensation expenses in of million and an expense of approximately million will be recorded in see transitional executive security plan in item executive compensation of this annual report for a detailed discussion on this plan 
divestitures in an effort to better align our business portfolio with our core strategic objectives  in the first quarter of  we made a definitive decision to divest the general services group gsg  non core service operations which provide online repair and other third party services  and we engaged an investment banking firm to commence marketing 
as a result  we reclassified the group to discontinued operations in the first quarter of sales for gsg were million and million in and  respectively 
total assets at march   ascribed to gsg  inclusive of approximately million of allocated goodwill  were approximately million 
we performed an impairment analysis of gsg at march  on a held for sale basis and  after the allocation of goodwill  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million during the first quarter of the initial estimated fair value at march  was based upon investment banker s valuation of gsg s estimated fair value as well as initial bids received from potential purchasers 
as the year progressed  the number of potential buyers diminished to one potential purchaser and the business underperformed due to the pending sale 
as a result  the lone bidder reduced its initial offer and accordingly  we recognized additional impairment charges aggregating approximately million throughout  for total impairment charges in of approximately million 
gsg was sold on december  for approximately million in gross cash proceeds  subject to final working capital adjustments that remain under negotiation  while retaining approximately million of net accounts receivable 
we used approximately million of the net cash proceeds to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
business overview our company we believe that we are a world leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems 
we develop and manufacture precision engineered flow control equipment  such as pumps  valves and seals  for critical service applications that require high reliability 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
we conduct our operations through three business segments flowserve pump division fpd  for engineered pumps  industrial pumps and related services  flow control division fcd  for industrial valves  manual valves  control valves  nuclear valves  valve actuators and controls and related services  and flow solutions division fsd  for precision mechanical seals and related services 
our product portfolio is built on over well respected brand names  such as durco  idp  valtek and durametallic  which we believe is the most comprehensive in the industry 
we sell our products and services to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and end users 
our markets our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water treatment and several other industries that we collectively refer to as general industries 

table of contents demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures by our customers depends  in turn  on the general economic conditions and conditions in their industries  which affect their profitability 
the level of capital expenditures by our customers also depends on their liquidity  whether through cash flows from operations or access to financing 
the oil and gas industry represented approximately and of our sales in and  respectively 
high petroleum prices generally spur additional investment in upstream petroleum projects  and high prices in and contributed to an increase in bookings for projects  particularly in asia  africa  the middle east and south america 
in contrast to their effect on the upstream petroleum projects  high crude oil prices often reduce the demand for our products and services from crude oil refineries and natural gas processors as they seek to take advantage of favorable refining margins by operating at high levels of capacity utilization and deferring maintenance 
clean fuel regulations  particularly in the us  led to some project business from crude oil refiners 
the profitability of such projects  however  is typically lower than for maintenance related products and services as these are generally large projects obtained through a competitive bidding process 
while high oil and gas prices are generally good for our oil and gas customers  they are generally adverse for chemical companies  since crude oil and natural gas are critical inputs in the manufacturing of their products 
in  the price of natural gas in the us increased almost as compared with  and increased in as compared with this significantly affected our chemical customers  who faced high feed stock costs 
however  greater global demand is allowing companies to pass through pricing and strengthen the global market 
the demand for chemical based products appears to be increasing  so we expect to see some improvement in the demand for our products in the chemical industry 
further  this industry s improved profitability could spur new investment in other parts of the world such as asia  and we would expect to benefit from those investments as well 
in and  the chemical industry represented approximately and  respectively  of our sales 
increased natural gas prices also diminished the profitability of many power generators that in recent years made significant investments in power plants that generate electricity from natural gas 
while they have been able to recover a portion of their higher costs through rate increases  their liquidity is still challenged due to overinvestment in these power facilities in recent years 
however  a number of nuclear power generators are planning significant maintenance activities 
we have seen an increase in our orders for this area and it has been a positive contributor to orders  sales and earnings 
in addition  there are several coal fired power plants planned for the us  and we are actively pursuing the flow control opportunities for these projects 
the revenue opportunity for our products at a coal fired plant typically can be three times that of a natural gas power plant 
the power industry represented approximately and of our sales in and  respectively 
worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create demand for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  especially pumps 
we believe that we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean area and the middle east 
this is a significant market for our pump and valve actuation products 
in and  the water market represented approximately and  respectively  of our sales 
general industries represents a variety of different businesses  including mining  pulp and paper  food and beverage  steel and heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  none of which individually represents more than of total sales in and general industries represented approximately and of our sales in and  respectively 
we started to see some improvement in these businesses in  most notably mining and steel  after they experienced what appeared to be troughs in other industries  such as food and beverage and hvac  were relatively stable 
our customers include engineering contractors  oems  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and oems are typically for large project orders  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders generally have lead times in excess of three months 
project orders provide product to our customers either directly or indirectly for their new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 

table of contents the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as the book and ship business  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
they are typically for more standard products  parts or services 
each of our three segments generates this type of business 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
timelines of delivery  quality and the proximity of service centers are important considerations for our aftermarket products and services 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide a quick response  customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  aftermarket for standard products is very competitive and price competition has generally been increasing 
price competition tends to be more significant for oems than aftermarket services and generally has been increasing 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from our large installed base of pumps  seals and valves  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
our reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type are based upon analytical review of individual operational results and our knowledge of their respective businesses  as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories 
these trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system 
our strategies our overarching objective is to grow our position as an integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry 
this objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and marketing the power of our portfolio of products 
it also includes delivering specific end user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership 
sustainable  profitable growth is being driven using six strategies that are communicated throughout our company 
these strategies include organic growth  globalization  process excellence  portfolio management  organizational capability and technology innovation 
the key elements of our strategies are outlined below 
organic growth organic growth is a key long term initiative to grow our top line revenues 
this goal is to develop and launch new products and solutions as well as customer partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product s total life cycle 
we are one of the few pump  valve and seal companies who can offer our customers a differentiated option of not only products and services  but can also offer an additional option that includes any combination of products and solution support packages across our portfolio 
our combined pump and seal end user teams have been particularly successful in delivering new solution programs and increasing organic aftermarket growth 
we seek to capture additional market share by creating win win opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs pursuant to which we provide all or an agreed portion of a customers parts and servicing needs 
our customer alliances enable us to develop long term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales 
we additionally seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump  seal and valve base as a means to expand our aftermarket services business  as customers increasingly use third party aftermarket service providers like us to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability 
the aftermarket services business provides us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales and allows us to be in frequent contact with our customers  building our knowledge of customer needs and providing cross selling opportunities 
we are building on our established presence through an extensive qrc global network to provide the immediate parts  service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business from our installed base 
new product and service development is driven through our product management organization working in concert with engineering  operations and sales 
our goal is to increase our revenues from new products and services developed over the last five years 
our new product development process has made significant progress in 
table of contents demonstrating a pipeline of new and modified products and services 
we expect our research and development costs to increase beginning in to support our goal of increased revenues from new products and services 
globalization the globalization initiative of our business has several facets that include expanding our global presence to capture business outside our traditional geographic market areas china  russia  south america  middle east and africa  utilizing low cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy  and attract and retain the global intellectual capital required to support our global growth plans in the new geographical areas 
we believe there are attractive oem opportunities in international markets  particularly in south america  the middle east and asia pacific  and we intend to continue to utilize our global presence to further penetrate these markets 
our recent successes in these markets include contracts worth more than million for the supply of pumps and related equipment to the nanhai petrochemicals project in china  and contracts worth more than million for the shenhua coal liquefaction project in china 
in our aftermarket services business  we seek to strategically add sites as our customers and our customer base grow in order to provide our customers with rapid response  fast delivery and onsite field repair 
we are focused on shifting  as appropriate  certain of our manufacturing and engineering functions to  and increasing our supply of materials and components from  lower cost areas such as india  china  mexico  south america and eastern europe 
in  these areas accounted for approximately of our direct material spending  compared to approximately in we are also focused on utilizing supply chain management to reduce our procurement costs  including by expanding purchases through reverse auctions  further consolidating our procurement of goods at a better value 
in addition  we have expanded our china presence with additional sales and supply chain professionals  new management and growth plans that include acquisition or development of new capabilities that will enhance the penetration of products in china for oil and gas and power projects as well as provide a base for the export of products 
process excellence the process excellence initiative encapsulates ongoing programs that drive increased customer fulfillment at the lowest cost 
this initiative includes driving improved customer fulfillment across our company through metrics such as on time delivery  cost reduction  quality  cycle time reduction and warranty reduction  and continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies  implements consistent processes across our company and ensures our future success as an integrated company 
we seek to increase our operational efficiency through our cip initiative 
it utilizes tools such as six sigma methodology  lean manufacturing  and constraint management to improve quality and processes  reduce product cycle times and lower costs 
recognizing that our employees are our most valuable resource in achieving our operational excellence goals  we have instituted broad cip training  and to date over of our employees are cip trained or certified as green belts or black belts  deployed on cip projects throughout our company 
as a result of our cip initiatives  we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time  improve on time delivery and service response time  lower inventory levels and otherwise reduce costs 
we have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one of our businesses and deployed to another flowserve business  and we continue to look for opportunities to apply the cip tools for improved performance 

table of contents we seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of our accounts receivable and inventory 
see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis 
portfolio management the continued management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our company s success 
we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions and rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with our customers and shareholders 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities as we seek to broaden our product portfolio and operational capabilities and to expedite our expansion into faster growing asian  african and south american markets 
in that regard  our additional investment in thompsons  kelly lewis pty 
ltd 
tkl in march strengthened our product offering in the mining industry and broadened our manufacturing capabilities in the asia pacific region  which includes china  japan  singapore  korea  india  australia  new zealand and thailand 
see further discussion of the tkl acquisition in our results of operations section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
we are seeking to divest operations that we consider non core to our overall business  such as operations that do not serve our core customer base or provide limited synergies with our other businesses 
for example  in november we sold our government marine business unit gmbu  and in december we sold gsg 
see further discussion of these discontinued operations in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
organizational capability we believe there are several elements to building an enhanced organizational capability the development of a deeper talent pool through training and cross divisional and functional assignments allows us the flexibility as we grow and expand the organization to fill positions internally 
we believe career learning and development is critical to the building of an improved global organizational capability for the future 
the need to capture the intellectual capital in our workforce and that of our customers and share it within our company is considered a competitive advantage  and building an organization with improved compliance to mandatory and recommended processes and procedures and implementing the information systems that ensure compliance will be the backbone of our culture as we move forward 
a multi year agreement was completed in to distribute electronic learning packages in multiple languages for the flowserve code of business conduct and other compliance programs globally throughout our company 
this will be expanded to include export compliance  and regulatory compliance us and foreign  as well as other programs around harassment and employee behaviors 
the emphasis on ethics and compliance was significantly strengthened in as a core organizational capability with a new chief compliance officer 
in  we installed a learning management system lms that allowed the development and tracking of the delivery of electronic learning systems 
this system allows us to track our employees compliance and policy understanding through electronic means 
lms also permits the on line enrollment for customer training as a means to share and improve their intellectual capital 
technology innovation the infusion of new product technologies has become a core requirement as we look to improve the development of new products and services 
our internal goal is to improve the percentage of new products as a function of revenue over the next five years 
the investment in technology will continue to increase in a 
table of contents cross divisional technology team is in place to ensure that the technologies developed are available for wide use across all divisions to maximize the return on investments 
the development of an intelligent pumping system showcases the technologies available to maximize uptime and proactively identify anomalies before they become major issues 
we were the sponsor for a national energy summit in that brought together major companies in the pursuit of energy management initiatives 
the technologies available to decrease the energy usage for our customers are being infused into new services for customers 
our results of operations as a result of selling gsg  which was included in fcd  in december  and gmbu  an fpd business  in november  we treated these dispositions as discontinued operations and reclassified the financial information reported for all periods presented 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million in  compared to a loss of million in the increase is due primarily to the impairment of gsg  which is more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
sales amounts in millions sales sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the increase in sales is attributable to all three of our segments 
these increases are due primarily to continued growth in the oil and gas industry  which has positively impacted our flowserve pump and flow solutions divisions  and the continued recovery and strengthening of major valve markets 
sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with currency benefits were the result of the strengthening of international currencies  particularly the euro  against the us dollar 
the increase in sales includes new sales of million resulting from our acquisition of tkl in march  increased activities of our core markets served  including oil and gas  power and chemicals  and strong growth in the asia pacific region 
sales to international customers  including export sales from the us  were approximately of sales in compared with of sales in and of sales in sales into the asia pacific region were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
sales into europe  middle east and africa ema were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
excluding currency translation impacts  we believe that our sales to international customers will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales  as we believe our highest revenue growth opportunities are in asia  south america and africa 
bookings and backlog amounts in millions bookings backlog at period end we define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacture  service or support 
amounts presented above include bookings related to discontinued operations of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
bookings in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million and discontinued operations  as compared with bookings for tkl  which was acquired in march  increased million in as compared with increased bookings are also attributable to improved bookings in ema for our flowserve pump division and improved bookings in asia pacific for our flowserve pump and flow control divisions 
establishment of customer alliances has resulted in increased bookings in our flow 
table of contents solutions division as described below 
bookings have also been positively impacted by continued strength in the oil and gas industry and recovery of major valve markets 
bookings in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million and discontinued operations  as compared with bookings for tkl  which was acquired in march  were million in increased bookings were due to increases in the oil and gas industry  one of our primary served markets  which was spurred by increased crude oil prices 
backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders 
amounts presented above include backlog related to discontinued operations of  million and million for  and  respectively 
backlog at december  increased by million  or  excluding negative currency effects of approximately million and discontinued operations  as compared with  primarily attributable to the strong bookings performance in  as well as an increase in large oil and gas project orders in ema for our flowserve pump division 
by the end of  we expect to ship over of this backlog 
backlog at december  decreased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the decrease is due to improved customer delivery time 
gross profit and gross profit margin amounts in millions gross profit gross profit margin gross profit margin of in increased as compared with gross profit margin in was positively impacted by operational improvements attributable to our cip initiative  which resulted in cost savings  a higher mix of aftermarket business  which generally has a higher margin  and increased sales  which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs 
additionally  the charge to cost of sales to increase the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was significantly lower in than the charge recorded in  which had a favorable impact on gross profit margin 
gross profit margin of in decreased slightly as compared with gross profit margin in was positively impacted by operational improvements attributable to our cip initiative  which resulted in cost savings  synergies and a higher mix of aftermarket business  which generally has a higher margin 
these were offset by a significant charge to cost of sales for the increase in the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory in our flow control division  as discussed below  and a million increase in incentive compensation as compared to selling  general and administrative expense sg a amounts in millions sg a expense sg a expense as a percentage of sales in each of the three years presented  at least of sg a consisted of employee related costs  which includes payroll  benefits and incentive payments  and at least of sg a consisted of professional fees  which includes audit  legal  contractor and consulting fees 
sg a in increased by million  or  excluding currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase in sg a is due primarily to the following employee related costs of million including sales commissions  incentive compensation and equity incentive programs arising from improved performance and the higher stock price million  severance and transition expenses million  and modification of stock options expiration terms for former executives  current and retired employees and board of directors million 
see further discussion of stock modifications in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
the increase in sg a is also attributable to increases in professional fees resulting from the restatement of  and the first quarter of  which includes a million increase in audit fees and a million increase in other professional fees related to tax consulting  accounting and internal audit assistance 
these increases in 
table of contents professional fees were partially offset by a million decrease in legal fees and expenses and a million decrease in costs incurred related to section compliance 
sg a in increased by million  or  excluding currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase is due to a million increase in annual incentive compensation and a million increase in professional and consulting fees related primarily to the restatement of our consolidated financial results for and prior years  and financial statement audits and compliance with section integration and restructuring expense amounts in millions integration expense restructuring expense the integration and restructuring expenses relate to the integration of invensys flow control division ifc into our flow control division 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ifc in  we initiated a restructuring program designed to reduce costs and eliminate excess capacity by closing some existing facilities  and reducing sales and related support personnel 
we did not incur integration or restructuring expenses in or as we had largely completed our restructuring and integration programs related to ifc during  except for final severance payments and payments for other exit activities primarily related to european integration activities 
approximately million and million of integration and restructuring expenses  respectively  for the year ended december  are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and are related to gsg facilities affected by the restructuring program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report for further discussion on integration and restructuring expenses 
operating income amounts in millions operating income operating income as a percentage of sales operating income in increased by million  or as compared with  primarily as a result of the increases in gross profit margin  partially offset by the increases in sg a discussed above 
currency had a nominal effect in operating income in decreased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with as discussed above  sg a costs increased in as a result of increased incentive compensation and increased professional and consulting fees 
the increase in sg a costs is partially offset by the reduction in integration and restructuring costs 
interest expense and loss on repayment of debt amounts in millions interest expense interest income loss on debt repayment and extinguishment interest expense decreased million in as compared with primarily as a result of the refinancing of our senior subordinated notes with the proceeds of borrowings under our new credit facilities 
see further discussion of our refinancing in the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

we have operations in european and asian countries that provide various tax incentives 
in  we were granted an indefinite preferential tax rate of approximately in switzerland for certain sales and marketing activities 
during  we received a year  tax rate in singapore for income in excess of a prescribed base amount generated from certain regional headquarter activities  subject to certain employment and investment requirements 
in india  we were granted tax exemptions for profits derived from export sales and certain 
table of contents manufacturing operations in prescribed areas for a period of years 
the indian tax exemptions expire in and  respectively 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law  creating a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate of  versus the us federal statutory rate of 
during  we repatriated approximately million as part of the million discussed above pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan as described by the act 
we have not recognized the lower tax rate on these dividends in our financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of the act 
to the extent this uncertainty is favorably resolved in a future reporting period  the benefit associated with these dividends will be recognized in that period 
the act also provides for a phase out of the existing eti exclusion for foreign export sales  as it was viewed to be inconsistent with the international trade protocols set by the european union 
this phase out provides that the benefit for our otherwise qualifying export sales in and will be limited to approximately and  respectively 
as a replacement for the loss of the eti export incentive  the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through this manufacturing deduction had no impact to our tax rate  and the impact to our future tax rate has not yet been quantified

on may   the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of was signed into law  creating an exclusion from us taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends  interest  rents  and royalties which  prior to  have been subject to us taxation 
this exclusion applies for the years through  and may apply to certain of our related party payments 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be similar to or lower than due to lower levels of us income inclusions from our low taxed foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings  estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location and the estimated impact of tax planning strategies 
changes in any of these and other factors  including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits  could impact the tax rate in future periods 
as of december  we have foreign tax credits of approximately million  expiring in through against which we recorded no valuation allowances 
additionally  we have recorded us net deferred tax assets of million  which relate to net operating losses  tax credits and other deductible temporary differences which are available to reduce taxable income in future periods  most of which do not have a definite expiration 
should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses  our effective tax rate would be negatively impacted

business segments we conduct our business through three business segments that represent our major product areas 
we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment s operating income excluding special items  such as restructuring and integration costs related to the ifc acquisition 
we believe that special items  while indicative of efforts to integrate ifc in our business  do not reflect ongoing business results 
we believe investors and other users of our financial statements can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if special items are excluded from each segment s operating income 
operating income before special items is not a recognized measure under gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to  or a better indicator of  gaap measures of performance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion of our segments 
the key operating results for our three business segments  fpd  fcd and fsd are discussed below 
flowserve pump division segment results through fpd  we design  manufacture  distribute and service engineered and industrial pumps and pump systems  replacement parts and related equipment  principally to industrial markets 
fpd has manufacturing facilities worldwide  of which nine are located in north america  in europe  four in south america and three in asia 
fpd also more than service centers  which are either free standing or co located in a manufacturing facility 
in march  we acquired the remaining interest in tkl  a leading australian designer  manufacturer and supplier of centrifugal pumps  railway track work products and steel castings 
as a result of this acquisition  we strengthened our product offering in the mining industry  broadened our manufacturing capacity in the asia pacific region and gained foundry capacity

the increase is also attributable to continued growth in the oil and gas industry 
bookings in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the increase is due to additional bookings of million resulting primarily from tkl  and an increase in aftermarket bookings 
aftermarket bookings represented of total fpd bookings in as compared with in  as our primary served markets for the oil and gas and chemicals industries experienced growth and operated at near capacity levels due to continued increases in crude oil prices 
sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with sales in north and south america increased by million and million  respectively  and excluding currency benefits 
in north america  higher sales were primarily attributable to an improvement in general industrial products as well as in parts and service in the us and canada

sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million as compared with sales improved in all regions and were most active in our core oil and gas markets 
water projects  especially those focusing on desalination  improved and chemical markets remained strong despite increasing feedstock prices 
of the increase  was directly attributable to increased sales from tkl 
offsetting these favorable sales was decreased business in our north american water market  where our sales were million lower than the previous year as fpd was more selective in bidding opportunities 
of the billion of sales in  approximately were from oil and gas  power  water  chemical and general industries 
gross profit margin increased to in as compared with in and in the increase in both years is primarily a result of the increase in sales  which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs  a higher mix of historically more profitable general industrial products and services and increased productivity 
in  these positive effects were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation of million included in cost of sales 
operating income in increased by million  or  excluding unfavorable currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase is primarily a result of the increase in gross profit margin discussed above 
operating income in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with in addition to the increased sales and gross profit margin discussed above  operating income also increased due to million in operating income from tkl and a gain of million from the involuntary conversion of patterns that were lost in a fire at one of our foundries 
these were slightly offset by an 
table of contents increase in incentive compensation of million included in cost of sales as discussed above and an incremental increase in incentive compensation of million included in sg a 
backlog in increased by million  or  excluding negative currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to the strong bookings performance in across all regions  as well as an increase in large oil and gas project orders in ema 
flow control division segment results our second largest business segment is fcd  which designs  manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of industrial valve products  including modulating and finite valves  actuators and controls 
in addition  fcd leverages its experience and application know how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio 
fcd has more than  employees at its manufacturing and service facilities in countries around the world  with only five of its manufacturing operations located in the us in  focus on execution coupled with strong operational performance in fcd s key end markets  yielded financial results above prior years 
in an effort to better align our business portfolio with our core strategic objectives  fcd made the decision to divest gsg  which provides online repair and other third party services 
effective december   we sold the assets of gsg to furmanite  a unit of dallas based xanser corporation 
we believe this divestiture allows us to continue our focus on our core end user objectives

bookings in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the increase is a result of strengthening in the chemical and the oil and gas segments of the market 
fcd sales in  increased by million  or  excluding currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the recovery of major valve markets that began in strengthened as progressed and drove sales increases to our process and power valve customers

of the million of sales in  approximately were general industry sales  were sales to chemical companies  were oil and gas industry sales and were sales to power industry customers 
sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to many of the major valve markets beginning to recover from several years of decline 
increased customer demand for valve products and services in the power  chemical and general industrial markets helped drive the sales increases 
of the million of sales in  approximately were general industry sales  were sales to chemical companies  were oil and gas industry sales and were sales to power industry customers 

table of contents gross profit margin of in increased as compared with the increase is due to our efforts to continuously monitor inventory levels  coupled with successful management of aged inventory  which resulted in a charge to cost of sales to increase the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million in  which was significantly lower as compared with the million charge recorded in further  the aforementioned volume and sales price increases with a more favorable mix of aftermarket sales  which typically have a higher margin  positively impacted gross profit margin 
gross profit margin of in decreased as compared with this resulted primarily from a million charge to cost of sales for the increase in the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory  which resulted when a comparatively large portion of inventory purchased in our acquisition of ifc in did not sell at anticipated rates  thus triggering recognition of additional obsolescence reserves 
in  operating income before special items increased million  or  excluding currency effects of less than million  driven primarily by the increase in the gross profit margin discussed above 
operating income was negatively impacted by higher sales commissions incurred to generate the sales increase  higher costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  costs incurred in expanding our footprint in asia 
operating income before special items in decreased by million  or excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the decrease results primarily from a million charge to income for the increased provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory  as discussed above  plus an incremental million increase in incentive compensation included in sg a 
special items during were associated with the acquisition and integration of ifc into fcd 
backlog in increased by million  or  excluding negative currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to the strong bookings performance in flow solutions division segment results through fsd  we design  manufacture and distribute mechanical seals  sealing systems and parts  and provide related services  principally to industrial markets 
fsd has seven manufacturing operations  three of which are located in the us fsd operates qrcs worldwide  including sites in north america  in europe  and the remainder in south america and asia 
our ability to manufacture engineered seal products within hours from the customer s request through design  engineering  manufacturing  testing and delivery is a significant competitive advantage 
based on independent industry sources  we believe that we are the second largest mechanical seal supplier in the world

we experienced strong growth in compressor and pump seals in the project business and continued success with end users due to a focus on servicing customers locally through our increasing network of qrcs 
in addition  the bookings improvement reflects fsd s success in establishing longer term customer alliance programs  including fixed fee alliances 
fixed fee alliances are contractual agreements with customers wherein the customer pays us a fixed amount each period usually monthly for the term of the agreement 
in return for this fixed cost  the customer is entitled to new seals  repairs  upgraded equipment  
table of contents replacements and maintenance services as defined within the scope of each agreement 
we believe the fixed fee strategy coupled with higher levels of customer service  reliability  drive for repair business  equipment upgrades  replacements and maintenance services have led to increases in market share in and sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the increase is due to the following strength in the oil and gas industry led by oil prices and high demand  share growth in the mineral and ore processing industry due to strong demand  and increased sales in the gas compressor business due to growth in the natural gas industry 
of the million of sales in  approximately was from oil and gas  from chemical and from general industries 
sales in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with continuous improvements focused on our end user customer business  as well as meeting our strategic growth initiatives  led fsd to increased shipments in all regions in of the million of sales in  approximately was from oil and gas  chemical and general industries 
gross profit margin increased to in as compared with primarily as a result of the ability to pass along price increases and improved product mix in the aftermarket  which typically has a higher margin 
gross profit margin for fsd decreased to in as compared with in  primarily due to a million increase in annual incentive compensation included in cost of sales  increases in worldwide metals pricing  and a charge to cost of sales resulting from an increase in the reserve for slow moving inventory 
operating income in increased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of less than million  as compared with the improvement in reflects increased gross profit margins discussed above and greater control of sg a 
operating income in decreased by million  or  excluding currency benefits of approximately million  as compared with the decrease in operating income is primarily a result of the decrease in gross profit margin discussed above and an increase in sg a  resulting from an increase in annual incentive compensation of million 
backlog in increased by million  or  excluding negative currency effects of approximately million  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to the strong bookings performance in  as well as one significant contract in which the final shipment is not due until liquidity and capital resources amounts in millions net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used by investing activities net cash flows used by financing activities cash flow analysis cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
our sources of operating cash include the sale of our products and services and the reduction of our working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventories 
our total cash balance at december  was million  compared to million in and million in the cash flows provided by operating activities in primarily reflect an increase in working capital  particularly higher accounts receivable of million from the impact of the termination of our accounts receivable securitization agreement of million 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in primarily relates to the implementation of the accounts receivable securitization agreement and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and retirement obligations and other liabilities 
in  we also benefited from receipt of a million us income tax refund 
cash outflows related to the ifc integration were million in further  operating cash flows in reflect increased funding of pension plans of approximately million as compared with the reduction in working capital for reflects increases of million in accounts payable due to deferred payment of invoices at year end in  and million in accrued liabilities due 
table of contents primarily to an increase of approximately million in the bonus accrual for the reduction in working capital for also reflects our continued emphasis on improving accounts receivable collections and reducing inventory 
the improvement in accounts receivable in as compared to primarily reflects improved collections and the impact of the accounts receivable securitization of million discussed below 
in addition  incremental factoring of certain non us receivables contributed million in  used million in and contributed million in our goal for days sales receivables outstanding dso is days 
for the fourth quarter of  we achieved a dso of days as compared to days for the same period in for reference purposes based on sales  an improvement of one day could provide approximately million in cash 
inventory reductions contributed million of cash flow for compared with million of cash flow for and million in the majority of the inventory reduction in was in project related work in process inventory required to support shipments of products in backlog  offset in part by an increase in raw materials 
as a result of inventory reductions  inventory turns were times at december   compared with times and times at december  and respectively 
for reference purposes based on data  an improvement of one turn could yield approximately million in cash 
cash outflows for investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively  due primarily to capital expenditures 
cash outflows for financing activities were million in compared with million in and million in the change in is primarily a result of the debt paydown 
the change in results primarily from increased mandatory repayments of long term debt triggered by the gmbu divestiture  the issuance of the eib credit facility and accounts receivables securitization 
our cash needs for the next months are expected to be substantially similar to  except for a decrease in debt payments required under our new credit facilities partially offset by an increase in pension contributions and increases in capital expenditures related to information technology infrastructure and capacity expansion 
we believe cash flows from operating activities  combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next months 
however  cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by economic  political and other risks associated with sales of our products  operational factors  competition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates  among other factors 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our revolving credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for the periods exceeding the next months 
we generated million and million of cash flow related to the exercise of employee stock options in and  respectively  which is reflected in financing activities of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
amounts generated from the exercise of employee stock options in were not significant 
stock option shares are not currently exercisable due to the temporary suspension of our stock option exercise program  as a result of which current employees  including executive officers  qualified retirees and our directors are unable to exercise their vested options 
the stock option exercise program was temporarily suspended due to the fact that we were not able to timely file our annual and quarterly periodic reports with the sec  which made it impossible to issue registered shares upon option exercises 
we have a substantial number of outstanding stock options granted in past years to employees under our stock option plans which have been unexercisable for an extended period due to our non current filing status of all our sec financial reports 
these outstanding options include options for  shares held by our former chairman  president and chief executive officer  c 
scott greer 
given the significant increase in our share price during the period in which optionees have been unable to exercise their options  it is possible that many holders may want to exercise soon after they are first able to do so 
we will reopen our stock option exercise program and allow optionees to exercise their options once we become current with our sec financial reporting obligations and have registered the issuance of our common shares upon exercise of such stock options with the sec 
we currently expect this to occur in if the holders of a large number of these options promptly exercise following such reopening  there would be some dilutive impact on our earnings per share 
we anticipate that a significant number of stock option exercises at one time would positively impact our cash flow  however  we are still evaluating the extent of such 
table of contents impact and alternatives to satisfy our obligation under the stock option program  up to and including repurchasing shares on the market to offset some or all of the dilutive impact on our earnings per share which could negatively impact our cash flow 
the impacts on our cash flow and earnings per share are dependent upon share price  number of shares and strike price of shares exercised 
payments for acquisitions we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes 
the cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition  including our ability to raise economical capital  is a critical consideration in any such evaluation 
in march  we acquired the remaining interest in tkl for approximately million 
we paid for the acquisition with cash generated by operations 
prior to the acquisition  we held a interest in tkl 
as a result of this acquisition  we strengthened our product offering in the mining industry  broadened our manufacturing capacity in the asia pacific region and gained foundry capacity 
capital expenditures amounts in millions capital expenditures depreciation expense capital expenditures were funded primarily by operating cash flows and  to a lesser extent  by bank borrowings 
in  our capital expenditures focused on new product development  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities 
in and  capital expenditures were invested in new and replacement machinery and equipment  information technology and acquisition integration activities  including structures and equipment required at receiving facilities 
capital expenditures in include approximately million for the purchase of a building we previously leased for the manufacture of valves 
in each year  capital expenditures were less than depreciation expense due to excess capacity and the upgrading of equipment through integration processes 
in  our capital expenditures are focused on capacity expansion  enterprise resource planning application upgrades project star simplification and teamwork accelerates results  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between million and million 
certain of our facilities may face capacity constraints in the foreseeable future  which may lead to higher capital expenditure levels

the following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at december  commitment expiration by period within beyond year years years years total amounts in millions letters of credit surety bonds we expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
plan description we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
the defined benefit pension plan in the us is the flowserve corporation pension plan and the defined contribution plan is the flowserve corporation retirement savings plan 

table of contents approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and of benefit obligations are related to the us plan as of december  the assets for the us plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to total plans ie  the ie plan together with international plans 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
at december   the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit plans increased to million from million at december  assets were allocated as follows us plan us plans asset category equity securities fixed income other the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
none of our common stock is directly held by these plans 
we sponsor a defined benefit postretirement health care plan covering most current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us this plan provides for medical and dental benefits and is administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plan as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plan are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement health care plan was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of plan amendments in that reduced our obligation from full coverage to a capped amount at two facilities and a higher than expected decrease in plan participants 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits  such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants and assumed rate of wage increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
the assumed discount rate used for determining future pension obligations is based on indices of aa rated corporate bonds  except for two foreign locations which use government bonds 
the assumed rate of compensation increase used for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels  productivity  seniority and other factors 
in  net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was million compared to million in and million in the postretirement benefit expense for the postretirement health care plan was million in compared to million in 
table of contents and million in the decline in is primarily attributable to plan amendments capping our liabilities and to a decrease in the number of participants 
the following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans for the year ended december  us plan us plans weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost long term rate of return on assets discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels the following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the us qualified and aggregate us pension plans and us postretirement plans

at december   we lowered our assumed discount rate for the us plan from to consistent with decreased year bond yields and our average rate for non us plans from to 
we maintained our average assumed rate of compensation increase at for the us plan and slightly increased the assumed rate of compensation increase to for non us plans 
the reduction in the discount rate had the 
table of contents effect of increasing the present value of benefit obligations and  accordingly  increased pension expense for we lowered the expected rate of return on us plan assets from for to for  primarily to reflect reduced expected long term equity returns 
further reductions to the assumed discount rate and expected rate of return will have the effect of increasing pension expense for we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately million higher in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the decrease in the assumed discount rate and expected reduction in the rate of return on plan assets 
we expect the expense for the postretirement health care plan to be million 
we have used the same assumed discount rates of and at december  and  respectively  in calculating our cost of pension benefits and our cost of other postretirement benefits for us plans 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in per capita costs for periods prior to medicare were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare act 
the effects of the medicare act are reflected in net periodic postretirement benefit cost a reduction of million and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  a reduction of million 
delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses at december  and  unrecognized net actuarial losses for our defined benefit plans were million and million  respectively  based on the fair market value of plan assets 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses primarily reflect in large part the steady reduction of the weighted average discount rate over the years 
sfas no 
provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses  including amounts arising from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate  differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets  and other assumption changes 
sfas no 
requires that unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss  determined based on the market related value of plan assets which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years  be amortized in pension expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 
these net gains and losses are recognized as pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years 
at december   the unrecognized net actuarial loss for the us plan subject to amortized recognition  determined based on the market related value of plan assets  was million 
this amount exceeded of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by million 
unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets  amortization of this unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense for each of the following years by approximately million per year  which amount is reflected in the higher expense expected in in the event the fair market value of pension plan assets of a particular plan is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for such plan at year end  gaap may require an additional minimum liability  and in such circumstances  a reduction in shareholders equity or an establishment of an intangible asset 
at december   the fair market value of our defined benefit pension plan assets was million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was million 
we recognized an additional minimum liability of million at december   which was recorded as a million charge in other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity  a million deferred tax asset  and a million intangible asset 
at december   the fair market value of our defined benefit pension plan assets was million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was million 
we recognized an additional minimum liability of million at december   which 
table of contents was recorded as a million charge in other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  a million deferred tax asset  and a million increase in the intangible asset 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
in  we expect to contribute approximately million to our qualified us pension plan  and we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans 
for further discussions on retirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include timing and amount of revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory costing and related fair value allowances  deferred tax asset realization  restructuring charges and expected payments reflected in related reserves  legal and environmental claims estimates  warranty provisions  pension and postretirement benefits obligations and the fair value of indefinite lived assets including goodwill and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management with oversight by our disclosure control committee  an internal committee comprised of members of senior management  and the disclosure control committee presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues for products and short term projects are recognized based on the shipping terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions required  which is generally the point of title transfer 
if the customer order requires formal acceptance  revenue is not recognized until formal acceptance has been received 
for contracts containing multiple products  each having separable value  we generally recognize revenue on individual product shipments equal to the shipped products pro rata share of the contract s fair value upon the fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions of the individual product shipment 
for multiple deliverables under a single contract or arrangement  such as product delivery and installation  we separate the fair value of the product from the installation and recognize revenue on each element independently upon fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
our estimates mainly relate to the fair value determination of the underlying services or products 
revenue on service contracts is recognized after the services have been rendered and accepted by the customer 
all revenue for products  short term projects and service contracts require  prior to recognition  the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility 
revenue for certain long term large contracts is recorded on the percentage of completion method calculated on a cost to cost basis  in instances where reliable cost estimates exist 
percentage of completion revenue represents 
table of contents less than of our consolidated revenues for each year presented  and is most prevalent in fpd 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress  and in doing so we make judgments to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in scheduled delivery and the cost of materials  labor costs and productivity  the impact of change orders  potential warranty liabilities and liquidated damage claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and resultant contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenue generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for five years 
fixed fee service and repair contracts represent less than of our consolidated revenue for each year presented  and are most prevalent in fsd 
in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet schedule or agreed upon delivery dates can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payments of such costs are likely  we perform project profitability analysis using such costs to reduce revenues realizable  which could cause estimated project costs to exceed projected revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in instances where the reduced revenues still exceed costs  the incurrence of the costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable 
the amount of the allowance is determined principally based upon the aging of the receivable  as well as on customer credit history  significant customer disputes  outstanding industry and market segment information  economic trends and conditions  credit reports and customer financial condition 
we consider our collection history and specifically known uncollectible accounts in establishing our allowance 
customer credit issues  customer bankruptcies  general economic conditions or other matters largely beyond our control can affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
if our customers financial conditions worsened or if customer disputes increased beyond levels currently provided for  we might be required to recognize additional allowances or incur additional write offs  which would adversely impact our results of operation  cash flows and financial position 
our credit risk may be mitigated by our large number of customers across many different geographic regions 
for all of and most of  we had a credit insurance policy for many of our european subsidiaries  whereby we were entitled to remuneration from the third party insurer  net of deductible  in instances where customers covered by this policy were unable to pay 
we cancelled this policy in late due to minimal claims sought 
inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we primarily determine cost for the majority of our us inventories by the last in  first out method and for other inventories by the first in  first out method 
we estimate the market value of our inventory based on an assessment of recent or committed sales prices  and provide for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage  estimated future demand and related pricing 
in determining excess quantities  we consider recent sales activity  related margins and market positioning of our products 
these estimates are generally not subject to significant volatility  due to the long life cycles of our product lines  except for product rationalizations generally associated with acquisition integration programs 
however  factors beyond our control  such as demand levels  technological advances and pricing competition  could change from period to period 
if such factors had an adverse effect on us  we might be required to reduce the value of our inventory  which would adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 

table of contents deferred taxes and tax valuation allowances we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
tax reserves the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for certain positions that are subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest as deemed appropriate 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
restructuring and integration expense restructuring and integration expenses have generally been recognized in conjunction with our acquisitions 
such expenses reflect many estimates including costs pertaining to employee severance payments  fulfillment of outstanding contractual obligations and other matters associated with exiting a facility 
restructuring costs related to facilities and employees of acquired businesses generally become a component of goodwill  whereas non acquisition related restructuring costs are recorded as restructuring expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
integration costs are recognized as a reduction to the results of operations as a component of current earnings 
reserves created for each restructuring plan are assessed quarterly and adjusted for any revisions of cost estimates or other changes in planned restructuring activities 
prior to january   we recognized restructuring reserves when the related restructuring plans had been both approved and communicated to affected employees 
in conjunction with adopting sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january   we now record restructuring reserves as the related liability is incurred 
legal and environmental accruals the costs relating to legal and environmental liabilities are recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
we have a formal process for assessing the facts and recording any required reserves on a case by case basis 
assessments of legal and environmental reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
warranty accruals warranty obligations are based upon product failure rates  materials usage and service delivery costs  an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve such claims 
the estimates of expected claims are generally a factor of historical claims and known product issues 
warranty obligations based on 
table of contents these factors are adjusted based on historical sales trends for the preceding months 
changes in claim rates  differences between actual and expected warranty costs  sales trends  and facility rationalization activities could impact warranty obligation estimates  which might have adverse effects to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
retirement and postretirement benefits determination of the value of our retirement and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions which are assessed annually in the fourth quarter and which include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants  assumed rate of wage increases  and assumed rate of health care cost increases 
we evaluate  in conjunction with our professional advisors  prevailing market conditions in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
specifically for our us plan  we assess such market factors as changes in the cash balance interest crediting rate  borrowing rates for investment grade corporate and industrial companies  assumptions used by fortune companies  our actual wage increases in recent years  expected rates of return for each targeted asset class held by the plans and return premiums generated by active investment management 
for the non us plans we perform similar analyses  but also factor in local laws and requirements 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers and discuss our key assumptions  prior to their incorporation into actuarial calculations  with the finance committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets our business acquisitions typically generate goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect prospective amortization expense and possible impairment expense we might incur 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
impairment losses for intangibles are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which correlate to our operating segments 
the test of indefinite lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data used in discounting those cash flows 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital of  which is applicable to our company and industry based on published data 
the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing methodologies similar to that for goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents accounting developments we have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
outlook for we experienced strengthening in our markets in and we remain optimistic about our markets and our performance in  considering that the economic opportunities in many of our geographic and core industrial markets continue to be strong 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are expected to increase from  excluding currency fluctuations 
for additional discussion on our markets  see the business overview our markets section of this management s discussion and analysis 
our bookings have increased for the three months ended march  as compared to the same period in however  as a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in the same increase in revenues 
we expect our operating income to increase in as compared with  although there are a numbers of factors that could have a significant impact on our operating income in our operating income should continue to benefit from a number of operational improvement programs  including the procurement program and the cip initiative  as well as other operational improvements in several of our facilities 
in addition  continuation of our end user strategy  selective contract bidding and an increase in our quick turnaround products  which are historically more profitable  should also positively contribute to our operating income in however  a number of significant costs and certain other expenses will negatively impact our operating income in these include selected investments in technology infrastructure to consolidate our erp systems  enhancements to our cip initiative  professional fees incurred in the development of tax strategies and enhancement of our compliance programs  an increase in research and development spending  a continued high level of professional fees primarily related to the restatement of our financial results for  and the first quarter of  and the and audits  including section assessments  which were all completed in the first half of  initiation of the audit and section assessment  non cash stock compensation expenses primarily related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment and re measurement and modification of certain stock options  and higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation 
in addition  we may experience capacity constraints at several of our plant locations in which could cause delays in shipping and payment of liquidated damages 
if these factors occur as we have described  we expect net earnings and net earnings per share to improve in there is potential for the exercise of a significant amount of stock options in which will become exercisable after we become current with our required filings with the sec 
the exercise of the stock options could have a dilutive effect on net earnings per share 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis for further discussion 
following the refinancing of the credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes in august  of our debt carries a floating rate of interest 
as of december  we had million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
as a result of our refinancing and lower levels of debt in  we expect our interest expense will be lower in as compared to however  because a large portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest  the debt is subject to volatility in rates  which could negatively affect interest expense 
in addition  we do not expect to incur losses on debt extinguishment in as were incurred during the re financing during we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business  capital expenditures  pension plan contribution obligations and costs of compliance  and continue to reduce debt levels 
we expect to improve working capital utilization by reducing dso and increasing inventory turns 
however  the amount of cash generated from working capital is dependent on the level of revenues and other factors 
in our capital expenditures are focused on capacity expansion  enterprise resource planning application upgrades  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between million and million  before consideration of any acquisition activity 
currently  no significant acquisitions are imminent 
while current pension regulations allow us latitude in the amount of contributions  we currently anticipate that our contributions to our qualified us pension plan will be between million and million in we currently anticipate that our 
table of contents contributions to our non us pension plans will be approximately million in we have no scheduled repayments in under the new credit facilities  however we made a mandatory repayment of million in january using the net cash proceeds from the sale of gsg and we will make a mandatory repayment of million in july using excess cash flows 
we expect to comply with the covenants under our new credit facilities in see the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis for further discussion of our debt covenants 
the potential exercise of a significant amount of stock options in see preceding paragraph could generate a significant amount of cash in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments we have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we enter into forward contracts to hedge our risks associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the operation engaging in the transaction 
our risk management and derivatives policy specifies the conditions under which we may enter into derivative contracts 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding forward contracts with third parties 
at december   the maximum length of any forward contract currently in place was months 
certain of our forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  and was a net liability of million and a net asset of million  respectively 
unrealized gains losses from the changes in the fair value of these forward contracts of approximately million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in other expense income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of outstanding forward contracts qualifying for hedge accounting was a net liability of  and million at december  and  respectively 
unrealized gains losses from the changes in the fair value of qualifying forward contracts and the associated underlying exposures of  million  and million  net of tax  as of december   and  respectively  are included in other comprehensive income expense in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
also as part of our risk management program  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to floating interest rates on term loans 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties 
at december   the maximum length of any interest rate contract currently in place was approximately three years 
at december  and  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of million and a net liability of million  respectively 
during  we entered into a compound derivative contract to hedge exposure to both currency translation and interest rate risks associated with our european investment bank eib loan 
the notional amount of the derivative was million  and it served to convert floating rate interest rate risk to a fixed rate  as well as us dollar currency risk to euros 
the derivative matures in at december  and  the fair value of this derivative was a net liability of million and million  respectively 
the unrealized gain loss on the derivative  offset with the foreign transaction gain on the underlying loan aggregate to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are included in other expense income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to risk from credit related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments 
we perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations 
we have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties 
our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  
table of contents we had approximately million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would change interest expense by approximately million 
we employ a foreign currency hedging strategy to minimize potential losses in earnings or cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these strategies also minimize potential gains from favorable exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated back into us dollars 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december  and before consideration of any outstanding forward contracts  a adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations by million
