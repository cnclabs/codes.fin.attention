specifically  the company recognized  in additional depreciation and amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operation for the quarter ended december  to correct the aforementioned error in accounting 
we decided to record the correction in the current period and not restate our previously issued financial statements after taking into consideration i that the adjustment  net of applicable income taxes  did not have a material impact on the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods taken as a whole  and ii that the cumulative impact of the adjustment on stockholders equity was not material to the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods 
costs of terminated acquisitions our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated 
the costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately   and in  and  respectively 
these costs  which principally related to several possible acquisitions we pursued in the security segment  are primarily related to due diligence costs 
asset impairment charges in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  and assets to be disposed of  for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value  net of costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately million 
the asset write down related to one of our full service car wash sites in texas and two full service car wash sites in arizona 
we have determined that due to changing demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites  their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
during the quarter ended june   we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in arizona  which we partially wrote down at december   by an additional  the additional write down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the site s carrying value

additionally  during the year ended december   we wrote down assets related to our truck wash operations determined to be impaired by approximately  and we wrote these assets down an additional  during the quarter ended september  as a result of our sfas quarterly reviews 
we have determined that due to a reduction in truck wash volumes resulting from an increase in inclement weather  increased competition  the significant increase in fuel costs which had the effect of reducing spending on truck washing  and demographic changes to certain of our facilities  their future expected cash flows would not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
the company executed a lease to sell agreement on december  with eagle united truck wash  llc eagle to lease mace s five truck washes beginning january  for up to two years 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  eagle must pay mace  per month to lease the company s truck washes  and is responsible for all underlying property expenses 
within the next two years  eagle is obligated under the agreement to purchase the truck washes and be delivered title to the assets for million  consideration consisting of  cash and a  note payable to mace secured by mortgages on the truck washes 
when issued  the  note will have a five year term  with principal and interest paid on a year amortization schedule 
if eagle does not fulfill its obligation to purchase the truck washes  the company will regain possession of the truck washes and eagle will be obligated to pay  as liquidated damages 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our texas region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairments of approximately million and million related to our northeast and texas reporting units  respectively 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our northeast region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment 
these  and impairments were principally due to reductions in future projected cash flows resulting from extended departures from our historic revenue levels as a result of inclement weather  and increased competition near several of our facilities in texas and new jersey 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december   was million compared to million for this decrease in our net interest expense was the result of an increase in interest income  partially offset by an increase in interest rates in on approximately of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate

in and no income tax benefit was recorded with respect to the northeast region reporting unit goodwill impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively  due to the non deductibility of the goodwill 
the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs related to intangibles  and changes to the valuation allowance 
in we wrote off approximately  of state net operating loss carryforwards nol related to our truck washes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors  including the company s ability to generate taxable income in future years 
the company performed a detailed review of the considerations influencing our ability to realize the future benefit of the nols  including  the extent of recently used nols  the turnaround of future deductible temporary differences  the duration of the nol carryforward period  and the company s future projection of taxable income 
the company increased its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million in with a total valuation allowance of million at december  representing the amount of its deferred income tax assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
this determination was a result of the company s continued losses in its fiscal year ended december   the uncertainty of the timing of the company s transition from the car wash business  and the ultimate extent of growth in the company s security segment 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash and cash equivalents were million at december  the ratio of our total debt to total capitalization  which consists of total debt plus stockholders equity  was at december   and at december  the improvements in the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio is directly related to routine principal payments on debt as noted below 
our business requires a substantial amount of capital  most notably to pursue our expansion strategies  including our current expansion in the security segment  and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our car and truck wash segment 
we plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources  including borrowings  internally generated funds  and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the company s stock is at a desirable level 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million 
at december   working capital was approximately million and  at december  the reduction in working capital at december  was principally due to a use of million of cash for the acquisition of securetek in november we experienced a significant improvement in working capital at december   primarily attributable to million of proceeds received from the removal of a restriction on outstanding shares of the company s common stock  million of proceeds  net of issuance costs  from the sale of approximately million shares of the company s common stock to two private institutions through three separate sale transactions and the sale of  shares of the company s stock to fusion under a master facility agreement  million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  and  of proceeds from the sale of an exterior only car wash in new jersey and a full service car wash in arizona 
working capital was also positively affected in by the renewal and reclassification to non current liabilities of approximately million of year amortizing loans with chase 
the increase in working capital in was partially offset by the use of million of cash for the acquisitions of ivs and s m on july   capital expenditure investments for further growth within the car and truck wash segment and the security segment  as more fully detailed below  and the reclassification to current liabilities of an additional loan for  which was renewed in april although the company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past  including the renewal of loans in and totaling  and million  respectively  there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms 
during the years ended december  and  we made capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  within our car and truck wash segment 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our car and truck wash segment of approximately  for the year ending december  the company believes its current cash and short term investment balance at december  of million and cash flow from operating activities in the remainder of will be sufficient to meet its car wash capital expenditure funding needs through at least the next twelve months 
in years subsequent to  we estimate that our car and truck wash segment will require annual capital expenditures of  to  capital expenditures within our car and truck wash segment are necessary to maintain the efficiency and competitiveness of our sites 
if the cash provided from operating activities does not improve in and future years and if current cash balances are depleted  we will need to raise additional capital to meet these ongoing capital requirements 
capital expenditures for our security segment were  and million for the fiscal years ending december  and  respectively 
we used million of cash for the acquisition of securetek in november we spent approximately million through june  in the initial development of our video surveillance systems operations in ft 
lauderdale  florida including the acquisition costs of micro tech and vernex and the cost of developing and purchasing inventory for our expanded product line 
additionally  on july  the company paid approximately million of cash for the acquisition of the s m and ivs security operations 
we also made capital expenditures in of approximately million for the purchase and furnishing of a new facility in farmers branch  texas for our s m and ivs security operations 
approximately  of the farmers branch  texas facility purchase price was financed with debt 
we estimate capital expenditures for the security segment at approximately  for  principally related to facility improvements and equipment for our farmers branch  texas and ft 
lauderdale  florida operations 
we intend to continue to expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we grow and introduce new video surveillance products in and in years subsequent to we anticipate that inventory purchases will be funded from cash collected from sales and working capital 
at december   we maintained an unused  revolving credit facility with chase to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases 
this revolving credit facility is subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable as defined in our bank agreement 
based upon availability calculations at december   the full amount of the revolving credit facility is currently available 
the amount of capital that we will spend in and in years subsequent to is largely dependent on the marketing success we achieve with our video surveillance systems and components 
we believe our cash and short term investments balance of million at december  and the revolving credit facility will provide for growth in unless our operating cash flow improves  our growth will be limited if we deplete our cash balance 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing by selling common stock and obtaining mortgage loans 
our ability to obtain new financing can be adversely impacted by our stock price 
our failure to maintain the required current debt service coverage ratios on existing loans also adversely impacts our ability to obtain additional financing 
we are reluctant to sell common stock at market prices below our per share book value 
for the twelve month period ended december  we were in default on certain of our debt covenants 
we obtained waivers from our lenders through january  our ability to obtain new financing will be limited if our stock price is not above our per share book value and our cash from operating activities does not improve 
currently  we cannot incur additional long term debt without the approval of one of our commercial lenders 
the company must demonstrate that the cash flow benefit from the use of new loan proceeds exceeds the resulting future debt service requirements 
debt capitalization and other financing arrangements at december   we had borrowings  including capital lease obligations  of approximately million 
we had three letters of credit outstanding at december   totaling  as collateral relating to workers compensation insurance policies 
we maintain a  revolving credit facility  subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable  to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  the company also maintains a  line of credit for commercial letters of credit for the importation of inventory 
there were no outstanding commercial letters of credit under this commitment at december  several of our debt agreements  as amended  contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth  maintenance of certain unencumbered cash and marketable securities balances  limitations on capital spending and the maintenance of certain debt service coverage ratios on a consolidated level 
at december   we were not in compliance with our semi annual consolidated debt coverage ratio of at least related to our gmac notes payable 
the company s debt coverage ratio related to the gmac notes payable was at december  additionally  the mace guaranty agreement with gmac requires the company to provide gmac audited  reviewed  or compiled financial statements by the company s independent certified public accountants within days of the company s fiscal year end 
the company was not able to timely provide the required year end audited financial statements 
gmac granted us a waiver of acceleration related to the non compliance with the debt coverage ratio covenant and delinquency in providing the company s year end audited financial statements at december   and for measurement periods through april  and  accordingly  a portion of the gmac notes payable was reflected as non current on our financial statements at december  if we are not able to increase our debt coverage ratio to at least  or we cannot obtain further waivers of acceleration  the gmac notes may be reflected as current in future balance sheets and as a result our stock price may decline 
the company has entered into amendments to the chase term loan agreements effective march  the amended debt coverage ratio with chase requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service of at december  and thereafter 
the company s debt coverage ratio was at december  which was in compliance with this chase covenant as amended 
the amended chase term loan agreement also limits capital expenditures annually to million and requires the company to provide chase with a form k and audited financial statements within days of the company s fiscal year end as well as internal certified financial statements and a form q within days after the end of each fiscal quarter 
the company was not able to timely provide the required year end audited financial statements or the first quarter form q 
the company incurred capital expenditures of million in and  accordingly  was not in compliance with this chase covenant 
the company received a waiver of acceleration from chase at december  and for measurement periods through january  related to exceeding the annual capital expenditure limit and the untimely financial statement filings and  accordingly  a portion of the chase notes payable was reflected as non current on our financial statements at december  the chase amendment also requires the maintenance of a minimum total unencumbered cash and marketable securities balance of million 
this cash balance requirement will be lowered to million upon the company returning to a debt coverage ratio of at least to if we are unable to satisfy these covenants or obtain further waivers  the chase notes may be reflected as current in future balance sheets and as a result our stock price may decline 
the company sold or closed six unprofitable or marginally profitable car wash facilities and a lube facility in  and and increased its prices in march within the car and truck wash segment to help improve cash flows for fiscal and if our future cash flows are less than expected or debt service including interest expense increases more than expected causing us to further default on any of the chase covenants or the gmac covenant in the future  the company will need to obtain further amendments or waivers from these lenders 
if the company is unable to obtain waivers or amendments in the future  chase debt currently totaling million and gmac debt currently totaling million  including debt recorded as long term debt at december   would become payable on demand by the financial institution upon expiration of the current waivers 
the company s ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow 
our cash flow has been and could continue to be adversely affected by weather patterns  economic conditions  and the requirements to fund the growth of our security business 
in the event that non compliance with the debt covenants should reoccur  the company would pursue various alternatives to attempt to successfully resolve the non compliance  which might include  among other things  seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments  or refinancing debt with other financial institutions 
there can be no assurance that further debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained or that the debt would be refinanced with other financial institutions at favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain renewals on maturing loans or refinancing of loans on favorable terms  our ability to operate would be materially and adversely affected

due to the ongoing nature of the criminal investigation  it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of the investigation or the impact of costs of ultimately resolving this matter 
however  we believe that additional legal and other costs and expenses through the remainder of may be significant as we work to resolve the criminal investigation 
in addition  we may be required to make substantial payments for fines  penalties or settlements in connection with the resolution of alleged violations of laws 
any such expenses or payments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources

seasonality and inflation the company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by periods of inclement weather 
in particular  long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affect our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods 
additionally  extended periods of warm  dry weather  usually encountered during the company s third quarter  may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business 
the company has attempted to mitigate the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse geographic regions 
the company also experiences a seasonal reduction in volume during the third quarter within the company s arizona and florida regions as a result of a migration of a significant portion of those areas populations to cooler climates 
the company does not believe its security operations are subject to seasonality

summary of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenues from the company s car and truck wash segment are recognized  net of customer coupon discounts  when services are rendered or fuel or merchandise is sold 
the company records a liability for gift certificates  ticket books  and seasonal and annual passes sold at its car care locations but not yet redeemed 
the company estimates these unredeemed amounts based on gift certificate and ticket book sales and redemptions throughout the year as well as utilizing historical sales and tracking of redemption rates per the car washes point of sale systems 
seasonal and annual passes are amortized on a straight line basis over the time during which the passes are valid 
revenues from the company s security segment are recognized when shipments are made

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less  and credit card deposits which are converted into cash within two to three business days 
short term investments at december   the company had approximately million of investments classified as available for sale in three funds which are stated at market value 
the company may exit one of the funds at the end of any calendar quarter with days advanced written notice and the other funds may be exited with one business day notice 
in the year ended december   the company realized a total gain of  additionally  an unrealized gain  net of tax  of approximately  is included as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  and assets to be disposed of  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets  rather than a single asset 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company completed annual impairment tests as of november    and  and will be subject to an impairment test each year thereafter and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
the company s annual impairment testing corresponds with the company s determination of its annual operating budgets for the upcoming year 
the company s valuation of goodwill is based on a discounted cash flow model applying an appropriate discount rate to future expected cash flows and management s annual review of historical data and future assessment of certain critical operating factors  including security product sales and related costs  car wash volumes  average car wash and detailing revenue rates per car  wash and detailing labor cost percentages  weather trends and recent and expected operating cost levels 
estimating cash flows requires significant judgment including factors beyond our control and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
adverse business conditions could affect recoverability of goodwill in the future and  accordingly  the company may record additional impairments in subsequent years 
other intangible assets other intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs  customer lists  product lists  trademarks  and a registered national brand name 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  our trademarks and brand name are considered to have indefinite lives  and as such  are not subject to amortization 
these assets are tested for impairment using discounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
several impairment indicators are beyond our control  and cannot be predicted with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective debt instruments 
customer lists  product lists  and non compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax expense benefit represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized

interest rate exposure a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  and as such  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
substantially all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate  as is our incremental borrowing rate 
a one percent increase in the prime and libor rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at december  and would have had the impact of increasing interest expense by approximately  in on october   we entered into an interest rate cap that effectively changes our interest rate exposure on approximately million of variable rate debt
