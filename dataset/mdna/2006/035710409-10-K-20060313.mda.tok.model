item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a self managed real estate investment trust reit that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities and agency debentures 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans collectively  mortgage backed securities 
we also invest in federal home loan bank fhlb  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and federal national mortgage association fnma debentures 
the mortgage backed securities and agency debentures are collectively referred to herein as investment securities 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to rated high quality mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
we may acquire mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  all of the mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining our status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold assets and began purchasing assets in the current rate environment 
with the federal funds interest rate continuing to rise in the fourth quarter of the year  the company sold lower yielding assets and began replacing them with higher yielding assets 
certain assets that were purchased in the much lower interest rate environment of and are unlikely to recover to their amortized cost basis and were not providing attractive returns on a cash flow basis 
we have shortened contractual maturities on borrowings  such that our weighted average contractual maturity on our repurchase agreements was days at december   as compared to days at december  the reason maturities have shortened is because the three year repurchase agreements are closer to maturity date 
additional three year repurchase agreements have not been entered into  due to the level of funding rates being offered 
the table below provides quarterly information regarding our average balances  interest income  interest expense  yield on assets  cost of funds and net interest income for the quarterly periods presented 
yield on average average average net investment total interest balance of average interest securities interest earning repurchase interest cost of income net interest held income assets agreements expense funds loss rate spread ratios for the quarters have been annualized  dollars in thousands quarter ended december       quarter ended september       quarter ended june       quarter ended march       does not reflect unrealized gains losses 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
market valuation of investment securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part our overall management of our portfolio 
accordingly  we are required to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to obtain market values from independent sources 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
investments with unrealized losses are not considered other than temporarily impaired if the company has the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
unrealized losses on investment securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in income and the cost basis of the investment securities is adjusted 
other than temporary impaired losses on securities totaled million at december  there were no such adjustments for the years ended december  and interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of our investment securities through the use of repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective agreements 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit and intend to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company will not be subjected to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company and fidac have made a joint election to treat fidac as a taxable reit subsidiary 
as such  fidac is taxable as a domestic c corporation and subject to federal and state and local income taxes based upon its taxable income 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december   our net loss was million or basic loss per average share related to common shareholders  as compared to million net income or basic earnings per average share for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was million or basic earnings per average share related to common shareholders 
net income per average share decreased by and total net income decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  we attribute the decrease in total net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  to the decline in interest rate spread  losses on sales of securities  and losses on other than temporarily impaired securities 
the interest rate spread decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the total amortization for the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
for the year ended december   net loss on sale of mortgage backed securities was million  as compared to a net gain of million in the table below presents the net loss income summary for the years ended december      and net loss income summary dollars in the thousands  except for per share data year ended year ended year ended december december  december  interest income    interest expense    net interest income    other loss income investment advisory and service fees   loss gain on sale of investment securities    loss on other than temporarily impaired securities  total other loss income    expenses distribution fees   general and administrative expenses    total expenses    income before income taxes    income taxes   net loss income    dividends on preferred stock   net loss income related to common shareholders    weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding    weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding    basic net loss income per average common share diluted net loss income per average common share average total assets    average equity    return on average total assets return on average equity interest income and average earning asset yield we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  our primary source of income is interest income 
our interest income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the yield on average investment securities was   and for the respective periods 
interest expense and the cost of funds we anticipate that our largest expense will be the cost of borrowed funds 
we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  and for the year december  the cost of funds rate increased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  interest expense for the year increased by million over the prior year due to the substantial increase in the average repurchase balance and the increase in the cost of funds rate 
the cost of funds rate increased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million over the previous year due to the increase in the average repurchase balance and substantial increase in the cost of funds rate 
since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  changes in market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
our average cost of funds was below average one month libor and below average six month libor for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was above average one month libor and below average six month libor for the year ended december  since the federal reserve continued to raise the federal funds rate after december   we will experience an increase in funding cost

our net interest spread  which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this basis point decrease was the result in the increased funding cost of basis points  offset by the increase in yield of basis points 
our net interest income increased million for the year ended december  over the prior year 
our net interest income increased because of the increase in our assets that resulted from the common stock and preferred stock offerings during the table below shows our interest income by earning asset type  average earning assets by type  total interest income  interest expense  average repurchase agreements  average cost of funds  and net interest income for the years ended december      and and the four quarters in net interest income ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized  dollars in thousands average average average net investment total yield average balance of cost net interest securities interest interest repurchase interest of interest rate held income earning assets agreements expense funds income spread for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the quarter ended december       for the quarter ended september       for the quarter ended june       for the quarter ended march       investment advisory and service fees fidac is a registered investment advisor that generally receives annual net investment advisory fees of approximately to basis points of the gross assets it manages  assists in managing or supervises 
at december   fidac had under management approximately billion in net assets and billion in gross assets  compared to billion in net assets and billion in gross assets at december  net investment advisory and service fees for the year ended december  totaled million  net of fees paid to third parties pursuant to distribution service agreements for facilitating and promoting distribution of shares or units to fidac s clients 
gross assets under management will vary from time to time because of changes in the amount of net assets fidac manages as well as changes in the amount of leverage used by the various funds and accounts fidac manages 
although net assets under management increased by approximately million from december  to december   net assets under management began to decline after september  due both to the reduction of their market value and redemptions 
in addition  during the first quarter of  fidac was notified that an additional million in net assets would be removed from its management although fidac would continue to receive advisory fees on these assets until june  fidac s net advisory fees are included in our consolidated financial statements post our acquisition of fidac on june  gains and losses on sales of investment securities for the year ended december   we sold investment securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of billion for an aggregate loss of million 
for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of billion for an aggregate gain of million 
the loss on sale of assets for the year ended december  was due to portfolio rebalancing that was initiated in the fourth quarter of we determined that certain assets purchased in a much lower interest rate environment of and were unlikely to receive their amortized cost basis  and commenced selling these assets 
the rebalancing was done with the objective of improving future financial performance 
during the year ended december  the amount of sales were higher than in prior years  with the majority of sales occurring during the second quarter 
the sales in occurred because of declining interest rates  which caused fixed rate securities to appreciate significantly and we determined to take advantage of the appreciation 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  declined by million over the prior year 
the difference between the sale price and the historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities is a realized gain and increases income accordingly 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy 
loss on other than temporarily impaired securities during the fourth quarter of  in connection with the portfolio rebalancing discussed above  the company reviewed each of its securities to determine if an other than temporary impairment charge would be necessary 
it was determined that certain securities that were in an unrealized loss position  the company did not intend to hold them for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
approximately billion face amount of securities were reclassified as other than temporarily impaired  with an approximate loss of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative or g a expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  g a expenses as a percentage of average total assets was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in g a expenses of million for the year december   was primarily the result of increased salaries  directors and officers insurance and additional costs related to fidac

the increase in our net income in  from  was the result of us deploying additional capital of approximately million from december  to december  into our strategy

during the year ended december   the annual prepayment speed was the highest in our history at 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

weighted average annual period cap weighted average lifetime cap at december  investment principal value as percentage of investment securities at december  borrowings to date  our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our investment securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts which we believe are in excess of our needs 
all of our investment securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional investment securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our investment securities varies 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our investment securities could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements decreased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  the decrease in borrowings was the result of lower assets from the sale of securities to facilitate the repositioning of our portfolio and lower borrowing capacity from the decline in equity 
we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increase due to changes in market interest rates of market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the our mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position

we continue to operate as a self managed and self advised real estate investment trust  with fidac operating as our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary 
fidac s shareholders may also receive additional shares of our common stock as an earn out in worth up to  if fidac meets specific performance goals under the merger agreement 
we cannot calculate how many shares we will issue under the earn out provisions since that will vary depending upon whether and the extent to which fidac achieves specific performance goals 
even if fidac achieves specific performance goals for a fiscal year  the number of additional shares to be issued to the fidac shareholders will vary depending on our average share price for the first trading days of the following fiscal year 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful

all of the mortgage backed securities are aaa rated or carry an implied aaa rating 
at december   billion in mortgage backed securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  which resulted in a loss of million 
at september   our investments that were in a loss position were not considered other than temporarily impaired since at the time the company had the intent to hold them for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
with the continued increase in the federal funds rate during the quarter  however  management determined during the fourth quarter that it did not intend to hold some of its securities until maturity and would reposition a portion of its assets 
the remaining investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired since the company currently has the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time to maturity  if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
also  the company is guaranteed payment on the par value of the securities 
the table below shows our equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december      and and september   june  and march  issuances of common stock  the level of earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors influence our historical cost equity capital base 
the reported equity capital base is influenced by these factors plus changes in the net unrealized gains losses on assets available for sale account

we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we will cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of investment securities by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
we agree to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
the interest rate swap had not settled as of december  we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we will seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that our qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  are of our total assets at december  and as compared to the internal revenue code requirement that at least of our total assets be qualified reit assets 
we also calculate that and  respectively  of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  and of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  under the reit rules for the years ended december  and we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  as of december   and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december     and we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our investment securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we have utilized interest rate swaps  and interest rate caps and floors and we may in the future utilize a variety of other financial instruments  including interest rate caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
our use of these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities may subject us to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates go up or down by basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december   and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if based on actual prepayment experience 
more than within year to years and months months years over total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets investment securities principal      rate sensitive liabilities repurchase agreements     interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly form the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
