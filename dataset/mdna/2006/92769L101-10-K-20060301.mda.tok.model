factors affecting our business our residential customers account for the majority of our total revenue 
the number of customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to customers 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than atv 
our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services like dual telephone and broadband 
factors affecting our profitability include customer churn  average revenue per user  or arpu  and competition 
summary statistics selected statistics for residential customers including customers off our network and virgin 
net customers for the three months ended december  as well as the four prior quarters are set forth in the table below 
for the three months ended december  september  june  march  december  opening customers     data cleanse   adjusted opening customers     customer additions      customer disconnects     net customer movement      reduction in customer count   closing customers     churn revenue generating units television      dtv      telephone      broadband      total revenue generating units    rgu customers x x x x x internet dial up and dtv access     average revenue per user data cleanse activity  as part of the harmonization of billing systems  resulted in a decrease in the number of recorded customers by approximately  in the three months ended december  further data cleanse in the three months ended december  resulted in a decrease of  customers 
we removed approximately  customers  representing approximately  rgus from the customer count in the three months ended december  following implementation of a new credit policy and the resulting disconnection of inactive backlog customers 
further review in the three months ended december   resulted in an adjustment to remove an additional  customers  representing approximately  rgus 
customer churn is calculated by taking the total disconnects during the month and dividing them by the average number of customers during the month 
average monthly churn during a quarter is the average of the three monthly churn calculations within the quarter 
each telephone  television and broadband internet subscriber directly connected to our network counts as one rgu 
accordingly  a subscriber who receives both telephone and television service counts as two rgus 
rgus may include subscribers receiving some services for free or at a reduced rate in connection with incentive offers 
dial up internet customers exclude metered customers who have not used the service within the last days and include virgin 
net customers 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is calculated on a monthly basis by dividing total revenue generated from the provision of telephone  cable television and internet services to customers who are directly connected to our network in that month  exclusive of vat  by the average number of customers directly connected to our network in that month 
quarterly arpu is the average of the three months in that quarter 
customer churn 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop using our services 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in an effort to manage our customer churn rate 
although our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season  managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
our customer churn rate may increase if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption or if we fail to match offerings by our competitors 
arpu 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from customers 
we believe that our triple play offering of telephone service  broadband access to the internet and dtv will prove attractive to our existing customer base and allow us to increase our arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets  including through other broadband service providers  telephone services offered by bt  alternative internet access services like dsl  which is offered by bt  digital satellite television services offered by bskyb and digital terrestrial television offered by freeview 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations  and if required  drawdowns under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements in the merger transaction with telewest will be financed with a new stock issuance  cash on hand and new financings 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because all of our revenue and substantially all of our operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the us dollar or the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar debt or euro debt will be higher 
as of december   million  or of our long term debt  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our long term debt was denominated in euros 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
seasonality 
some revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by customers and businesses tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodations between school years 
integration of billing systems 
our historical growth through acquisitions resulted in us inheriting numerous billing systems  which had many differences in functionality  resulting in inefficiencies in our customer service processes 
as a result of our billing system integration program  we have consolidated the number of billing systems for our residential customers from eleven at the beginning of to three currently 
we continue to evaluate how many billing systems we will utilize for residential and business customers  taking into account the prospects for improved efficiencies and better customer service as well as the potential for disruption in the business from additional migration of data 
accordingly  the timing and extent of further integration efforts remain under review and are likely to be influenced by completion of the merger with telewest 
call center consolidation 
on april   we announced the consolidation over the next months of our uk customer service call centers into three equipped to handle anticipated expansion of our customer base 
following an internal review  three specialist call centers have been retained and developed and are supported by four sales and customer support sites  located throughout the uk the call center consolidation was completed as of december  at a cost of million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  income tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with acquisitions  and certain financing transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the united kingdom and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to matters such as business acquisitions and disposals and certain financing transactions including intercompany transactions  amongst others  and we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment may be probable and the amount is estimable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of revisions to these estimates are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes have and will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and our tax environment changes 
fixed assets fixed assets  net  totaled  million and  million  representing and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
in accordance with sop  upon our emergence from chapter reorganization  we adopted fresh start reporting as of january  pursuant to fresh start reporting  the carrying values of our fixed assets were adjusted to their reorganization values  which were equivalent to their estimated fair values 
these adjusted carrying values became the revised cost basis of our fixed assets at january  fixed assets  net were written down by  million to  million to reflect this adjustment 
fixed assets acquired since january   are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our managers use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
revenue we recognize revenue only when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and our customers  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price for the service is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle  and is recognized as the services are provided 
at the end of each period  adjustments are recorded to defer revenue relating to services billed in advance and to accrue for earned but unbilled services 
telephone  cable television and internet revenues are recognized as the services are provided to customers 
bundled services revenue is recognized at the time the services are provided to the customer or the performance of all of the services have been completed 
the company applies the provisions of eitf no  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to assess whether the components of the bundled services should be recognized separately 
installation revenue is recognized by applying the provisions of fasb statement no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies in relation to connection and activation fees for cable television  as well as telephone and internet services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
installation revenue is recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that such revenue is less than direct selling costs 
installation revenue in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
rental revenue in respect of line rentals and rental of equipment provided to customers is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement 
trade receivables our trade receivables are stated at outstanding principal balances  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and other receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make payments 
these allowances are estimated based on the current aging of receivables  prior collection experience and future expectations of conditions that might impact recoverability 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additions to the allowances may be required 
pensions we account for our defined benefit pension plans using fasb statement no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  or fas  and the disclosure rules under the revised fasb statement no 
revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements  and under fas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under fas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we expect our pension expense to be approximately million in the calculation of pension expense and our pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
when calculating pension expense for  we assumed that our plans assets would generate a long term rate of approximately 
this rate is lower than the rates of between and used to calculate the expense 
we develop our expected long term rate of return assumption based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plan s assets  including the trustee s review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we discounted our future pension obligations using a rate of at december   and rates of between and at december  we determine the appropriate discount rate based on the current rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by would increase our pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  we recognize derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated and considered to be effective as a cash flow hedge of an exposure to future changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  the change in fair value of the instrument is deferred in other comprehensive income 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement to match the corresponding cash flows on the underlying hedged transaction 
changes in fair value of any instrument not designated as a hedge or considered to be ineffective as a hedge are reported in earnings immediately 
restructuring costs as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas  and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
prior to  we recognized a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities at the time a commitment to restructure was given  in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  continue to be accounted for under eitf in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given to sublessees  and amounts of lease termination costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations  fsp 
the fasb issued the fsp to address the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive adopted by the european union eu 
fsp requires that the commercial user should apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
and the related fasb interpretation no 
to certain obligations associated with historical waste as defined by the directive  since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation 
the fsp is effective for the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member country 
as at december   the uk had not adopted the law 
we intend to evaluate the impact of this law on the company s results of operations or financial position as and when legislation is adopted in the uk 
consolidated results of operations from continuing operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   consolidated revenue decreased by to  million from  million for our revenue by customer type for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions increase decrease revenues consumer   business total revenues   consumer for the year ended december   revenue from residential customers increased by to  million from  million during the same period in this increase is driven largely by growth in the number of broadband internet subscribers as well as the inclusion of additional revenue of million from our subsidiary virgin net limited following its acquisition in november these increases have been offset by lower telephony usage revenue as a result of a decline in the volume of minutes generated per customer and competitive pressure on pricing and higher promotional discounts as well as lower tv revenue due to lower atv subscribers and lower premium channel revenue 
business for the year ended december   revenue from business customers decreased by to million from million during the same period in this decrease reflects the loss of million of wholesale revenue from virgin net limited  which ceased to be a third party business customer as a consequence of its acquisition by us in november  together with the conclusion of two wholesale customer contracts 
lower telephony access and usage revenues have been offset by growth in install  data product and project revenue 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  decreased by to million from million during the same period in operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to for the year ended december   from for the same period in primarily because of a reduction in telephony interconnect costs driven by lower usage on low margin call types and lower television content costs offset by the impact of more installs in pre wired homes where the cost to install is expensed and an increase in costs associated with network repair and maintenance

in addition  we have experienced lower telephony usage revenue per customer because of increased competition in the business telecommunications market  together with a move towards the use of mobile telephones rather than fixed lines 
this decrease has been partly mitigated by higher revenue from wholesale call termination and higher revenue from wholesale internet access solutions provided to isps

income tax expense for the year ended december   income tax expense was million as compared with income tax expense of million for the same period in the and expense is composed of in millions us state and local income tax deferred us income tax alternative minimum tax deferred non us income tax non us current tax total in  we paid million of the alternative minimum tax and million of us state and local tax expense for none of the remaining income tax expense is expected to be payable in the next year 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   loss from continuing operations was million compared with a loss of million for the same period in the reduction in loss from continuing operations is attributable to our improved operating performance and savings in interest expense partly offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss from continuing operations per share basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was and for the year ended december  was 
basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per share is computed using an average of million shares issued in the year ended december  and an average of million shares issued for the same period in options to purchase million shares and million shares of restricted stock at december  are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss from continuing operations per share  since the inclusion of such options and shares is anti dilutive 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive  we are highly leveraged  and we have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flow  partly as a result of our construction costs  operating expenditures and interest costs 
we require significant amounts of capital to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network and offer new services 
we must also regularly service interest payments with cash flows from operations 
our ability to sustain operations  meet financial covenants under our indebtedness  and make required payments on our indebtedness could be impaired if we are unable to maintain or achieve various financial performance measures 
our ability to service our capital needs  to service our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund our ongoing operations will depend upon our ability to generate cash 
for the year ended december   our cash increased by million and this was principally because of the proceeds from the sale of our broadcast and irish operations partly offset by debt repayments and stock purchases 
although we expect to generate positive cash flow in the future  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and  if required  drawdowns under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through at least march  however  our cash requirements after march  may exceed these sources of cash 
this may require that we obtain additional financing in excess of the financing incurred in the refinancing transaction 
we may not be able to obtain financing at all  or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of the senior notes or our senior credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness 
we are a holding company with no independent operations or significant assets other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
in addition  the terms of our and our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which those subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions to us under many circumstances 
our debt agreements and the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements 
at december   all of our defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations exceeding plan assets totaling million 
we need to fund these deficits in accordance with the laws and regulations of the uk  and our contribution levels are currently undergoing review 
we expect to contribute a total of million in but our pension contributions are subject to change based on the findings of this review 
description of outstanding indebtedness the terms of the significant notes and credit facilities issued by our subsidiaries as at december  are summarized below 
senior credit facility the principal amount outstanding is  million 
our senior credit facility comprises a term facility denominated in a combination of pounds sterling  euros and us dollars totaling  million and a revolving facility of million 
the term facility was fully drawn and million of the revolving facility was used for guarantees at december  our senior credit facility bears interest at libor plus mandatory costs plus a margin rate 
the term facility and the revolving facility have different margin rates 
at december   the effective average annual interest rate on the term facility was 
interest is payable at least semi annually 
the principal amount outstanding under the term facility is repayable by semi annual installments beginning september the voluntary prepayments of million  million and million made on february   june  and july   respectively  reduced the scheduled repayments thereafter 
the senior credit facility is secured over most of our assets 
we are subject to financial maintenance tests under our senior credit facility  including a test of liquidity  coverage and leverage ratios applied to us and some of our subsidiaries 
as at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
senior notes senior notes due april  the principal amount at maturity is million 
interest is payable semi annually on april and october commencing october  senior notes due april  the principal amount at maturity is million 
interest is payable semi annually on april and october commencing october  senior notes due april  the principal amount at maturity is million 
interest is payable semi annually on april and october commencing october  floating rate senior notes due october  on july   we redeemed the million floating rate senior notes in full 
the agreements governing our indebtedness significantly and  in some cases  absolutely restrict our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  or redeem or repurchase equity interests or subordinated obligations  make investments  sell assets  including the capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  enter into agreements that restrict the restricted subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  transfer assets or make intercompany loans  merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in connection with the merger with telewest  the above indebtedness will be refinanced 
see combination with telewest senior credit facility and bridge facility 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we had no off balance sheet transactions 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in the refinancing transaction  we incurred obligations in a combination of us dollars  euros and pounds sterling at fixed and variable interest rates 
as a result we are exposed to variability in our cash flows and earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we have entered into a number of derivative instruments with a number of counter parties to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
on october   we entered into an agreement with several financial institutions for new credit facilities in connection with the combination transaction with telewest 
as a result of this  we have discontinued the hedge designation of certain of our hedges 
we are subject to currency exchange rate risks  because substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar and the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar and euro denominated debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december   million  or of our long term debt  was denominated in us dollars and million  or of our long term debt  was denominated in euros 
we are also subject to interest rate risk because we have substantial indebtedness at variable interest rates 
as of december   interest is determined on a variable basis on  million  or  of our long term debt 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our interest expense by approximately million per year 
interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future interest payments on our senior credit facility  which accrues interest at variable rates based on libor 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive interest based on libor in exchange for payments of interest at fixed rates of and 
the net settlement of million under these interest rate swaps is included within interest expense for the year ended december  we have designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in libor 
the interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
on september   we discontinued hedge designation on certain instruments that hedged interest payments on credit facilities that will be refinanced subsequent to that date 
changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in gains on derivative instruments in the statement of operations 
cross currency interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in the pound sterling value of interest payments on the senior notes due  interest payments on the us dollar denominated senior credit facility and the pound sterling value of interest payments on the euro denominated senior credit facility 
under the cross currency interest rate swaps we receive interest in us dollars at a rate of  and us dollars and euros at a variable rate based on libor  and we pay interest in pound sterling at a rate of  and at a variable rate based on libor 
the net settlement of million under the cross currency interest rate swap is included within interest expense for the year ended december  we have designated the cross currency interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in the pound sterling value of the interest payments on the senior notes and senior credit facility that result from changes in the us dollar  pound sterling and euro exchange rates 
the cross currency interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency forward contracts we have entered into a number of forward contracts maturing on april  to purchase a total of million and million 
the contracts hedge the variability in the pound sterling value of the principal obligation of the senior notes and on the senior credit facility based on a variable rate of libor  resulting from changes in the us dollar  pound sterling and euro exchange rates 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward rate contracts to purchase the us dollar equivalent of billion  maturing in april these contracts hedge changes in the pound sterling value of the borrowed position of the cash purchase price of telewest 
the forward contracts are not effective as hedges under fas the forward contracts are still recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value but changes in the fair value are reported in the income statement 
however  the forward contracts do not subject us to material volatility in our earnings and cash flows because changes in the fair value directionally and partially mitigate the gains or losses on the translation of the us dollar and euro denominated senior notes and senior credit facility into pounds sterling

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  all of our revenues and a substantial portion of our operating costs are earned and paid in pound sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
as of december   million  or of our long term debt  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our long term debt was denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
