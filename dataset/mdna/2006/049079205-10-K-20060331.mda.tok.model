item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide wireless and wireline telecommunications services in the caribbean and north america through the following operating subsidiaries and affiliate guyana telephone telegraph company  ltd 
or gt t is the national and international telephone company in the republic of guyana and the largest wireless service provider in that country 
we acquired an equity interest in gt t in commnet wireless  llc is an owner and operator of wholesale wireless networks in rural areas of the united states 
commnet provides wireless voice and data communications roaming services to national  regional and local wireless carriers 
we acquired a interest in commnet in september sovernet  inc is a facilities based integrated voice  broadband data communications and dial up services provider in new england  primarily in vermont 
we acquired a equity interest in sovernet in february bermuda digital communications  ltd 
or bdc is the largest wireless voice and data communications service provider in bermuda  doing business under the name cellular one 
we acquired a equity interest in  and signed a management contract with  bdc in choice communications  llc is a leading provider of fixed wireless broadband data services and dial up internet services to retail and business customers in the us virgin islands 
choice also provides fixed wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands 
choice acquired its internet service business in and its television business in march we acquired choice in october as a holding company  atlantic tele network provides management  technical  financial  regulatory  and marketing services to  and generally receives a management fee equal to approximately of revenues from each operating subsidiary and our bdc affiliate 
because we do not control bdc  we account for our investment in that entity under the equity method 
earnings from bdc do not appear in our income from operations  but are instead reflected in equity earnings of unconsolidated investments  net of tax in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in july  bdc has the option to repurchase from us all  but not less than all  of our equity interest in bdc at a price equal to fair market value 
also in  our management fee arrangement with bdc will expire 
the following chart summarizes the operating activities of our subsidiaries and our bdc affiliate and the markets they serve as of december  services operating subsidiary affiliate markets wireless commnet united states rural markets gt t guyana bdc bermuda local telephone and data gt t guyana sovernet united states new england choice internet access us virgin islands international long distance gt t guyana other choice digital television us virgin islands for information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and long lived assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue and operating income from gt t 
for fiscal years  and  gt t generated  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue and a substantial majority of our profits 
gt t provides domestic wireline telephone service and international long distance service pursuant to an exclusive license from the government of guyana and provides wireless service on a non exclusive basis 
the rates that gt t may charge for its services are regulated by the public utility commission of guyana or puc  an independent regulatory body responsible for regulating telecommunications 
the puc also has powers to assess gt t s compliance with the terms of gt t s exclusive license 
under that license  gt t is entitled to charge rates that will enable it to earn an annual minimum rate of return on capital equal to of gt t s capital dedicated to public use 
see business regulation of our gt t subsidiary 
historically  the largest component of gt t s contribution to our consolidated revenue has been from its international long distance business  which in fiscal years  and accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our income 
most of these revenues and profits were from payments by foreign carriers for handling international long distance calls originating from the foreign carriers country and terminating in guyana 
these payments are denominated in us dollars 
gt t s incoming international long distance business is driven by the population of guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to guyana  the rate foreign carriers pay gt t for handling the incoming international calls  and the number of people in guyana capable of receiving international long distance calls  which consists of wireline telephone customers and all of the wireless subscribers in guyana including subscribers of other wireless service providers 
the rates at which gt t collects fees from foreign carriers are established by agreements between it and foreign carriers  and can be affected by limits set by foreign telecommunications regulators  especially the federal communications commission or fcc  regarding how much carriers under their jurisdiction may pay for the termination of an international long distance call in another country 
regulatory developments challenging or limiting our exclusive wireline license in guyana and any future orders by the fcc limiting the rates foreign carriers may pay gt t for international long distance calls terminating in guyana are the principal known risks of this business 
since  the government of guyana has stated its intention to introduce competition into guyana s telecommunications sector 
we believe that the introduction of wireline based competition would require the termination of the exclusivity provisions of gt t s wireline license  and thus would require appropriate compensation to gt t and a rebalancing of telephone rates so that those rates reflect the actual cost of providing such services 
we also believe that the government of guyana is considering shifting from rate of return regulation to incentive rate cap regulation 
gt t has not had formal discussions with government officials regarding these matters since the second quarter of see business regulation of our gt t subsidiary 
in january  the fcc reduced the payment rate for us guyana traffic from per minute to per minute which negatively impacted gt t s operating profits 
the lowering of the us international settlement rate in has been followed by a gradual reduction in settlement rates between guyana and most other countries to per minute or less 
the reduction in the settlement rate resulted in a substantial reduction in inbound international telecommunication revenue 
in  and again in  at t proposed further reductions in the settlement rate benchmarks for many countries  including guyana  and requested that the fcc initiate a rule making to consider the issue 
while the fcc rejected at t s request in early  it indicated that it will continue to monitor and evaluate settlement rate benchmarks 
in the future  we expect the percentage of our revenues and operating income contributed by businesses other than gt t s wireline services to increase 
we have experienced significant growth in gt t s wireless business in recent years 
as of december   we had approximately  wireless subscribers  up from the approximately  subscribers we had at december  a significant challenge for us is satisfying the strong demand for our wireless service  especially since our deployment of gsm service  while maintaining quality of service 
this challenge has been made more difficult by a new spectrum reallocation plan that has reduced our available capacity to serve our customers 
we are addressing this matter by seeking additional capacity from the government of guyana and adding additional cell sites and equipment to our network 
another significant challenge for gt t wireless is increased competition from new wireless service providers 
guyana government officials  including the president  have stated that guyana will provide a wireless license to a large mobile telecommunications company operating in many caribbean countries 
we also expect our recent acquisitions of commnet and sovernet in september and february  respectively  to affect the relative contributions of our businesses 
for the fiscal quarter ended december   commnet generated million in wireless revenue and was accretive to net income for the quarter and fiscal year on a pro forma basis assuming we acquired commnet on january   our consolidated revenue would have been million and our consolidated net income would have been million for fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we encourage you to read our critical accounting policies which are important for understanding our financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  see critical accounting policies 
results of operations years ended december  and amount of percent year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease in thousands revenue wireless local telephone and data international long distance other total revenue operating expenses termination and access fees internet and programming engineering and operations sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes  minority interests and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income taxes income before minority interests and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates minority interests  net of tax equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net of tax net income wireless revenue 
wireless revenue represents the wholesale voice and data roaming revenue of commnet  which was acquired on september   as well as gt t s wireless revenues  including airtime and activation fees 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
of the million increase  commnet contributed million of wireless revenue since its acquisition 
on a pro forma basis assuming we acquired commnet on january   our wireless revenue would have been million for fiscal year the remaining increase of million was attributable to the continued growth of our cellular subscriber base in guyana as the number of our subscribers increased from  to  as of december  and  respectively 
as noted in prior periods  management believes that some portion of this subscriber growth is a result of some new gsm customers retaining their old tdma handsets and accounts for the time being 
nonetheless  we believe that the strong growth of gsm subscribers in guyana is quite significant in the face of a new nationwide gsm competitor as approximately  of our wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  we expect that wireless revenue will continue to increase in as both commnet and gt t continue their network expansions  although we will need to manage gt t s gsm subscriber growth carefully because of recent quality problems related to network congestion 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue largely represents the basic service fees  measured service revenue  internet access fees and other revenues generated by our fixed wireline network in guyana  such as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue also includes internet access fees generated by our data network in the us virgin islands and  in future periods  will include local telephone and data revenue generated by sovernet in vermont 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in local revenue at gt t resulting from increased local calling volume 
local revenue was also positively impacted by increases in choice s wireless broadband subscribers offset  in part  by the attrition of dial up subscribers 
in future periods  apart from the expected impact of sovernet s revenue  we anticipate that local telephone and data revenue will increase as a result of network and subscriber growth in guyana and the us virgin islands 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is primarily generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana 
inbound traffic  which makes up more than of this revenue  is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue decreased by million  or  from million in to million in however  revenue for included a previously disclosed million settlement of amounts paid to us by a large international carrier that were significantly past due and written off in a prior period 
net of this settlement  international long distance revenue remained relatively unchanged from to the lack of growth of this revenue was unexpected given the expansion of our wireless subscribers and our access lines in guyana 
we would have expected international long distance revenue to increase with more handsets and access lines in service 
our wireless subscribers  largely pre paid  increased by more than as discussed above  and gt t s access lines increased by about from  to  as december  and  respectively  as we continued our efforts to bring new areas of guyana into service 
one of the reasons for the lack of international long distance revenue  we believe  is the growth in unauthorized internet calling 
while this mainly impacts outbound calls  forms of bypass ie  international calls that are routed around our international exchange through technologies such as voip using internet calling and other mechanisms may be increasing 
if we are effective in combating illegal bypass  we would expect our international long distance traffic to continue to grow modestly as a result of continued expansion of the guyana subscriber base 
however  the increase in this traffic may not result in an increase in revenue if it is offset  or exceeded  by further declines in the average rate per minute 
despite the lack of growth in this category  the contribution of international long distance to our operating profits actually grew because of a greater percentage decline in long distance expenses  as discussed below 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from choice s digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in television services was a result of an increase in television subscribers from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   including additional hotel rooms 
in the near term  we expect this category of revenue will largely be driven by our television revenue and therefore we expect it to continue to increase during the next few quarters  although potentially at a slower rate  provided we are able to continue our subscriber gains 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay to international carriers to terminate our outbound telephone traffic as well as for certain circuit and bandwidth costs 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to net of commnet s expenses of million for a portion of  our termination and access fees decreased by million from to because of lower long distance expenses in guyana 
the addition of commnet and sovernet is expected to increase these expenses substantially in future periods 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include digital television programming costs as well as internet connectivity charges 
internet and programming expenses increased from million to million  primarily because of the growth in our television and broadband internet subscribers at choice 
we expect that increased internet and backhaul capacity requirements at choice as well as the addition of sovernet will increase our internet and programming expenses in future periods 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks including the salaries and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to this increase is the result of the increase in costs to support our expanding networks and subscriber bases 
a higher per unit cost of fuel and power in guyana also contributed to this increase as did the addition of commnet 
we expect engineering and operations to continue to increase in order to support our expanding networks 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses include expenses relating to the salaries and benefits that we pay for sales personnel and the expenses associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns  as well as customer service expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the result of additional costs needed to provide customer service to our increased subscriber bases as well as more aggressive marketing and sales initiatives in guyana in connection with competition for gsm market share 
both we and our main competitor launched gsm services in guyana in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expenses are expected to fluctuate somewhat in the future depending on the competitive environment and the timing of the launch of new services  but in the near term we expect this to increase due to the addition of sovernet and increased wireless competition in guyana 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of commnet which added million of overhead expenses during without commnet  our general and administrative expenses decreased by million which is primarily attributable to the discontinuance of the operations of atlantic tele network or atc and call home telecom during we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods for a number of reasons  including the impact of a full year of commnet  the addition of sovernet  growth in our holding company s staff and compensation  and growth in some of our operating units because of growth in the size of their networks and customer bases  although we expect to reap some modest efficiencies in integrating our newest operating units 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation charges we record on our property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is due to the expansion of our networks  primarily in guyana  to support increased subscriber bases 
a portion of the increase reflects the addition of commnet s assets on september  outside of the acquisition of commnet  we expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase in the near term  because of continued growth in our networks 
however  this increase may be offset in part by certain equipment becoming fully depreciated in future periods and potentially declining capital expenditures in certain markets 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net represents interest income on our cash balances  net of the interest expense on our outstanding debt including a million term loan as well as the outstanding amounts under our million revolving line of credit facility 
interest income expense  net decreased from income of million from an expense of million  a reduction of million 
this decrease is primarily the result of increased expense from the borrowings used to complete the acquisition of commnet on september   as well as the use of some of our cash on hand 
other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income earned by  or expenses incurred by  us including management fees received from our unconsolidated affiliates  mainly bdc 
other income expense decreased from an expense of million for to an expense of million for while management fees from bdc remained relatively unchanged at million for both and  both years were impacted by substantial one time gains or impairments 
the fiscal year includes foreign exchange gains of million offset by a write down of the goodwill of choice of million  an impairment of atc s assets of million  an impairment of call home telecom s assets of million and a write off for secured loans made in connection with our investment in lightrade  inc of million for for  other income expense includes a reserve for our advances to bridge international communications  inc of million offset by miscellaneous income of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a reserve of million against the amounts due from bridge as bridge has had difficulty closing contracts for its primary business line of managed network services 
income taxes 
income taxes represent taxes we pay on our net taxable income 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes and the amortization of a deferred tax asset which was recorded in a prior period 
our high effective tax rate for these periods reflects the fact that our losses at choice and some of the curtailed businesses were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
the addition of commnet and sovernet should lower our effective tax rate in future periods  particularly if accompanied by any reduction in our losses at choice 
minority interests 
minority interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in commnet and other minority shareholder s interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the earnings of bdc  our cellular affiliate in bermuda  as well as our share of the earnings of commnet s unconsolidated investments 
as previously announced  in the first quarter of  commnet acquired the remaining of the equity in its largest unconsolidated investment  a missouri cellular network  which will reduce the earnings or losses that would have been reported in this category 
equity in the earnings of bdc increased from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects increased roaming and long distance revenues partially stemming from an increase of  subscribers  or  from  as of december  to  at december  the increased subscriber levels include new data customers using our new ev do network to obtain high speed mobile data services 
bdc s ability to continue earnings growth in will be hampered due to the delay in its hearing on the scope of its data license and the possibility of an intensified competitive environment 
for  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates also includes million of earnings from commnet s unconsolidated affiliates 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per basic and diluted share  as compared to million  or per basic and diluted share for the increase of million or was attributable to the net income of commnet since its acquisition on september   partially offset by a reserve against the amounts due from bridge 
years ended december  and year ended december  amount of percent increase increase decrease decrease in thousands revenue wireless local telephone and data international long distance other total revenue operating expenses termination and access fees internet and programming engineering and operations sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes  minority interests and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate income taxes income before minority interests and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate minority interests  net of tax equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate  net of tax net income wireless revenue 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was attributable to the increase in our wireless subscribers in guyana from  to  as of december  and  respectively  although it was offset in part by the decline in the value of the guyana dollar in a significant part of the increase was driven by the launch of gsm services in guyana in the fourth quarter of local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data decreased slightly from million for to million for  a decrease of million or 
while our access lines in guyana grew from  as of december  to  as of december   our local revenue was also negatively impacted because the decline in the value of the guyana dollar in exceeded the growth in revenue in the local currency 
this item was also negatively impacted by a decline in dial up internet service revenues from the us virgin islands 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue increased by million from million to million from to  respectively 
however  revenues for included a previously disclosed million settlement of amounts owed to us by a large international carrier that were significantly past due and written off in a prior period 
net of this settlement  international long distance revenue increased by million  or  to million 
in management s opinion  the increase was largely attributable to the increase in access lines and wireless subscribers in guyana  which provides more people with the means to make or receive an international call and thus tends to increase internet traffic  which rose from million minutes for to million minutes for other revenue 
other revenue increased by million  or  from million to million as choice s digital television subscribers increased from  to  from to  respectively 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses decreased by million  or  from million to million from to gt t was able to reduce its long distance expenses by executing more efficient routing of outbound traffic lowering average outbound termination rates 
in addition  we had lower circuit costs in the us virgin islands resulting from the decline of our dial up internet subscriber base 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses increased from million to million as our digital television subscribers increased  as previously noted 
in addition  the increase in internet and programming expenses is attributable to the increase in choice s wireless broadband subscribers offset by a decrease in its dial up customers 
engineering and operations expenses 
our engineering and operations expenses as a whole remained relatively unchanged from to while our operating costs increased year over year in order to support our growing network  we realized the benefit of a decline in the guyana dollar at our gt t subsidiary 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  from million to million from to sales and marketing remained relatively unchanged year over year as the increase in our marketing expenses relating to the launch of gt t s gsm service during late was offset by the decline in the guyana dollar as compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged from year to year despite an increase in our networks and customer bases due to the positive effect in of the guyana currency decline and the settlement of a lawsuit 
however professional fees  primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of increased in depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase reflects the expansion of our networks in recent years  particularly the growth of our wireless network in guyana  but the increase also reflects the rising level of network and customer premise equipment servicing our television and broadband customers in the us virgin islands 
interest expense income 
interest expense income increased by million from to million as a result of a reduction in borrowings under our credit facilities and an increased focus on maximizing the return on our cash balances 
other income expense other income decreased from income of million to an expense of million for and  respectively  as a result of the impairment of certain assets at choice and our now curtailed atc subsidiary during income taxes 
our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes and the amortization of a deferred tax asset which was recorded in a prior period 
the increase in the rate was largely due to the recording of approximately million in non cash charges related to the write down of assets for which there was no associated tax benefit 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate 
our equity in the earnings of bdc increased from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects increased roaming and long distance revenues and an increase of  subscribers  or  from  as of december  to  at december  in addition to the overall growth in our subscriber base and therefore revenue from our customers roaming in other markets  the growth in roaming and long distance revenue at bdc stems from the establishment of roaming relationships with the two largest us cdma carriers whose customers for the most part can roam only on our network when in bermuda in late and early net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share basic and diluted share  as compared to million  or per basic share and per diluted share for  a decrease of million or 
our net income for was reduced by several significant impairment and other charges totaling approximately million that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of the impact of these charges was partly offset by some large carrier settlements we recognized on a cash basis and a foreign exchange gain  which together increased net income by approximately million 
in addition to the foreign exchange gain stemming from the revaluation of our guyana dollar assets and liabilities  the decline in the value of the guyana dollar in also reduced the us dollar value of our non international revenue in guyana while at the same time reducing the us dollar value of many guyana expenses  offset by some price inflation in local currency terms 
regulatory and tax issues we are involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have met our operational liquidity needs through a combination of cash on hand and internally generated funds and have funded capital expenditures and acquisitions with a combination of internally generated funds  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
uses of cash capital expenditures 
a significant use of our cash has been on capital expenditures expanding our networks 
in  we spent approximately million for additional capital expenditures 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in guyanese telecommunications infrastructure 
we anticipate capital expenditures for existing businesses to be approximately million to million during fiscal to  among other things  expand commnet s wireless network primarily additional gsm and cdma base stations  increase gt t s wireless capacity and coverage primarily new sites and base stations  expand gt t s wireline network primarily additional switches and cabling and to a lesser extent  additional switch based service capabilities and expand service areas at sovernet and expand service areas and fund upgrades at choice 
acquisitions 
we have funded our recent acquisitions with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our million credit facility  which was established in september in connection with our acquisition of commnet 
on september   we acquired a equity interest in commnet for approximately million in cash  using borrowings of approximately million under the credit facility and approximately million of cash on hand 
for a discussion of our acquisitions occurring subsequent to december   see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
from time to time we explore opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean  the united states and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares  payment of cash or incurrence of debt 
dividends and distributions 
we use cash to make quarterly dividends payments to our common stockholders when declared by our board of directors 
in  our quarterly dividends to our stockholders aggregated million 
we have paid quarterly dividends for the last fiscal quarters 
in addition  we are obligated to make dividend payments to the minority shareholders of certain subsidiaries  and paid dividends of million in also our board of directors approved a million stock buyback plan in september pursuant to which we have spent to date  repurchasing common stock 
although we currently do not intend to make additional repurchases of common stock under this plan  we may act to do so in the future  depending on market conditions and our cash management needs 
debt service and other contractual commitment table 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our debt and lease obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt including interest operating lease obligations total we are also obligated under the commnet merger agreement to purchase in july an additional interest in commnet of florida  llc for million 
sources of cash we are a holding company  and our cash flows are derived solely from distributions from and the management fees paid to us by our operating subsidiaries 
historically  gt t has been the most significant of our operating subsidiaries in terms of our liquidity 
none of our subsidiaries are subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
total liquidity at december  as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
this represents a decrease of million compared to december  we believe our existing cash balances and other capital resources  including the remaining amounts available under the million revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility  are adequate to meet our current operating and capital needs 
as of march   we had approximately million available under our credit facility 
cash generated by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in see cash flow summary 
new credit facility 
on september   atlantic tele network entered into a credit agreement with cobank  acb providing for a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
under the term loan  repayments of principal are deferred until the maturity of the loan on october  interest on the term loan is payable on a quarterly basis at a fixed annual interest rate of 
because cobank is a cooperative financial institution  we expect to receive payments annually  and at the end of the term  from cobank which reflect our portion of cobank s profits  if any  and these payments are expected to reduce our effective interest expense on the term loan 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to at our option i libor plus a margin ranging from to or ii a variable rate of interest as defined in the revolving credit facility plus 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our commnet subsidiary  and is collateralized by  among other things  a security interest in substantially all the assets of  and stock owned by  atlantic tele network and commnet 
as of march   we had approximately million of borrowings under the credit facility and million of other long term debt 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are demand for our services  competition  regulatory developments  economic conditions in the markets where we operate our businesses and industry trends within the telecommunications industry

guyana us foreign currency exchange 
historically  the guyana dollar has been considerably devalued relative to the us dollar 
the current exchange rate is approximately guyana dollars to us dollar 
we use us dollars to make gt t capital expenditures  to pay certain gt t liabilities including a portion of gt t s tax liability to guyana and to value our gt t assets for the purpose of making our guyanese rate of return calculation 
unfavorable changes in the guyana dollar us dollar exchange rate would reduce our purchasing power in these areas 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
while currently a significant portion of gt t s revenues are transacted in us dollars  this circumstance could change in the future 
as a result of the rate increases previously awarded to  and currently sought by  gt t  the growth of gt t s local exchange operations and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of our revenues will be earned in guyanese currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the our conversion of guyanese currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyanese currency or foreign currency from guyana  there are risks associated with the conversion of guyanese dollars to us dollars due to limited liquidity in the guyana foreign currency markets 
this limited liquidity has not prevented us from converting guyanese currency into us dollars within a given three month period or from converting at a price that reasonably approximates the reported exchange rate 
while we believe that gt t has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in hard currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into the hard currency needed to meet such obligations 
as of december   we had no cash held in guyanese dollars 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
restrictions under credit facility 
our credit facility contains four financial tests with which atlantic tele network must comply a total leverage ratio debt to ebitda of to or less  a debt service coverage ratio ebitda to debt service of to or more  and an equity to assets ratio of to or more 
in addition  commnet must comply with a leverage ratio test debt of atlantic tele network and its subsidiaries  net of pledged cash  to ebitda of commnet and its subsidiaries of to  which will decrease over time to to at july  as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the wireless industry  our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 
cash flow summary cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in towards the end of and continuing into early  we invested a portion of our cash balances into highly rated debt instruments 
investments in these items will generally be recorded as marketable securities on our balance sheet 
while we believe this is a prudent way to increase returns on our cash  these investments carry more risk to principal than bank money market accounts due to the possibility of adverse market changes or negative developments involving the issuer of any such instruments 
we try to minimize these risks by generally seeking instruments with shorter maturities issued by highly rated government agencies or corporations  but there is no way to eliminate the risk to principal 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the years through critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we periodically evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to foreign currency  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  tax related accruals and contingencies 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
foreign currency 
from the inception of gt t s operations through december   a significant portion of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures  including a substantial majority of its capital expenditures  have been in us dollars or other hard currencies 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency and any transaction gains and losses on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are reflected in income 
late in and early  the value of the guyana dollar declined in relation to the us dollar  resulting in foreign exchange gains 
while the decline in rates did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating expenses  the decline has offset growth in gt t s wireless local exchange and outbound international long distance revenues  which are billed and paid in guyana dollars 
further declines in the value of the guyana dollar may have an adverse impact on our future operating results as growth of local currency denominated revenue continues 
as of december   none of our million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents was in guyana dollars 
with the decline in international settlement rates  the expansion of gt t s wireless business and the increases that gt t has received and hopes to receive in its rates for local service  it is possible that the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future 
revenue recognition 
all of our revenues are recognized when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular carrier or customer transaction  we apply the criteria established by staff of accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria and rely on our past history of disputes and collections with carriers and customers in estimating amounts for which revenue is not recognized 
however  due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
our wireless revenue is generated by both our commnet and gt t subsidiaries 
gt t charges an activation fee to new cellular subscribers in guyana and re activation fees to subscribers in guyana who allow their accounts to lapse 
we have determined that the activation fees do not represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf accordingly  our policy is to defer those fees and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period in accordance with sab to date  those fees have been immaterial to both gt t s and our consolidated financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
commnet does not charge for activation or installation fees  and derives substantially all of its wireless revenue from a per minute charge which is recognized as revenue as earned 
local telephone and data revenue for the periods presented  as well as other revenue  is generated by our gt t and choice subsidiaries 
for gt t  installation fees do not represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf accordingly  our policy is to defer those fees and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period in accordance with sab to date  those fees have been immaterial to both gt t s and our consolidated financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
for choice  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to choice s data  television and other services monthly  as the services are provided 
installation fees charged by choice communications to customers subscribing to cable and internet services have also historically been immaterial to both choice s and our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the installation fee is intended to recover a portion of the costs associated with the installation of cabling and related equipment at the customer location required for that customer to receive choice s monthly service offerings 
we determined that the activation fees represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf as such  our policy is to recognize these fees as revenue when the services are performed 
for our international long distance revenue  we determine the country of origin of the traffic which we receive from foreign carriers in order to apply the appropriate rate to the minutes of long distance traffic 
gt t operates in a regulated industry  therefore its pricing is subject to regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount it bills customers in current and future periods 
valuation of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue and the corresponding receivable can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
however  the amounts we will ultimately realize upon settlement could differ in the near term from the amounts assumed in estimating these revenues and the related accounts receivable 
property  plant and equipment 
we operate in an environment where rapid changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
our fixed assets are recorded at cost 
repairs and replacements of minor items of property are charged to maintenance expense as incurred 
the cost of fixed assets in service and under construction includes an allocation of indirect costs applicable to construction 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method generally between and years 
no gain or loss is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of depreciable property 
with respect to gt t  as of january   we adopted new and generally shorter lives in connection with a tariff application filed on december  with the guyana puc 
in february  the puc accepted these lives for purposes of setting interim rates without expressly approving them  and ordered gt t not to change its depreciation rates in the future without the approval of the puc 
in june  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations or sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
in the case of gt t we have not provided for costs related to the removal of tangible long lived assets because there are no obligations under any of our leases or under any existing or enacted laws  statutes or ordinances or elsewhere that would require us to provide for costs related to the retirement of those assets 
during  we recorded a liability in connection with sfas no 
for approximately  relating to our acquisition of commnet 
such accrual represents management s estimate of our obligations under certain leases to remove equipment placed on towers which are leased from third parties 
any such liability associated with choice s operations are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review our obligations and update our cost estimates 
if laws are enacted or circumstances change  amounts required to remediate the properties may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
we assessed our long lived assets for impairment during  and determined that an impairment charge of million was required to write down the carrying amount of certain assets to their estimated fair value as these assets were identified as being excess  obsolete or carried at values that may not be recoverable due to an adverse change in the extent to which these assets were being utilized in the business  which was caused by the unfavorable business climate within the industry and continued losses in each segment 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we recorded a million impairment charge for goodwill at choice during our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
tax related accruals 
our estimate of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these reflect the assessment of actual current and future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income tax could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law 
we are also subject to tax audits from various jurisdictions 
we make estimates based on the available information and consult with experts where necessary 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or interpretation 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits us to adopt our requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the adoption date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost on grants of employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss share in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement is not anticipated to be material since the company does not currently recognize a benefit of excess tax deductions because of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future us federal and state taxable income 
on april   the sec delayed the effective date of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r in january and will apply the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  a company records compensation expense for all new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the cost of the unvested portion of the award is recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations or fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
we adopted fin in december there was no impact as a result of the adoption of this accounting interpretation on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections or sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and it remained relatively stable until late in the fourth quarter  the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and to approximately during the first quarter of the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on our consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented 
however  the recent declines in and resulted in the recording of a million foreign exchange gain at december  and a  gain in the first quarter of as the devaluation decreased the value of gt t s guyana dollar net liabilities resulting in a gain 
the gain in was substantially offset by other foreign exchange losses incurred during the year  we did not incur similar losses in a substantial majority of our consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in our view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in our view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base and therefore devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has neither approved nor disapproved our position 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies above 
we have approximately million of long term debt at december  the interest rates associated with this debt are variable and subject to change with the market 
an increase in rates will increase our cost of borrowing and have a negative impact on our earnings
