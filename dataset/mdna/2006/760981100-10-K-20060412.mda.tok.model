we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to january our current fiscal year ended on january  fiscal  the prior fiscal year ended on january  fiscal and the prior fiscal year ended on january  fiscal 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
as of january   we operated stores and six outlet stores in states  the district of columbia and canada 
in addition to our retail stores  we operate a direct to customer direct sales channel that includes both catalog and internet  and a wholly owned furniture manufacturer 
over the past several years  we have made significant progress in our evolution 
in  we began the transformation required to reposition our brand 
this included new merchandise offerings  the adjustment of our overall product mix  and also the remodeling of our stores in order to best present the new merchandise 
in addition  to drive sales in our direct channels  we expanded our product assortment of catalog and internet only items 
in  we built on the prior year s successful launch by further refining and expanding our core merchandise offerings  including the repositioning of our premium textiles  bath fixtures and hardware categories and enhancements in our lighting and furniture categories 
we re merchandised our furniture assortment in and revamped our accessories offering 
we also redesigned our catalog in fiscal to improve the presentation of our core businesses and more clearly communicate the quality positioning of our offerings 
in  we finalized the major changes in our assortment with a repositioning of our lighting and window categories 
in addition  our efforts focused on three key priorities create dominant assortments in key categories 
we reconfigured our stores to appropriately present our repositioned lighting and window treatment categories 
these changes  in addition to the remodeling work done in  allow us to project dominance in our key core categories textiles  bath fixtures and hardware  lighting  and window treatments 
our catalog and internet presentations also reflected this improved presentation 
maximize product margin opportunities 
we target core categories that are high margin businesses 
the product and merchandising differentiation we offer our customers  and our sourcing strategies  supports this margin improvement strategy 
additionally  we believe we can further strengthen the overall business s margin through the use of outlet stores to liquidate overstocked and discontinued goods 
in  we expanded our outlet strategy by opening five new outlet stores 
we believe these stores will help us efficiently and cost effectively manage our inventories  reducing the need for the less productive warehouse sales events that we have historically held 
in  we intend to open an additional outlet stores 
strengthen the supply chain 
in  we made progress on improving our in stock position in key categories 
additionally  we began work on upgrading the systems and processes for placing and fulfilling customer orders 
in  we plan to continue this work 
the store remodeling program in required an investment of approximately million and has been reflected as capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flow 
the effort also required the removal of some existing store fixtures 
the cost of accelerating the depreciation associated with those fixtures of million was fully expensed in the second quarter and reflected in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal in  while we continue to drive further progress against our key priorities  we will also pursue brand category extensions such as the restoration hardware outdoor catalog which we initiated in the first quarter of in addition  we expect to test a new concept targeting a broader value market with a catalog mailing in september 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate stores for closure based on underperformance 
during fiscal  we did not close any underperforming stores 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge on the long lived assets of two underperforming stores 
cumulatively since fiscal  we have closed nine stores 
a material decline in sales and other adverse conditions resulting from our failure to accurately anticipate changes in merchandise trends and consumer demands may cause us to close additional underperforming stores 
for fiscal  we have no current plans to close any stores 
summary consolidated statements of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the amount and percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue dollars in thousands  except per share data retail net revenue direct to customer net revenue net revenue cost of revenue and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income loss from operations interest expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss income loss income per share of common stock basic loss income per share of common stock diluted results income from operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we recorded a net expense for income taxes for fiscal of million  which includes a full valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets of million 
net loss was per share  or million for fiscal  compared to net income of per fully diluted share  or million  for fiscal the decrease in operating results of million to million of income from operations in fiscal is primarily the result of a basis point increase in selling  general  and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of revenue  offset by a basis point improvement in cost of revenue and occupancy expressed as a percentage of revenue 
due to the expected growth of our direct to customer channel as a percentage of our total business mix  we believe that catalog circulation costs will continue to increase to support the growth  thus causing selling  general and administrative costs to continue deleveraging as a percentage of revenue in future quarters 
net revenue increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which largely resulted from a million  or  increase in our direct to customer net revenue  and a million increase in revenue generated from our retail segment 
comparable store sales for fiscal decreased  or million  compared to fiscal net revenue related to our outlet stores and warehouse sales events was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal outlet store and warehouse sales events revenue is included in retail revenue  but is excluded from comparable store sales 
the increase in net revenue in both our retail and direct channels can also be attributed to our focus on growing our catalog page count  as the catalog is our primary advertising vehicle 
the cost of revenue and occupancy increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily in support of our revenue growth 
the basis point expansion of our gross margin to in fiscal from in fiscal was attributable to continued improvements in our product margin of basis points  a basis point improvement in supply chain and distribution costs  and a basis point improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense increased to of net revenue in fiscal from in fiscal this included the million non cash charge for the acceleration of depreciation of certain fixtures removed as part of the store remodeling effort  and expressed as a percentage of revenue  was higher than fiscal we also recorded a million impairment charge on the long lived assets of two underperforming stores 
the increase of basis points was driven primarily by a combination of higher catalog circulation costs expressed as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased occupancy and related costs of basis points  increased direct to customer call center and fulfillment costs of basis points  increased other variable costs of basis points  and a basis point increase for the non cash charge associated with the store remodeling efforts 
we recorded an income tax expense for fiscal of million on a pre tax loss of million which included a fourth quarter non cash charge of million to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we concluded  under the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  that our cumulative losses through and our three year cumulative loss through necessitated providing a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of january  under generally accepted accounting principles  when our results demonstrate a pattern of future profitability  in reversal of the current cumulative loss trend  this valuation allowance may be adjusted and may result in the reinstatement of all or a part of the net deferred tax assets 
this fiscal adjustment will have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
due to the valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets  we do not expect any significant income tax benefit or expense for fiscal results income from operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal we recorded a net benefit for income taxes for the year of million 
this reflects the reduction of the income tax provision of million from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in prior years  offset by million of tax contingency and other adjustments 
net income was per fully diluted share  or million for fiscal  compared to a net loss of per share  or million in fiscal the improvement in the income from operations in fiscal of million  to an income of million as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal  is the result of cost leverage achieved on higher sales  expansion of product margins and leverage of store occupancy which was somewhat offset by increased costs of distribution 
the increase in net revenue of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  or  resulted from a increase in comparable store sales  and growth of our direct to customer business  which increased million  or  over fiscal the increase in comparable store sales over fiscal was driven by our brand building initiatives for our core merchandise offerings and the growth of our catalog circulation  which is our primary advertising vehicle 
the cost of revenue and occupancy increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  or  primarily in support of our revenue growth 
these costs rose at a lower rate than revenue as the expansion of product margins by basis points and the leverage of our store occupancy costs of basis points more than offset the higher costs that we continued to experience throughout most of fiscal in our distribution and supply chain activities of basis points 
product margins expanded in due to continued shifts in our product mix to higher margin core businesses such as premium textiles  as well as cost improvements realized from the expansion of our international sourcing programs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of million in fiscal over fiscal  or  was primarily incurred in support of higher sales 
approximately half of the increase was related to catalog production and mailing costs  with one fourth of the increase attributable to higher payroll costs 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to various selling related expense such as credit card fees and to a lesser extent administrative expenses including professional fees as well as brand advertising costs 
as a percent of revenue we generated savings in store payroll costs which declined by approximately basis points  reflecting continued management focus and the implementation of tools to manage payroll expense  as well as reductions in other store expenses 
however  due to rapid growth in our direct to customer segment  higher levels of catalog production and mailing had the effect of deleveraging selling  general and administrative costs by basis points and offset the improvements in payroll expense leverage realized in other cost areas 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense remained at of net revenue in fiscal and cost of revenue and occupancy improved basis points to of net revenue in fiscal our business is highly seasonal  which reflects a general pattern in the retail industry wherein the highest sales and earnings occur during the holiday season 
historically  a significant percentage of our sales have occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in our peak holiday selling season  we incur significant additional expenses in connection with  among other things  the hiring of additional seasonal employees in our retail stores and the production and mailing of a higher volume of our catalogs 
revenue and segment results retail net revenue and segment results fiscal year dollars in thousands retail net revenue retail net revenue growth percentage comparable store sales decline growth income from retail operations income from retail operations percent of retail net revenue number of retail stores at beginning of year number of retail stores opened number of retail stores closed number of retail stores at year end retail store selling square feet at year end number of outlet stores at year end retail net revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in revenue generated from our outlet stores 
comparable store sales for fiscal declined  or million  compared to fiscal additionally  several previously opened stores  although not open long enough to be included in the calculation of comparable store sales  contributed approximately million to fiscal results 
warehouse sales decreased by approximately million compared to fiscal  primarily due to the opening of additional outlet stores 
outlet store and warehouse sales revenue is included in retail revenue  but is excluded from comparable store sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we opened our first outlet store 
during fiscal we opened five additional outlet stores 
the expansion of our outlet store strategy enables us to more effectively liquidate overstocked  discontinued  damaged merchandise and over time  we believe will substantially reduce the need for the less productive warehouse sales events that we have historically held 
for fiscal  income from operations for the retail segment decreased to million from million in fiscal as a percent of segment net revenue  income from operations for the retail segment decreased basis points  to of retail net revenue  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expense  somewhat offset by an basis point improvement in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense for the segment increased by basis points  due to a basis point increase in store selling expenses  basis points related to advertising costs and basis points related to the million remodeling non cash charge 
gross margin improved basis points from a combination of the following supply chain and distribution cost savings of basis points and an increase in product margin of basis points  partially offset by an increase in store occupancy costs of basis points as a percent of revenue 
income from operations for the retail segment includes the costs of retail stores results less the direct costs of the store field operations 
retail net revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal primarily due to a million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal was driven primarily by strong performance in our core merchandise offerings 
income from operations for the retail segment for fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal income from operations for the retail segment  as a percent of segment revenue  increased basis points  to of retail net revenue from of retail net revenue for fiscal  primarily due to occupancy cost leverage of basis points from increases in comparable stores sales and improved margins  offset by higher costs of distribution 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from stores whose gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open at least full months 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net revenue  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
revenue from outlet stores and warehouse sales events are not included in comparable store sales 
direct to customer net revenue and segment results fiscal year dollars in thousands catalog revenue internet revenue total direct to customer net revenue income from direct to customer operations income from direct to customer operations percent of direct to customer net revenue growth percentages direct to customer net revenue number of catalogs mailed pages circulated direct to customer direct net revenue consists of both catalog and internet sales 
direct net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to an expansion of the merchandise offerings in both the catalog and on the internet  as well as a continued focus on increasing catalog and internet only merchandise which drives improved response rates and catalog productivity 
for fiscal  income from operations for the direct segment increased to million  or of segment net revenue  as compared to million  or of segment net revenue  for fiscal this increase of million  or  represents a basis point improvement and is primarily the result of a basis point increase in gross margin due to a basis point improvement in supply chain and distribution costs and a basis point improvement in product margin 
this is offset by a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expense from higher payroll costs of basis points  call center and fulfillment costs of basis points  higher catalog circulation costs of basis points  and higher other variable costs of basis points 
income from operations for the direct segment reflects the results associated with catalog and internet sales  less direct management costs 
direct net revenue during fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal a portion of this increase was the result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  as well as a change in our product mix in the catalog and an increase in catalog only furniture offerings 
additionally  we believe our website marketing efforts coupled with growing consumer familiarity with the internet and growth in high speed internet consumers also helped drive customers to our website 
income from operations for fiscal increased to million  or  of related segment net revenue  from million  or  of related segment net revenue for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in our revenue and improvements in our product margins of basis points  offset by increases in selling general and administrative expense of basis points primarily due to advertising costs related to catalog production and mailing costs 
expenses cost of revenue and occupancy expense for fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal these improvements were attributable to a basis point increase in product margins  a basis point improvement in our supply chain and distribution costs and the decrease of relatively fixed store occupancy costs by basis points 
in fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal these costs rose at a lower rate than revenue due to the expansion of product margins by basis points and the leverage of our store occupancy costs of basis points which more than offset the higher costs that we continued to experience throughout most of fiscal in our distribution and supply chain activities of basis points 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal expressed as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general  and administrative expense increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the basis point increase in expense was driven by higher catalog circulation costs expressed as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased direct to customer call center and fulfillment costs as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased occupancy and related costs of basis points and basis points for the million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of certain fixtures associated with remodeling efforts 
we expect that as the direct to customer channel revenue grows at a faster rate than retail revenue  the costs of catalog circulation will continue to have the effect of deleveraging selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue  as occurred in fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased million  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal approximately half of the increase was related to catalog production and mailing costs  with one fourth of the increase attributable to higher payroll costs 
both of these increases were largely incurred in support of higher sales 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to various selling related expenses such as credit card fees and to a lesser extent administrative expenses including professional fees as well as brand advertising costs 
selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue was consistent at for fiscal and we did generate savings in store payroll costs which declined by approximately basis points  reflecting continued management focus and the implementation of tools to manage payroll expense  as well as reductions in other store expenses 
however  due to rapid growth in our direct to customer segment  higher levels of catalog production and mailing had the effect of deleveraging selling  general and administrative costs by basis points and offset the improvements in payroll expense leverage realized in other cost areas 
interest expense  net interest expense  net includes interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs 
for fiscal  interest expense  net was million compared to million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately half was due to higher average debt levels and approximately half was due to higher average interest rates year over year 
in fiscal  interest expense  net was million  an increase of million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings outstanding 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax expense for fiscal of million on a pre tax loss of million  which includes a full valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets of million 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed can be difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it became evident that we would not meet our forecast of profitability in fiscal  and this lessened the weight that we could assign to future prospects for returning to consistent profitability 
that  combined with our history of losses through fiscal and cumulative losses for the last three years  represented sufficient negative evidence and it was difficult to overcome this with positive evidence under the evaluation guidance of sfas no 
as a result of our assessment in applying sfas  we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was required as of january  the effect was to include a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this adjustment will have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
due to the valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets  we do not expect any significant income tax benefit or expense for the fiscal in fiscal our effective tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal we recorded an income tax benefit for fiscal of million on pre tax income of million 
the fiscal income tax benefit reflects a net benefit of million from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in prior years  somewhat offset by reserves established for certain income tax contingencies 
excluding these items  our effective tax rate would have been for fiscal as of january   we had net deferred tax assets of zero reflecting net deferred tax assets totaling million  which primarily represented the income tax benefit associated with losses reported in prior years and differences in fixed asset bases offset by a full valuation allowance of million 
these losses are subject to federal and state carry forward provisions of up to years 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year dollars in thousands net cash provided used by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash used by operating activities for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities reflects the effect of the million non cash charge for establishing a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
the majority of the increase in net cash provided in fiscal compared to net cash used in fiscal results from the smaller increases in inventory and accounts payable in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in inventory in fiscal of is consistent with the higher sales recorded in the period and does not reflect the same timing of inventory receipts at year end as occurred in the prior year 
for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal the increase in net cash used by operating activities resulted primarily from higher inventory purchases in support of higher sales and the acceleration of inventory receipts at year end including million of shipments in transit due to outdoor furniture and other spring selling programs 
we also experienced acceleration of the timing of payment for goods due to increases in the levels of foreign sourced merchandise that tend to have faster payment terms than domestic vendors 
additionally  net cash used by operating activities increased due to higher prepaid expenses 
these increases in net cash used were partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses balances 
investing cash flows net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to million for fiscal the cash used for investing activities for fiscal primarily related to the million expenditure for the remodeling of the majority of our retail stores  the opening of one retail store and five outlet stores  and capital associated with distribution facility improvements 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million of cash used by investing activities in fiscal the million of cash used for investing activities in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures associated with the opening and remodeling of two retail stores  the opening of our first outlet store and distribution facility improvements and relocations 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal the million increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal primarily related to a million increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  net of debt issuance costs and a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  and net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal substantially all of the change in net cash provided used by financing activities resulted from an increase in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million for fiscal  as compared to a repayment of borrowings of million for fiscal cash financing requirements were higher in fiscal as compared to the same period of fiscal  primarily due to the effect of higher inventory levels overall  and higher inventory of predominately foreign sourced merchandise  which have resulted in an acceleration of the timing of payment for our goods 
we reduced the borrowings outstanding under our line of credit in fiscal due to expense leverage gained on increased sales 
in addition  we received million during fiscal in connection with the settlement of a claim  and million from the exercise of stock options 
on july  the company entered into an agreement the amendment to amend its existing revolving credit facility 
the amendment increased the revolving loan commitment available to the company under the facility from million to million and provided for an extension of the maturity date of the revolving loan from june  to june  in addition  the amendment reduced the interest rate on base rate advances and provided for incremental advances with availability determined from the application of a higher advance rate on eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivables constituting part of the company s borrowing base 
those incremental advances would be subject to higher interest rates 
to the extent that borrowings are outstanding under the incremental advance provision and if the remaining availability for additional borrowing under the facility is less than of the applicable borrowing base for the line of credit at the time  the company would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the amendment also eliminated the lock box restriction except upon the occurrence of certain events  such as an event of default 
other elements of the revolving credit facility remain materially unchanged 
as of january   million was outstanding under the facility  net of unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and there was million in outstanding letters of credit 
as a result of the amendment  the balance of million at january  is considered a long term liability rather than a current liability and has been classified accordingly 
borrowings made under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at either the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
as of january   the bank s reference rate was and the libor plus margin rate was 
borrowings that are incremental advances under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at either the bank s reference rate plus a margin or libor plus a higher margin 
the availability of credit at any given time under the revolving credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula which includes an adjustment to the advance rate against eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivables for incremental advances as described above based upon numerous factors  including the value of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable  and reserves established by the agent of the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the borrowing base formula  and the other terms and conditions of the credit facility  the actual borrowing availability under the facility could be less than the stated amount of the facility reduced by the actual borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
as of january   we had availability under the facility of million 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on the ability to make liens  make investments  sell assets  incur additional debt  merge  consolidate or acquire other businesses  pay dividends or other distributions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any other significant financial or coverage ratio covenants unless the company takes advantage of the incremental advance provision 
if we receive an advance under the incremental advance provision and if the remaining availability for additional borrowing under the facility is less than of the applicable borrowing base for the line of credit at the time  the company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility also does not require that we repay all borrowings for a prescribed clean up period each year 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will satisfy our expected working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  the weakening of  or other adverse developments concerning  our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs or the timing of such needs and we may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we also may need to raise additional funds to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
however  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations 
for more information  please see the section risk factors  in particular the sections we are dependent on external funding sources  including the terms of our revolving credit facility  which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them  and because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a revolving credit facility with certain restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  payments due by period total fiscal fiscal through fiscal through thereafter dollars in thousands operating leases capital leases line of credit interest standby letters of credit trade letters of credit purchase obligations for inventory total operating lease contractual commitments exclude insurance  real estate taxes  and repair and maintenance expenses related to those operating leases 
in fiscal  the company incurred million for these costs 
the costs reflect our long term debt  gross of debt issuance costs of million 
interest payments in the future periods have been reflected based on fiscal debt and interest levels and reflects the june maturity date of the line of credit 
represents estimated commitments at year end to purchase inventory in the normal course of business to meet operating requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements except for our operational lease commitments  we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
related party transactions jason camp  a senior vice president of our company and the son of one of our directors  robert e 
camp  was asked to relocate to california in as part of his job function 
in connection with this relocation  we made a full recourse loan to him in the principal amount of  the interest on the outstanding principal amount of the loan is per annum  compounded annually  and the entire amount of interest and all outstanding principal is due and payable on august   if not earlier pre paid in full with interest 
we lease one of our properties from the previous owner and current employee of michaels 
annual payments made in fiscal  and were  per year 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
for a complete review of those policies  reference is made to our notes to our consolidated financial statements  summary of business and significant accounting policies 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other facts and assumptions  including current and expected economic conditions and product mix  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements sales returns reserve we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates which generally considers both the level of merchandise returns and the time elapsed from the date of sale to the date of the return 
this reserve is booked on a gross basis  reducing both total sales and cost of sales each period 
should actual return rate levels increase by in fiscal or the customer return time lengthen by in fiscal  our results would be negatively impacted by approximately million 
at january  and january   the allowance for sales returns was approximately million and million  respectively 
merchandise inventories our retail inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
manufacturing inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined at standard costs  approximating average costs 
costs include certain buying and distribution costs  including payroll and other costs related to the purchase of inventory 
we write down inventories whenever markdowns reduce the selling price below cost 
additionally  we provide for monthly reserves on inventory based upon our estimate of shrinkage losses 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count 
we also write down our slow moving and discontinued inventory to its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related discounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate long lived tangible assets at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or reporting unit level  as appropriate 
since there is typically no active market for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values based on the expected future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates of future cash flows  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
for the fiscal year ended january   the company recorded a million impairment charge on the long lived assets of two underperforming stores 
self insurance we obtain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks that  by law  must be insured 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  business interruption and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on an actuary report  claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
the projections involved in this process are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual future claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation 
should the amount of claims be more or less than what we estimated or should the costs of claims increase or decrease beyond what we anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods 
at january  and january   we had recorded accruals for these liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes and valuation allowance we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally take into account all expected future events then known to us  other than changes in the tax law or rates  which are not permitted to be considered 
accordingly  if needed we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of valuation allowance would be based upon management s best estimate of the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  the necessity for an allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the effect was to include a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this fiscal adjustment will have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
due to the valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets  we do not expect any significant income tax benefit or expense for the fiscal other considerations the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

r share based payment 
sfas r requires the recognition of compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions in consolidated financial statements 
that expense will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued as of the grant date  for the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for interim periods that begin after december  effective with the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  the unvested portions of previously granted share based payments  as well as the fair value of awards granted after adoption are included in operating expenses over the appropriate service period 
we have decided to use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our stock options  unless additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate for us  or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using this model 
based on stock options granted to employees through january   we expect the adoption of sfas r will increase first quarter expenses by approximately million per share  basic and increase full year fiscal expenses by approximately million per share  basic

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states of america will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
