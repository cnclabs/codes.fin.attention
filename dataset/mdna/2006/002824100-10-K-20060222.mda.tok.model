item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products and diagnostic testing products 
abbott also owns percent of tap pharmaceutical products inc tap that abbott accounts for on the equity method 
the worldwide launch of humira  the spin off of hospira  integration and restructuring activities and the loss of patent protection for some products have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
subsequent to abbott s acquisition of the knoll pharmaceutical business  which significantly increased the scale of abbott s pharmaceutical business  abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business 
abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas immunology  oncology  neuroscience  diabetes metabolism  and viral diseases 
us commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused mainly on primary care and specialty pharmaceuticals 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira  which increased its worldwide sales to billion in compared to million in in  abbott and boehringer ingelheim bi amended their agreement whereby abbott distributed and promoted bi products 
effective january   abbott will no longer distribute bi products but will receive residual commissions 
abbott s gross margins for bi products from the prior agreement in effect through december  were substantially lower than its average gross margin 
sales of bi products were billion 
increased generic competition resulted in us sales of synthroid declining percent in while holding a percent market share 
in  abbott separated its diagnostic segment into four separate divisions immunoassay hematology  diabetes care  molecular  and point of care to better focus on commercial and scientific opportunities 
in early  abbott acquired therasense for billion  and began to integrate it with abbott s diabetes care business 
in late  abbott was informed by the fda that it may distribute the immunoassay products in the us that were impacted by regulatory restrictions imposed in net sales and profits for this business declined over the restricted period  but stabilized in and in  abbott diagnostics launched more than new products 
in the ross segment in  abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for million 
in  abbott completed the spin off of hospira  abbott s former hospital products business 
annual sales of hospira were approximately billion 
as part of the spin off  hospira assumed million of debt 
the historical operating and cash flow results of hospira are presented as discontinued operations 
hospira is contractually obligated to purchase the international hospital assets and operations that were not included in the spin off 
the legal transfer of certain remaining operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states is expected to occur in the first half of in early  abbott reached agreement to acquire guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  subject to boston scientific s acquisition of guidant 
guidant s annual revenues from these businesses are approximately billion 
the purchase price would be billion  plus contingent milestone payments of million 
tap s contribution to abbott s earnings declined in and a part of the decline was due to increased competition for prevacid  tap s largest selling product  and due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors 
in  tap recorded additional litigation reserves of million for an anticipated legal settlement 
abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed abbott to reduce debt and fund acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the global pharmaceutical business  abbott will launch newly approved indications for humira 
abbott will also focus on appropriate market support for synthroid  which became subject to generic us competition in mid  and for sevoflurane  which became subject to generic competition in december in  tap received an approvable letter from the fda for febuxostat 
contingent upon fda approval  tap plans to launch febuxostat in pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications 
abbott expects to submit additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in in the immunoassay business  attention will be focused on improving revenue growth by capitalizing on recent product launches  including the us launch of the blood screening system  prism  launching additional products  and commercial execution of the existing broad product portfolio 
in the hematology business  attention will be focused on the continued launch of cell dyn sapphire and other analyzers 
for diabetes care  abbott will continue the launch of freestyle connect and abbott anticipates the approval of freestyle navigator in upon closure of the acquisition of guidant s vascular business  planning for its integration would be a key activity in the vascular business 
focus in this business will also be on the launch of xact carotid stent and emboshield embolic protection system and the projected approval of zomaxx  abbott s drug eluting stent  in europe 
with a greater focus on consumer marketing  ross will maximize the strength of its core brands and further develop its healthy living market presence 
in the other business segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these rebates and allowances are in two of abbott s domestic segments the pharmaceutical products segment and the ross products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  to state agencies which administer the federal medicaid program and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent  and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately million in other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott s historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending accrual balances each quarter 
in the ross nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf 
a third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf  which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably estimable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market surveys 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   ross had the exclusive wic business in states 
in the domestic pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in thousands pharmaceutical products ross products wic rebates medicaid rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january      provisions     payments     balance at december      provisions     payments     balance at december      provisions     payments     balance at december      adjustments for prior years rebate accruals have not been material 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
as part of abbott s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings  abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
each quarter  abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in the us  abbott s federal income tax returns through are settled  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
except for taxes on dividends that were remitted under the american jobs creation act of  abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs 
with the assistance of outside actuaries  abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate used to measure liabilities as of december  was determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
prior to december   the discount rate was determined by reference to a composite corporate aa bond index 
the health care cost trend rate represents abbott s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
recent low interest rates have significantly increased unrecognized actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   the unrecognized actuarial losses for abbott s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were billion and million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
in  abbott reversed previously recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of million because the assets of certain defined benefit plans were now in excess of the accumulated benefit obligations due primarily to plan contributions in this resulted in a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million  net of taxes 
in and  abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of million and million  respectively  because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets 
this resulted in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million and million  net of taxes  in and  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions 
abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value most of its acquired intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs 
at december  goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately million in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures  abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million 
reserves of approximately million have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  as defined by sfas no 
stock compensation through december   abbott measured compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options and replacement stock options granted to employees and disclosed the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  abbott will adopt sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations 
since there is no market for trading employee stock options  management must use a fair value method 
there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the average life of an option 
abbott began preparing for adoption of the new standard in abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system 
using this data  abbott compared valuation results using the binomial method to the black scholes method abbott had been using and found the results to be comparable 
abbott evaluated whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and did not find any differentiating pattern among holders 
abbott studied its implied volatility and concluded that a combination of historical and implied volatility will be a better measure than historical volatility alone 
abbott also quantified the additional paid in capital amount available for use in determining tax effects of early exercise for measurement of tax expense 
abbott will use the modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  prior years financial results will not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value 
footnote quantifies the effect of application of fair value to and prior awards 
based upon the valuation of stock options granted in the annual grant  which comprise the majority of the grant activity for the year  abbott estimates the impact of the change in stock compensation expense on diluted earnings per share of approximately  which includes per diluted share for the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options 
the expense for stock compensation is dependent on the number of options granted in the future  the terms of those awards and their fair value  and therefore  the effect on diluted earnings per share could change

us sales of synthroid  which is now subject to generic competition  were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
increased sales of humira and kaletra also favorably impacted other pharmaceuticals sales in the international segment in and worldwide sales of humira totaled billion in  million in and million in diagnostic products and international segment products sales were favorably impacted in  and by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar 
diabetes care product sales for the diagnostic products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisition of therasense in the second quarter of in addition  adult nutritionals product sales for the ross products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisitions of zoneperfect in the third quarter of and eas in the fourth quarter of the decrease in sales for pediatric nutritionals in was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals non wic category decline and competitive share loss 
abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
related net sales were million in  million in and million in sales of new products in are estimated to be approximately billion  led by humira in the pharmaceutical products and international segments and incremental sales of approximately million from the acquisitions of therasense and eas 
the expiration of licenses  patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant ongoing generic activities  and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows 
the us composition of matter patent for depakote expires in the pharmaceutical products segment s sales of depakote in were billion 
the pharmaceutical products segment has an agreement with boehringer ingelheim to co promote and distribute three of its products 
in  abbott and boehringer ingelheim amended the agreement 
effective january   abbott no longer distributes or records sales for the boehringer ingelheim products  but will continue to co promote one product  micardis  through march   and will receive residual commissions on boehringer ingelheim s sales of the three products 
the amount of pretax income under the amended agreement will be the same as expected under the previous agreement 
net sales of boehringer ingelheim products in were approximately billion 
in the second quarter  the fda granted approval for generic competition to synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market 
in and  clarithromycin became subject to generic competition in several european markets 
international segment sales of clarithromycin in were million 
in the us  the pharmaceutical products segment markets clarithromycin in two forms  the immediate release and the extended release forms  both of which are covered by additional non composition of matter patents 
in may  the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin in the us expired  and several immediate release generic products were launched by competitors 
manufacturers of the extended release forms of clarithromycin were enjoined from entering the us market due to abbott s non composition of matter patents 
us sales of clarithromycin in and were million and million  respectively 
there may be further generic competition for clarithromycin in the us and other countries in depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents 
upon the december expiration of a court order related to licenses for sevoflurane  baxter is now permitted to market a competitive form of sevoflurane 
in addition  sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition from other competitors in isolated markets outside of the us and further generic competition in international markets is possible 
worldwide sales of sevoflurane in were million 
the composition of matter patent for omnicef expires in may abbott holds an additional non composition of matter patent that expires in the pharmaceutical products segment sales of omnicef in were million 
in mid  the ross segment s co promotion agreement for synagis will terminate 
us co promotion revenues were million in abbott will continue to market synagis  and will market its follow on product  numax  in select international markets and will receive residual commissions on us sales of synagis 
operating earnings gross profit margins were percent of net sales in  percent in and percent in the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due to unfavorable product mix  primarily as a result of increased sales of boehringer ingelheim products that have lower margins than other products in the pharmaceutical products segment 
restructuring charges  discussed below  reduced the gross profit margin in by percentage points 
the gross profit margin in was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix  primarily increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products  as discussed above  in the pharmaceutical products segment 
the gross profit margin for was impacted by a charge of million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for abbokinase  partially offset by favorable product mix  resulting mainly from increased sales in the pharmaceutical products segment 
gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth  and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the ross and pharmaceutical products segments 
in addition  pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the ross products segment in  and the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were unfavorably impacted in and by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in by favorable product mix 
the unfavorable product mix in and was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs 
the gross profit margin in for the diagnostic products segment was impacted by the effects of a fda consent decree 
research and development expense  excluding acquired in process research and development  was billion in  billion in and billion in and represented increases of percent in  percent in and percent in the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to increases of percent in and percent in the restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from by percentage points in in  abbott recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  a pretax charge of million related to the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation 
this charge reduced the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points for and increased selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points over the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the restructuring charges and the charge for the investigation  were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including commercial activities related to sales force expansion and product launches  including abbott s carotid stent and new humira indications 
these increases also reflect the effects of the acquisitions of therasense and eas in increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products and international segments 
restructurings dollars in millions in  abbott management approved plans to realign its global manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial operations 
in  abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets  employee severance and other related charges 
approximately is classified as cost of products sold  as research and development and as selling  general and administrative 
an additional was subsequently recorded in relating to these restructurings  primarily for accelerated depreciation 
as a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries  manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into the following summarizes the restructuring activity for the global pharmaceutical manufacturing operations restructuring employee related and other asset impairments total restructuring charges payments and impairments accrued balance at december  the following summarizes the restructuring activity for all other restructurings  which are individually not material employee related and other asset impairments total restructuring charges payments and impairments accrued balance at december  abbott expects to incur up to an additional in future periods for restructuring plans  primarily for accelerated depreciation and plant and equipment dispositions 
income from tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture abbott s income from the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture was lower in and compared to due to decreased sales due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors  and in by approximately million as a result of an agreement with plaintiffs to settle litigation 
net interest expense net interest expense increased in and due to the impact of higher interest rates on debt levels  partially offset by higher interest income 
net interest expense decreased in due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates 
taxes on earnings the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were percent in  percent in and percent in in  abbott remitted billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of and recorded additional tax expense of million  which increased the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
this was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements  which decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
the effective tax rate for reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these items for was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
the effective tax rate for includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these charges for was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between percent and percent in spin off of abbott s core hospital products business on april   abbott s board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of hospira  inc  payable on april  hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals  medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing 
hospira included abbott s hospital products segment  after that segment s reorganization on january   and portions of abbott s international segment 
the income and cash flows of hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spin off have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings and statement of cash flows 
prior years balance sheets have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of the spin off 
the legal transfer of certain remaining operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states is expected to occur in the first half of these operations and assets are used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets 
these assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the assets and liabilities held for sale consist primarily of inventories  trade accounts receivable  equipment and trade accounts payable  salaries and other accruals 
abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off  defined benefit  post employment medical and dental plan obligations and assets  as of the spin off  for most of hospira s us retired employees and us retirement eligible employees and certain potential liabilities  if any  related to alleged improper pricing practices prior to the spin off in connection with federal  state and private reimbursement for certain drugs 
business combinations and technology acquisitions in  abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than percent equity interest in a small medical products company 
the aggregate cash purchase price was approximately million 
acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million  intangible assets of approximately million and a charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development 
in  abbott acquired additional rights related to humira for approximately million  which will be amortized over years 
in  abbott paid approximately billion for strategic business and technology acquisitions  as follows 
abbott acquired therasense  inc  a leader in the development  manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems  for approximately billion in cash  i stat corporation  a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis  for approximately million in cash  eas  a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands  for approximately million in cash  and spine next  a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices  for approximately million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of future targets 
abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately million 
these acquisitions resulted in a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately billion  non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily trade names  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
in  abbott paid approximately million for strategic business and technology acquisitions  as follows 
abbott acquired zoneperfect nutrition company  a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people  for approximately million in cash  integrated vascular systems  inc  a developer of a novel vessel closure technology  for approximately million in cash  and spinal concepts inc  a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders  diseases and injuries  for approximately million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to million if agreed upon targets are met 
abbott also acquired the assets of jomed nv s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately million in cash 
these acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily product technology  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
had the above acquisitions taken place on january of the previous year  consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts 
in early  abbott agreed to acquire guidant s interventional vascular and endovascular solutions businesses for billion in connection with boston scientific s acquisition of guidant 
abbott would also pay million each upon government approvals to market guidant s drug eluting stent in the us and in japan 
in addition  abbott agreed to provide boston scientific a million percent loan and to acquire billion of boston scientific common stock directly from boston scientific contingent upon the closing of the guidant acquisition 
the acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan 
in addition  abbott transferred approximately million to hospira in in accordance with the employee benefit agreement governing the assumption by hospira of certain defined benefit plan assets and liabilities 
abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan in to to be between million and million annually 
the increased contribution in was due  in part  to the investment of cash remitted under the american jobs creation act of debt and capital at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s and a by moody s investors service 
abbott has readily available financial resources  including unused lines of credit of billion  which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements 
subsequent to the announced potential acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  standard and poor s affirmed their current debt ratings for abbott and maintained their current stable outlook 
moody s investors service indicated they would likely affirm their current debt ratings for abbott and would likely change their current outlook from stable to negative 
in october  the board of directors authorized the purchase of million shares of abbott s common stock from time to time and no shares were purchased under this authorization in in  abbott purchased approximately million of its common shares under this authorization at a cost of approximately billion 
in and  abbott purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of its common shares at a cost of approximately million and million  respectively  under a prior authorization 
in  abbott borrowed billion of long term debt that matures in may with variable interest rates above libor 
proceeds from this debt were invested in short term investments 
abbott issued billion of long term debt in that matures in through with interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of therasense and to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings 
abbott retained million of proceeds from borrowings that hospira assumed as a result of the spin off and used these proceeds to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings 
in addition  abbott retired long term debt of billion in with proceeds from domestic commercial paper borrowings 
working capital working capital was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  capital expenditures capital expenditures of billion in  billion in and billion in were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing  research and development  investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments  and for laboratory instruments placed with customers

contingent obligations abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business  such as assignment of product rights  with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable 
since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties  abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments  if any  under these obligations 
based upon past experience  the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote 
in addition  abbott periodically acquires small companies in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds
