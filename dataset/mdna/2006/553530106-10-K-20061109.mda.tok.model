industry overview msc operates in a large  fragmented industry characterized by multiple channels of distribution 
we believe that there are numerous small retailers  dealerships and distributors that supply a majority of the market 
the distribution channels in the industrial products market include retail outlets  small distributorships  national  regional and local distributors  direct mail suppliers  large warehouse stores and manufacturers own sales forces 
almost every industrial  manufacturing and service business has an ongoing need for mro supplies 
we believe that  except in the largest industrial plants  mro supplies inventories generally are not effectively managed or monitored  resulting in higher purchasing costs and increased administrative burdens 
in addition  within larger facilities  such items are frequently stored in multiple locations  resulting in excess inventories and duplicate purchase orders 
mro items are also frequently purchased by multiple personnel in uneconomic quantities and a substantial portion of most facilities mro supplies are one time purchases  resulting in higher purchasing costs and time consuming administrative efforts by multiple plant personnel 
based on industry estimates  we believe that the administrative costs associated with manually placing a purchase order are approximately per order 
awareness of these high costs and purchasing inefficiencies has been driving large companies to streamline the purchasing process by utilizing a limited number of suppliers which can provide a broad selection of products  prompt delivery and superior customer service 
customized billing practices and report generation capabilities tailored to customer objectives are also becoming increasingly important to customers seeking to reduce costs  allowing such customers to significantly reduce the need for purchasing agents and administrative personnel 
we believe that industry trends and economic pressures have caused customers to reduce their supplier base and move toward more efficient cost saving models  such as those offered by premier companies such as msc 
despite the inefficiencies of the traditional mro purchasing process  long standing relationships with local retailers and distributors have generally perpetuated the status quo 
due to limited capital availability  high operating cost structures and relatively small sales volumes  smaller suppliers to the industrial market are experiencing increasing pressure to consolidate and curtail services and certain product lines in order to remain competitive 
even large suppliers with extensive field sales forces are finding it increasingly difficult to visit all buyers cost effectively and provide the support necessary to satisfy customer demands for control of costs and improved efficiency 
we believe that the relative inability of traditional distribution channels to respond to these changing industry dynamics has created a continuing opportunity for the growth of hybrid business models with direct marketing and direct sales organizations such as msc 
as a result of these dynamics  we have captured an increasing share of sales by providing lower total purchasing costs  broader product selection and a higher level of service 
we believe that we provide a low cost solution to the purchasing inefficiencies and high costs described above 
customers that purchase products from us will generally find that their total purchasing and shipping costs  inventory investment and carrying costs  internal distribution costs and administrative inefficiencies are reduced 
we try to achieve this through consolidation of multiple sources of supply into fewer suppliers  consolidation of multiple purchase orders into a single purchase order  consolidation of multiple invoices into a single invoice  significant reduction in tracking of invoices  significant reduction in stocking decisions  reduction of purchases for inventory  and e commerce and e procurement integration capabilities 
business strategy our business strategy is to reduce our customers total cost of procurement for obtaining and maintaining mro supplies 
the strategy includes the following key elements broad selection of in stock products  offering both name brand and generic products  prompt response and same day shipping  superior  value added customer service  competitive pricing  targeted direct mail marketing  and a commitment to technological innovation 
broad selection of products 
we believe that our ability to offer customers a broad spectrum of brand name and generic mro and metalworking products and a good better best product selection alternative has been critical to our success 
we offer similar products with varying degrees of name recognition  quality and price  thus permitting the customer to choose the appropriate product based on cost  quality and the customer s specific needs 
our customers are increasingly purchasing from fewer suppliers to reduce the administrative burden of ordering from multiple suppliers 
excluding j l  we offer for sale over  products  most of which are generally in stock and available for immediate shipment  and we aim to provide a broad range of merchandise in order to become our customers preferred supplier of mro products 
same day shipping 
our guaranteed same day shipping of products results in next day or second day delivery for customers in most of the continental united states 
this prompt delivery allows customers to reduce the administrative burden of dealing with many suppliers and reduces their inventory investment and carrying costs 
excluding j l  we fulfill our same day shipment guarantee of the time 
j l has its own service model and does not guarantee same day shipping 
our experience has been that areas accessible by next day ground delivery will generate significantly greater sales than areas where next day ground delivery is not available 
the strategic locations of our customer fulfillment centers allow next day ground delivery via low cost ground carriers in states 
superior customer service 
customer service is a key element in becoming a customer s preferred provider of mro supplies 
our commitment to customer service is demonstrated by our investment in sophisticated information systems and extensive training of our associates 
utilizing our proprietary customer support software  our in bound sales representatives excluding j l implement the one call does it all philosophy 
in bound sales representatives are able to inform customers on a real time basis of the availability of a product  recommend substitute products  verify credit information  receive special  custom or manufacturer direct orders  cross check inventory items using customer product codes previously entered into our information systems and arrange technical assistance 
we believe that our simple  one call does it all philosophy of fulfilling all purchasing needs of a customer through highly trained customer service representatives  supported by our proprietary information systems  results in greater efficiency for customers and increased customer satisfaction 
to complement our customer service  we seek to ease the administrative burdens on our customers by offering customized billing services  customer savings reports and other customized report features  electronic data interchange ordering  e commerce capabilities  bulk discounts and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by customers 
targeted direct mail marketing strategy 
our primary tools for marketing and product reference are the annual master catalogs used to showcase over  excluding j l items 
in fiscal  our master catalogs were supplemented by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures covering such specialty areas as cutting tools  measuring instruments  tooling components and maintenance and repair  industrial supply  and hose and tubing 
excluding j l  we use our database of approximately million companies with million individual contacts  and we also purchase mailing lists of prospective customers  to target the distribution of these various publications to specific individuals within an organization whose purchasing history or other criteria suggest receptiveness to mailings of specific publication titles 
the use of specialty and promotional publications  which are produced in house  has resulted in increased productivity through lower costs  increased response rates and more efficient use of advertising space 
msc s publication circulation increased to million including million from j l in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the increase from j l  this slight increase is in line with our continuing strategy to increase the productivity of our direct marketing efforts and increase overall return on advertising dollars spent 
commitment to technological innovation 
we take advantage of technological innovations to support growth  improve customer service and to reduce our operating costs through more effective buying practices  automated inventory replenishment and efficient order fulfillment operations

we believe that significant growth opportunities exist within these segments and that they are an integral part of our customer diversification program 
allocating resources to these segments will allow us to better support these customers  expand our customer acquisition activities and is a key component of our overall growth strategy 
increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force 
we believe that increasing the size of the sales force  providing high levels of customer service and improving sales force productivity can have a positive effect on our sales per customer 
the focus is to enable our sales force to spend more time with our customers and provide increased support during the mro purchasing process thereby capturing more of their mro spend 
opening additional branches in the western region of the united states 
as part of our west coast expansion strategy  we have opened new branches in the los angeles  san diego and oakland areas 
in the first quarter of fiscal  to date  we opened a new branch in fresno 
we believe that this is an opportunity to increase our market share in the western region 
penetrating j l customers with msc s entire sku offering 
we have begun the process of sending our catalog to the j l customers to promote our metalworking products 
we are providing access and training to the j l sales force and incorporating the mro product offering into our direct marketing campaigns 
increasing the number of product lines and productive skus 
we believe that continuing to increase the breadth and productivity of our product line are effective methods of increasing sales to current customers and attracting new customers 
by expanding the product lines and skus offered within existing product categories  including the kennametal line of cutting tools  we seek to satisfy an increasing percentage of the supplies purchases of our customers and to attract new customers 
to continue to provide a diverse product line and maintain profit margins in our competitive market place  we have has also sought out vendors to supply higher margin generic and imported products 
in fiscal  excluding the j l catalog  we added approximately  skus and removed approximately  slower selling skus 
in fiscal  excluding the j l catalog  we added approximately  new skus and removed approximately  existing skus in its fiscal catalog which was distributed in september excluding j l  we currently have over  skus in total 
we generally add skus based on the value they will bring to our customers

we have associations with many of these providers such as ariba  perfect commerce  oracle  sap  infor formerly known as datastream and more 
we continue to evaluate and expand our capabilities in these areas  as the needs of our customers grow in these areas 
expanding next day ground delivery 
our experience has been that sales in areas accessible by next day ground delivery are significantly greater than in areas with second day delivery 
accordingly  our long term goal is to expand our geographic coverage of next day ground delivery throughout the united states  which at some point in the future may require the expansion of existing facilities or the opening of new facilities 
maintain excellent customer support service 
our goal is to anticipate a customer s service needs 
we are continuing to proactively expand the services that we provide and respond and build programs at customer requests 
our one call does it all philosophy continues to be the cornerstone of our service model even as the complexity of the needs of our customers continues to grow 
this focus on our customers needs provides a market differentiator  which enables us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base 
considering and or pursuing selected acquisitions 
the acquisition of j l has played a role in our recent growth 
from time to time  we may consider and or pursue selected acquisitions that either could expand or complement our business in new or existing markets  although at this time  we are not engaged in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any material acquisition candidate 
products excluding j l  we currently offer over  skus  representing a broad range of mro including metal working product lines that include cutting tools  measuring instruments  tooling components  fasteners  flat stock  raw materials  abrasives  machinery hand and power tools  safety  janitorial  plumbing  material handling  power transmission  electrical supplies as well as other categories 
we attribute a portion of our sales growth to the total number of skus offered  which helps our customers reduce the number of suppliers they use to meet their mro needs 
in this regard  we intend to continue to add new products to our existing product categories 
our offering of specific products from multiple manufacturers at different prices and quality levels permits us to offer a good better best product selection alternative 
this value proposition provides similar product offerings with varying degrees of name recognition  quality and price enabling the customer to choose the appropriate product for a specific task on the most cost effective basis 
msc seeks to distinguish itself from its competition through offering both name brand and generic products and significant depth in its core product lines while maintaining competitive pricing 
our in bound sales representatives and technical support personnel are trained to assist customers in making intelligent cost saving purchases 
we believe this approach results in significant amounts of repeat business and is an integral part of our strategy to reduce our customers industrial supply costs 
excluding j l  we purchase substantially all of our products directly from approximately  suppliers 
we are not materially dependent on any one supplier or small group of suppliers 
no one single supplier accounted for more than of our total purchases in fiscal customer fulfillment centers a significant number of our products are carried in stock 
excluding j l  approximately of sales are fulfilled from the customer fulfillment centers or branch offices 
certain products  such as specialty or custom items and some very large orders  are shipped directly from the manufacturer 
our customer fulfillment centers are managed via computer based sku tracking systems and radio frequency devices that facilitate the location of specific stock items to make the picking process more efficient 
we have invested significant resources in technology and automation to increase efficiency and reduce costs  and continually monitor our order fulfillment process 
we currently utilize seven customer fulfillment centers for product shipment located near harrisburg  pennsylvania  atlanta  georgia  elkhart  indiana and reno  nevada  as well as the customer fulfillment centers acquired as part of the j l acquisition  located in elk grove  illinois  livonia  michigan and wednesbury  united kingdom 
when the j l systems are fully integrated into msc which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal both of j l s us customer fulfillment centers will be closed  and their volume will be absorbed into msc s existing logistics network 
sales and marketing our customers include a broad range of purchasers of industrial supply products  from one man machine shops  to fortune companies  to government agencies 
our core business focuses on selling relatively higher margin  lower volume products and  we had an average order size of approximately in fiscal  excluding j l 
we market to small  medium and large companies in a wide range of sectors  including but not limited to durable and non durable goods manufacturing  which  excluding j l  accounted for of our revenue in fiscal education  government and health care 
j l does not accumulate this data  however  a significant portion of their revenue is generated from the durable and non durable goods manufacturing sector 
we also have government and national account programs designed to address the needs of these customers 
one focus area for our sales force is the execution of contracts with both the gsa  the usps and the procurement agencies of numerous individual states 
we believe that expanding our business with government agencies will assist us to better manage periodic downturns in the manufacturing industry 
these national relationships are for mro products and are well matched to msc s product breadth and depth 
gsa customers include military bases  veteran s hospitals  federal correctional facilities  army corps of engineers facilities  etc 
the usps contract connects msc to over  postal facilities nation wide  including bulk mail centers  processing centers  vehicle maintenance facilities  post offices and more 
in addition to the individual state contracts that msc already has or is currently pursuing  we are now pursuing a number of state cooperatives that present msc an opportunity to leverage a single relationship over numerous states and or agencies 
we also plan to continue our successful strategy of growing national account sales through the acquisition of new accounts and the penetration of existing accounts 
the msc value proposition is consistent with the procurement strategies of large  fortune corporations as they attempt to reduce their supplies base by partnering with companies that can serve their needs nationally and drive costs out of their supply chain by using e commerce solutions such as msc s e procurement integration abilities  vmi and cmi inventory programs 
by adding national accounts  we are able to diversify into new customer segments  strengthen our mro product lines and acquire the scale that helps us achieve our purchasing goals 
we have identified hundreds of additional national account prospects and have given our sales team tools to ensure we are targeting and implementing programs with the companies that best fit the msc model 
one of our subsidiaries also offers wholesalers and other distributors the ability to create their own customized mail order catalog  by offering turnkey marketing programs and promotional mailers 
any resulting orders are serviced directly by msc  which stocks and ships the products under the customer s program 
another division of msc offers a line of lower priced products to the budget oriented customer 
excluding j l  we have in excess of  combined active customers companies which have purchased at least once during the past months 
typically  a customer s industrial supply purchases are managed by several buyers responsible for different categories of products 
we target these individual buyers within an organization and distribute publications corresponding to the product categories for which such buyers are responsible 
we are able to implement this direct marketing strategy because of the depth of customer information contained in our information systems databases 
our customers select desired products from our various publications and place their orders by telephone  facsimile  internet or direct computer link 
we have invested significant resources in developing an extensive customer and prospect database 
this database is a key component of our growth strategy 
the customer and prospect database includes detailed information  including company size  number of employees  industry  various demographic and geographic characteristics and personal purchase histories catalog preference  product preference  and order value 
we believe that this variety and depth of information on our customers and prospects offers us a significant competitive advantage in increasing sales to existing customers and attracting new customers 
we rely on approximately including from j l in bound sales representatives at our call centers  customer fulfillment centers and branch offices  who are responsible for substantially all customer contacts and order entries 
these sales representatives are highly trained individuals who build relationships with customers  assist customers in reducing costs  provide technical support  coordinate special orders and shipments with vendors and update customer account profiles in our information systems databases 
our one call does it all philosophy is predicated on the ability of the sales representative  utilizing our information systems comprehensive databases as a resource  to respond effectively to the customer s needs 
when a customer places a call to msc  the sales representative taking the call has immediate access to that customer s company and specific buyer profile  as well as inventory levels by customer fulfillment center on all of the skus offered by msc 
the customer s profile includes historical and current billing information  historical purchasing information and plant and industry information 
msc s in bound sales representatives at our call centers undergo an intensive two week training course  are required to attend regular on site training seminars and workshops  and are monitored and evaluated at regular intervals 
additionally  the sales representatives are divided into teams that are evaluated monthly and monitored on a daily basis by team supervisors 
sales representatives receive technical training regarding various products from vendors and in house training specialists 
we also maintain a separate technical support group dedicated to answering specific customer inquiries and assisting customers with the operation of products and finding low cost solutions to manufacturing problems 
our approximately including from j l direct sales representatives work out of the branches and generate a significant portion of our sales 
they are responsible for increasing sales per customer and servicing existing customers 
the sales representatives accomplish this by taking our product offering  distribution capabilities  customer service models and value added programs directly to the customer 
these associates are the touch point to the customer and provide the organization feedback on competitive landscape  and purchasing trends and help to drive process and service improvement in order for msc to retain and increase our market position 
branch offices we currently operate branch offices  which includes four branch offices that were acquired as part of the j l acquisition 
there are branch offices within the united sates with locations in states  and one branch is located in the united kingdom 
we have experienced higher sales growth and market penetration in areas where we have established a branch office and believe our branch offices are important to the success of our business strategy of obtaining and penetrating new and existing accounts 
as part of our west coast expansion strategy  we opened a new branch in fresno  california  during the first quarter of fiscal publications our primary reference tool is our annual master catalog  which is supported by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures 
j l produces a master catalog bi annually  which is also supported by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures 
we use specialty and promotional publications to target customers in specific areas  such as metal fabrication  facilities management  safety and janitorial 
we distribute specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures based on information in our databases and purchased mailing lists to customers whose purchasing history or profile suggests that they are most likely to purchase according to specific product categories or product promotions 
consequently  specialty catalogs offer a more focused selection of products at a lower catalog production cost and more efficient use of advertising space 
msc s in house marketing staff designs and produces all of our catalogs and brochures 
each publication contains photographs  detailed product descriptions and a toll free telephone number and website address to be used by customers to place a product order 
in house production helps reduce overall expense and shortens production time  allowing us the flexibility to alter our product offerings and pricing and refine our catalog and brochures more quickly 
the number of pieces mailed has increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million including million from j l in fiscal the increase in circulation and number of publications are a result of our ongoing strategy to increase direct mail productivity and increase overall return on advertising dollars spent  as well as the effect of the j l acquisition 
fiscal years ended august  weeks august  weeks august  weeks number of publication titles number of publications mailed customer service one of our goals is to make purchasing our products as convenient as possible 
since a majority of customer orders are placed by telephone  the efficient handling of calls is an extremely important aspect of our business 
order entry and fulfillment occurs at each of our branches and main call centers located at our customer fulfillment centers 
calls are received by customer service phone representatives who utilize on line terminals to enter customer orders into computerized order processing systems 
excluding j l  our telephone ordering system is flexible and  in the event of a local or regional breakdown  can be re routed to alternative locations 
when an order is entered into the system  a credit check is performed  and  if the credit is approved  the order is electronically transmitted to the customer fulfillment center closest to the customer and a packing slip is printed for order fulfillment 
we believe that our relationships with all our carriers are satisfactory 
we guarantee same day shipping of in stock products if the order is received prior to regional cut off times and most customers receive their orders other than custom items and large industrial items shipped directly by the manufacturer within one or two business days of the order date 
j l fulfills orders through each of their branches and call centers  however  j l has its own service model and does not guarantee same day shipping 
customers are invoiced for merchandise  shipping and handling promptly after shipment 
information systems our proprietary information systems allow centralized management of key functions  including communication links between customer fulfillment centers  inventory and accounts receivable management  purchasing  pricing  sales and distribution  and the preparation of daily operating control reports that provide concise and timely information regarding key aspects of our business 
these proprietary information systems enable us to ship to customers on a same day basis  respond quickly to order changes  provide a high level of customer service  achieve cost savings  deliver superior customer service and manage our operations centrally 
our proprietary information systems are also a key component of our e commerce capabilities 
j l has its own service model and does not guarantee same day shipping 
most of our information systems operate over a wide area network and are real time information systems that allow each customer fulfillment center and branch office to share information and monitor daily progress relating to sales activity  credit approval  inventory levels  stock balancing  vendor returns  order fulfillment and other measures of performance 
we maintain a sophisticated buying and inventory management system that monitors substantially all of our skus and automatically purchases inventory from vendors for replenishment based on projected customer ordering models 
we also maintain an electronic data interchange edi purchasing program with our vendors with the objective of allowing us to place orders more efficiently  reduce order cycle processing time  and increase the accuracy of orders placed 
in addition to developing the proprietary computer software programs for use in the customer service and distribution operations  we also provide a comprehensive edi and xml ordering system to support our customer based purchase order processing 
we have developed a windows based cd rom electronic catalog package and provide product information and ordering capabilities on the internet 
msc also supports a proprietary hardware and software platform in support of its vmi initiative which allows customers to integrate scanner accumulated orders directly into our sales order entry system 
in  we introduced our cmi program  which allows our customers to simply and effectively replenish inventory  by submitting orders directly to our website 
in  we expanded both our vmi and cmi capabilities to function directly as front end ordering systems for our e portal based customers 
we run our systems on an ibm iseries platform and utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures  which we believe are adequate to fulfill our needs and are consistent with this type of equipment 
we believe that planned enhancements and upgrades to the next generation of our existing operating platforms will be sufficient to sustain our present operations and our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future 
j l continues to use the existing kennametal computer systems  which are secure  under a service agreement and a significant aspect of the integration will be to migrate these systems on to the msc computer system 
competition the mro supply industry is a large  fragmented industry that is highly competitive 
we face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets  small dealerships  regional or national distributors utilizing direct sales forces  manufacturers of mro supplies  large warehouse stores and larger direct mail distributors 
we believe that sales of mro supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years  which may make the industry more competitive 
our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings  financial resources  services or a combination of all of these factors 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on one or more of the following criteria price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe we compete effectively on all such criteria 
seasonality we generally experience slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months our fourth fiscal quarter as a result of our industrial customers plant shutdowns during this period 
associates as of august   we employed  associates  including  full time and part time associates 
this includes j l associates  of which were full time and were part time 
no associate is represented by a labor union 
we consider our relationships with associates to be good and have experienced no work stoppages

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating the company and its business 
our future operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the known material risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows our ability to timely and efficiently integrate the j l business and realize the anticipated synergies from the transaction will have a significant effect on our future operations 
on june   we acquired  through our wholly owned subsidiary  msc acquisition corp 
vi  all of the outstanding common stock of j l  a former subsidiary of kennametal  inc  for million subject to certain post closing purchase price adjustments which have not been finalized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our future results of operations will be significantly influenced by the operations of j l  and we will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following we will face a number of significant challenges in integrating the technologies  operations  and personnel of j l in a timely and efficient manner  and our failure to do so effectively could have a material  adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we may not achieve the strategic objectives and other anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition  or do so in the time we anticipate and our failure to achieve these strategic objectives or to do so in a timely manner could have a material  adverse effect on our revenues  expenses  and operating results 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition will be included as part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes 
although to date transaction costs have been within our original estimates  in future quarters we may incur charges to operations in amounts that are not currently estimable to reflect costs associated with integrating the operations of two companies 
in addition  we will continue to record additional operating expenses associated with the amortization of other intangible assets 
these costs could adversely affect our future liquidity and operating results 
both companies have the us government and civilian and military agencies of the us government as significant customers 
we face risks associated with integrating the contracting activities of the expanded company  and although to date we have not received any negative indications from the us government  there can be no assurance that the us government will maintain existing  or enter into any new contracts with the expanded company 
as a result of the acquisition  we incurred debt of approximately million 
in addition we are subject to various operating and financial covenants under the new credit facility  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the lender declaring a default and accelerating repayment of the indebtedness 
our failure to repay this debt when due would materially  adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the acquisition  we are a larger  more geographically dispersed and complex organization  and if our management is unable to continue to effectively manage the expanded company  our operating results will suffer 
the acquisition will increase the cost and complexity of complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of with regard to the evaluation and attestation of our internal control systems and may increase the risks of achieving timely compliance 
achieving the benefits of the acquisition will depend on many factors  including the successful and timely integration of the operations of the two companies 
these integration efforts may be difficult and time consuming 
integration efforts between the two companies will also divert significant management attention and resources 
this diversion of attention and resources could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain its past growth performance levels 
the acquisition of j l has played a role in our recent growth 
from time to time  we may consider and or pursue selected acquisitions that either could expand or complement our business in new or existing markets  although at this time  we are not engaged in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any material acquisition candidate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and to acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us and in a timely manner 
the failure to complete or successfully integrate prospective acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
changes in our customer and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate 
from time to time  since our formation  we have experienced changes in our customer mix and in our product mix 
changes in our customer mix have resulted from geographic expansion  daily selling activities within current geographic markets  and targeted selling activities to new customer segments 
changes in our product mix have resulted from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers 
as our large account customer program sales grow  the company will face continued pressures on maintaining gross margin because these customers receive lower pricing due to their higher sales volumes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins 
the company plans to continue its efforts to buy better in order to maintain current margin levels 
although we have been successful in incrementally increasing our gross margin percentage by varying our customer and product mix over the last several years and our strategy has emphasized higher margin  lower volume orders  changes in our customer and product mix  including increased sales to our large account customer programs  could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time in the future 
our industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive 
the business of selling mro supplies in north america is currently undergoing some consolidation 
this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities  which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers 
traditional mro suppliers are attempting to consolidate the market through internal expansion  through acquisition or merger with other industrial and construction suppliers  or through a combination of both 
this consolidation allows suppliers to improve efficiency and spread fixed costs over a greater number of sales  and to achieve other benefits derived from economies of scale 
customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment  and of their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations 
consistent sources of supply provide not just reliable product quantities  but also consistent pricing  quality  services and engineering capabilities 
we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the industry consolidates  and as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 
the trend of our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of the trend or that we can do so effectively 
in addition  as various sectors of the industrial and construction customer base face increased foreign competition  and in fact lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses  we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the mro supply industry  although consolidating still remains a large  fragmented industry that is highly competitive 
we face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets  small dealerships  regional or national distributors utilizing direct sales forces  manufacturers of mro supplies  large warehouse stores and larger direct mail distributors 
we believe that sales of mro supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years  which may make the industry more competitive 
our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings  financial resources  services or a combination of all of these factors 
although we have recently had success in diversifying our customer base  which we believe will assist us to better manage periodic downturns in the manufacturing industry  there can be no assurance that sales to these additional customers will offset the adverse effects of other competitive trends in our industry  including those discussed above 
rising commodity and energy prices may adversely affect operating margins 
as commodity and energy prices increase  the company may be subject to price increases from vendors that we may be unable to pass along to our customers 
raw material costs used in our products steel  tungsten  etc 
and energy costs have been rising resulting in increased production costs for our vendors 
the fuel costs of our independent freight companies are rising as well 
our vendors and independent freight carriers typically look to pass these costs along to us through price increases 
when we are forced to accept these price increases  we may not be able to pass them along to our customers  resulting in lower operating margins 
the risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers  there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets  including changes in national and local government budgets 
additionally  although our customer base is diverse  ranging from one person machine shops to fortune companies and large government agencies  the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders by larger customers may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results from time to time 
work stoppages and other disruptions  including those due to extreme weather conditions  at transportation centers or shipping ports may adversely affect our ability to obtain inventory and make deliveries to our customers 
excluding j l  our ability to provide same day shipping of our core business products is an integral component of our overall business strategy 
disruptions at transportation centers or shipping ports  due to events such as the hurricanes of  the severe winter weather experienced during the third quarter of fiscal and the longshoreman s strike on the west coast in fiscal  affect both our ability to maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 
the risks of war  terrorism  and similar hostilities may adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to having an impact on general economic conditions  events such as the attacks of september  and the conflict in iraq may adversely affect our revenues and our ability to service our customers 
we believe that both the events of september  and the iraq conflict had an adverse effect on our results of operations  although the impact of such events can be difficult to quantify 
disruptions of our information systems could adversely affect us 
we believe that our computer software programs are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend upon our information systems to help process orders  to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  to purchase  sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  to maintain cost effective operations  and to help provide superior service to our customers 
any disruption in the operation of our information systems  including widespread power outages such as those that affected the northeastern and midwest united states in august  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures  which we believe are adequate to fulfill our needs  and we believe that planned enhancements and upgrades to the next generation of our existing operating platforms will be sufficient to sustain our present operations and our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that disruptions of our information systems will not occur 
our success is dependent on certain key personnel 
our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies with respect to any of our executive officers 
customer fulfillment centers expansions 
in the future  as part of our long term strategic planning  we may open new customer fulfillment centers to improve our efficiency  geographic distribution and market penetration and may make  as we have in the past  capital improvements and operational enhancements to certain of our existing customer fulfillment centers 
moving or opening customer fulfillment centers and effecting such improvements requires a substantial capital investment  including expenditures for real estate and construction  and opening new customer fulfillment centers requires a substantial investment in inventory 
in addition  new customer fulfillment centers will have an adverse impact on distribution expenses as a percentage of sales  inventory turnover and return on investment in the periods prior to and for some time following the commencement of operations of each new customer fulfillment center 
additionally  until sales volumes mature at new customer fulfillment centers  operating expenses as a percentage of sales may be adversely impacted 
further  substantial or unanticipated delays in the commencement of operations at new customer fulfillment centers could have a material adverse effect on our geographic expansion and may impact results of operations 
our common stock price may be volatile 
we believe factors such as fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors  changes in economic conditions in the market sectors in which our customers operate notably the durable and non durable goods manufacturing industry  which  excluding j l  accounted for of our revenue in fiscal and fiscal and changes in general market conditions  could cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate substantially 
j l does not accumulate this data  however  a significant portion of their revenue is generated from the durable and non durable goods manufacturing sector 
our principal shareholders exercise significant control over us 
the chairman of our board of directors  his sister  certain of their family members and related trusts  collectively own of the outstanding shares of class b common stock 
consequently  such shareholders will be in a position to elect all of the directors of the company and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of the company s shareholders for approval 
in addition  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our class a common stock 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the class a common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 
as of august  there were  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
in addition  as of august    options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted under the company s   and stock option plans remain outstanding 
as of august   restricted stock or options to purchase an additional  shares of class a common stock were available for grant or unissued  respectively  under the company s omnibus equity plan 
approximately  shares may be sold through the company s associate stock purchase plan 
the omnibus equity plan replaced the   and stock option plans  and the restricted stock plans the previous plans 
the omnibus equity plan covers  shares in the aggregate  and is in lieu of and replaced the unissued shares not covered by previous grants that were made under the previous plans  for an aggregate of approximately  fewer shares than were covered under the previous plans 
our class b common stock is convertible  on a one for one basis  into our class a common stock at any time 
as of august   there were  shares of class b common stock outstanding 
all of the shares of class b common stock and the shares of class a common stock into which such shares are convertible are restricted securities for purposes of the securities act

general our objective is to become the preferred supplier of industrial products for companies throughout the united states 
we intend to increase sales to existing customers and diversify our customer base by expanding government and national account programs  opening additional branches in the western region of the united states  penetrating j l customers with msc s entire sku offering  expanding our direct sales force and increasing their productivity  increasing the number of product lines and skus offered  including the kennametal line of cutting tools through the msc and j l channels  and also including generic and imported products  targeting the circulation and content of our master catalog and our direct mail campaign  continually developing technological innovations employing modern technologies to reduce our customers costs and utilizing extensive e commerce capabilities  making it even easier and more appealing to do business with msc  expanding next day ground delivery into new markets  maintaining excellent customer support service  and considering and or pursuing selected acquisitions in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities through our direct marketing efforts and by increasing the size of our sales force  however  the costs associated with the sales force expansion and our direct marketing program will be incurred in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
we have begun the process of sending our catalog to j l customers to promote our metalworking products  as well as training the j l sales force and incorporating the mro product offering into our direct mail campaign 
historically  we have been able to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers through our direct marketing program  although there is no guarantee that this will continue in the future 
on june   we acquired  through our wholly owned subsidiary  msc acquisition corp 
vi  all of the outstanding common stock of j l  a former subsidiary of kennametal  inc j l provides metalworking consumables  related products and related technical and supply chain related productivity services to small and medium sized manufacturers in the united states and the united kingdom 
j l markets products and services through mail order catalogs and monthly sales flyers  telemarketing  the internet and field sales 
j l distributes a broad range of metalcutting tools  abrasives  drills  machine tool accessories  precision measuring tools  gages  hand tools and other supplies used in metalcutting operations 
the acquisition of j l has played a role in our recent growth 
from time to time  we may consider and or pursue selected acquisitions that either could expand or complement our business in new or existing markets  although at this time  we are not engaged in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any material acquisition candidate 
through fiscal  we continued to benefit from a strong us economy as well as the execution of our growth strategies to increase revenues 
for the year ended august   net sales increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  from the comparable prior year periods 
excluding net sales of j l of approximately million  net sales increased over prior year net sales of billion 
we have been able to gain market share in the national account and government program the large account customer sectors  which have become important components of our overall customer mix  revenue base  recent growth and planned business expansion 
by expanding in these sectors  which involve customers with multiple locations and high volume mro needs  we are diversifying our customer base beyond small and mid sized customers  thereby reducing the cyclical nature of our business 
we are continuing to increase the number of sales associates in existing markets and new markets  and we have opened up new branches in san diego and oakland areas with their own sales force as part of our west coast expansion strategy 
sales related to the new branches did not have a significant impact on our total sales for fiscal we have increased the number of sales associates including those in the new branches to at august  compared to at august  the increase in fiscal includes the addition of the j l sales associates of we expect to continue to increase the sales force to approximately by the end of november  which includes the additional sales associates in the new branch in fresno  as part of the west coast expansion strategy 
by passing on most of our vendors product price increases and independent freight carriers surcharges and raising prices due to market conditions  we have been able to increase gross profit margins to in fiscal  even after taking into account the impact of j l s lower gross margin 
excluding the acquisition of j l  the company generated a gross margin of in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage and net sales contributed to another year of strong cash flows 
as a result of current and prior years cash flows  we were able to return approximately million to shareholders in the form of dividends and made repurchases of million of class a common stock 
as our sales have increased in fiscal we have seen an increase in operating expenses to support the sales growth primarily payroll related costs and freight expenses and increases in medical benefits expenses 
operating expenses have increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal however  the increase in gross margin and operating leverage from prior investments in our infrastructure enabled us to increase operating margins to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal we expect operating expenses to continue to increase during fiscal as a result of increased sales volume  inflation in our salary costs  increased spending on sales force expansion and increased freight and utility costs due to rising energy prices 
during fiscal  we increased direct mail advertising levels compared to fiscal levels 
excluding j l  the number of active customers defined as those that have made at least one purchase in the last months increased at august  to approximately  as compared to  at august  we continue to see the benefits of our more focused mailing strategy as our sales per advertising piece continues to grow 
during fiscal  we expect mailing levels to increase slightly over fiscal levels 
the institute for supply management ism index  which measures the economic activity of the us manufacturing sector  is important to our planning because it historically has been an indicator of our manufacturing customers activity 
excluding j l  approximately of our revenues came from sales in the manufacturing sector during fiscal  including some national account customers 
j l does not accumulate this data  however  a significant portion of their revenue is generated from the manufacturing sector 
the ism is currently at for the month of october this is a lower number than the previous month s ism of  which may be indicative of a deceleration in the growth of the overall economy 
we have historically grown revenues at rates well in excess of the industrial growth and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to do so 
it is possible that the impact of rising energy prices  inflation  interest rates and raw material availability will have an adverse effect on customer order flow 
we believe that companies will be seeking cost reductions and shorter cycle times from their suppliers 
our business model focuses on providing overall procurement cost reduction and just in time delivery to meet our customers needs 
to meet our customers needs and our business goals  we will seek to continue to drive cost reduction throughout our business through cost saving strategies and increased leverage from our existing infrastructure  and continue to provide additional procurement cost savings solutions to our customers through technology such as with our cmi and vmi programs 
results of operations the following table shows selected items of msc s consolidated statement of operations  percentages of sales and comparisons between the fiscal years ended august  and august   and between the fiscal years ended august  and august  results of operations net sales fiscal years ended fiscal years ended august  august  percentage change august  august  percentage change dollars in thousands net sales net sales increased and for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
excluding net sales of j l of million  net sales increased over prior year net sales of billion 
of these amounts  excluding j l  we estimate approximately of the growth for fiscal was attributable to our increase in prices on certain stock keeping units skus based on market conditions in accordance with our pricing strategy 
we estimate approximately and of the net sales growth  for the fiscal years ended and  is attributable to our large account customer programs 
the remaining net sales growth is primarily a result of an increase in sales to our new and existing core accounts 
excluding j l  sales to manufacturing and non manufacturing sectors grew and  respectively in fiscal and and respectively  in fiscal j l does not accumulate this data  however  a significant portion of their revenue is generated from the manufacturing sector 
the primary reasons for the increase in sales to existing customers during fiscal and fiscal is a combination of the success of our sales force in expanding the accounts as well as the continued strength of the us economy 
our national account and government programs sales initiative continued to be successful throughout fiscal and fiscal  and contributed strongly to our total sales growth and the diversification of our customer mix and revenue base 
we expect this to continue into fiscal the growth of the national account and government programs these customers tend to order larger amounts and the strong us economy are the primary reasons for the increase in average order size to approximately  excluding j l  for fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal these large customers tend to require advanced e commerce capabilities 
we believe that our ability to transact with our customers through various portals and directly through our website  mscdirect 
com  gives us a competitive advantage over smaller suppliers 
sales through mscdirect 
com increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as our national account and government programs continue to grow we will benefit from processing more sales through electronic transactions that carry lower operating costs than orders processed manually through our call centers and branches 
these cost savings may be offset by the lower gross margins on national accounts and government business 
we grew the field sales force to associates including j l associates at august   from at august  and at august   an increase of approximately and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as part of our strategy to acquire new accounts and expand existing accounts across all customer types 
included in the sales force numbers in fiscal is the sales team for the san diego and oakland area branches that were opened in fiscal as part of our west coast expansion 
sales related to the new branches did not have a significant impact on our total sales during fiscal we plan to continue to increase the size of the sales force in fiscal which includes adding additional sales associates to continue to execute on its west coast expansion  including a new branch in fresno  which was opened during the first quarter of fiscal excluding the j l catalog  we introduced approximately  new skus in our fiscal catalog and removed approximately  non productive skus 
we believe that the new skus improve the overall quality of our offering and will be important factors in our sales growth 
excluding the j l catalog  we added approximately  new skus and removed approximately  existing skus in our fiscal catalog which was distributed in september gross profit fiscal years ended fiscal years ended august  august  percentage change august  august  percentage change dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal to is a result of our price increases on certain skus based on market conditions  offset by increases in the cost of goods purchased and j l s lower gross margins due to pricing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a non recurring charge to cost of goods sold of million related to a valuation adjustment of the acquired j l inventory 
gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  and excluding the non recurring charge was 
we anticipate that margins will be approximately for the first quarter of fiscal the slight increase in gross margin in fiscal to is primarily attributable to increased efforts to buy better by employing competitive reverse auctions  the benefits of volume buying from our vendors  and expanding our selection of higher margin imported private label and generic products coupled with the strengthening us economy 
operating expenses fiscal years ended fiscal years ended august  august  percentage change august  august  percentage change dollars in thousands operating expenses percentage of net sales the dollar increase in operating expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in payroll and payroll related costs  an increase in freight expense to support increased sales and an increase in stock based compensation expense 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a non recurring charge to operating expenses of million related to j l acquisition integration costs  including severance relating to the departure of certain j l executives 
the j l operating expenses incurred  since the acquisition in june  accounted for approximately one third of the overall increase in operating expenses in fiscal payroll and payroll related costs continue to make up a significant portion of our operating expenses 
these costs increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in headcount and annual payroll increases 
the increase in headcount is primarily the result of the acquisition of j l and an increase in sales associates as part of our overall growth strategy which includes additional sales associates in the new san diego and oakland area branches to build sales as well as an increase in personnel in our customer fulfillment centers and branches to handle increased sales volume 
we expect to continue to build the sales force during fiscal including the addition of associates in the new fresno branch which opened during the first quarter of fiscal  which will result in increased payroll and payroll related costs 
medical costs per covered associate for our self insured group health plan for fiscal were slightly lower than the fiscal levels 
however  medical expenses did increase for fiscal as a result of an increase in participants  primarily related to the j l acquisition 
the increase in stock based compensation is the result of the company adopting fas r as of the beginning of fiscal as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  prior to adopting fas r  we were not required to record any compensation expense for stock options since all of our options were granted at the market price 
stock based compensation expense for stock options for fiscal was million  resulting in a reduction to earnings per share of 
the unrecognized share based compensation cost related to stock option expense at august  was million and will be recognized over a weighted average of years 
the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily a result of the increase in stock based compensation recorded  acquisition integration costs and the amortization of identifiable intangibles related to the j l acquisition  offset by productivity gains and the allocation of fixed expenses over a larger revenue base

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a charge to operating expenses of million related to the settlement of a patent infringement claim 
we experienced an increase in the cost of claims filed by participants for fiscal as compared to fiscal for medical expenses for our self insured group health plan 
medical costs were approximately million greater in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  in part because the fourth quarter of fiscal reflected exceptionally good experience as compared to our experience for fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily the result of productivity gains and the allocation of fixed expenses over a larger revenue base

our cash and investment balances decreased during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as the result of repurchases of our class a common stock and the payment of the special dividend of per share of common stock 
provision for income taxes fiscal years ended fiscal years ended august  august  percentage change august  august  percentage change dollars in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate our fiscal effective tax rate was compared to fiscal of 
the rate increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax exempt interest income from investments and the adoption of fas r 
partially offsetting this was a favorable revision to the estimate of various state requirements and resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies 
the change in the effective tax rate resulted in a million decrease in income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal we anticipate that the effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately

as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products  and facilities expansions 
our primary source of financing has been cash generated from operations 
taken as a whole  cash  cash equivalents and all available for sale securities decreased by approximately million to million at august  from million at august  the decrease is primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund the acquisition of j l and repurchases of the company s class a common stock offset by cash generated from operations as discussed below

vi  all of the outstanding common stock of j l  a former subsidiary of kennametal  inc  for million subject to certain post closing purchase price adjustments

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates we make estimates  judgments and assumptions in determining the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

inventory valuation reserve inventories consist of merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market

inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory

the return rates are periodically analyzed for changes in current return trends 
historically  material adjustments to the estimated sales reserve have not been required based on actual returns 
in the second quarter of fiscal  based on an improvement in return trends we were able to adjust the reserve downward 
if future returns are materially greater than estimated returns the sales return reserve may need to be increased which would adversely impact recorded sales 
reserve for self insured group health plan we have a self insured group health plan 
we are responsible for all covered claims to a maximum liability of  per participant during a september plan year 
benefits paid in excess of  are reimbursed to the plan under our stop loss insurance policy
