overview founded in  biosite incorporated is a medical diagnostic company utilizing a biotechnology approach to create a broad and diverse portfolio of market leading diagnostic tests 
our business model is designed to be fully integrated from discovery to customer  with a focus on patenting novel protein biomarker panels  manufacturing complex products at appreciable profit margins  employing strategic clinical studies and trials to validate our products diagnostic utility  and an emphasis on education when marketing our pioneering diagnostics directly to healthcare providers 
our products are principally sold to acute care hospitals  which number approximately  in the united states 
to market our products  we utilize a direct sales team that focuses its efforts primarily on larger centers with more than beds and smaller hospitals that are high volume users of our products 
we also use a network of distributors both in the united states and internationally 
the fisher healthcare division of the fisher scientific company  or fisher  distributes our products primarily in hospitals in the united states and supports our direct sales force  particularly in smaller hospitals 
we have a distribution agreement with fisher that extends through december   subject to some limited exceptions pursuant to which a party may elect to terminate the agreement earlier 
sales to fisher represented and of our product sales in and  respectively 
we primarily utilize distributor relationships with physician sales services  or pss  and henry schein  inc  or henry schein  to market our products to physician office laboratories in the united states 
in international markets  we have established direct selling efforts in several countries and utilize a network of country specific and regional distributors in other areas 
since  we have initiated direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  the united kingdom  italy and the netherlands 
in the future  we may transition to direct sales and distribution of our products in additional countries 
we also employ a field based network of clinically experienced individuals that support our direct sales force by providing pre and post sale education and training 
our total revenues for were million  representing a increase over this growth resulted largely from increased sales of our triage bnp test products  which are primarily used to aid in the diagnosis of heart failure 
our meter based triage bnp test  launched domestically in january  was the first blood test available to aid in the detection of heart failure and benefited from a semi exclusive position in the market  until the entry of direct competition in june in december  we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market our triage bnp test for beckman coulter immunoassay systems and we began selling the product in the united states in january as a result  a customer can perform b type natriuretic peptide  or bnp  testing using either our rapid  portable triage meterplus system or any of beckman coulter  inc s automated immunoassay systems 
today  our triage bnp test products are among several fda cleared blood products for use as an aid in the diagnosis of heart failure 
these include products from bayer healthcare  dade behring  roche diagnostics and abbott laboratories  which offer products based on large  centralized automated testing platforms 
in addition  abbott laboratories has announced that it will offer a bnp test on its i stat meter product  which is designed for use at the point of care 
we have experienced  and continue to experience  competition from these companies and anticipate competition from others in the future 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that are more effective or more commercially attractive than the triage bnp tests 
moreover  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully with these and other competitors in the future 
with several diagnostic products commercialized  our focus has expanded to include the search for proprietary disease markers that can potentially be applied to our testing platforms or to platforms marketed by other diagnostic companies with whom we might collaborate 
to that end  in we launched biosite discovery 
through biosite discovery  we leverage our expertise in phage display antibody development to access protein targets via collaborations with clinical institutions or commercial companies  or via our internal research and licensing programs 
biosite discovery has also attracted the interest of leading clinical collaborators  who provide patient samples and assist in the analysis of clinical data 
the discovery of new disease markers and the extension of applications for existing products could enable us to expand our product sales into other healthcare market segments 
included in contract revenues for the year ended december  are annual maintenance fees on antibodies produced by biosite that continue to be used in research and development programs of our partners 
we have reported consecutive quarterly operating profits since the third quarter of  after incurring quarterly operating losses during the prior seven quarters 
our operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our growth or operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by us or by securities analysts 
we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and future operating results are discussed below under the heading liquidity and capital resources  and in item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies involving management estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and related disclosures  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales upon shipment  including to fisher and our other distributors  unless there are significant post delivery obligations or collection is not considered probable at the time of shipment 
generally  we do not have any significant post delivery obligations associated with our product sales 
we accrue for warranty costs and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience  trends and estimates 
our collaborative development agreements generally contain specific payments for specific activities or elements of the agreements 
among the payments we might receive under the agreements are up front technology access fees  research funding  antibody development fees upon the delivery of antibodies  annual maintenance fees on targets for which we have produced antibodies for as long as the targets remain in development by our collaborators  milestone fees on drug targets that reach certain development milestones and royalties should products successfully be commercialized as a result of the collaboration 
up front technology access fees are recognized over the term of the agreement or ongoing research period  as applicable  unless we have no further continuing performance obligations related to the fees 
research funding is recognized over the applicable research period on a straight line basis  which approximates the underlying performance 
milestone payments  such as antibody development fees and clinical milestones  are recognized when earned  as the milestone events are substantive and their achievability is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
contract revenues that are based on the performance of and collection by our collaborators or their partners are deferred until such performance is complete and collection is probable 
we believe that each payment element of these agreements represents the fair value of the element at the date of the agreement 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
warranty reserves 
our warranty reserve primarily relates to warranty coverage extended with the placement of the triage meterplus 
the triage meterplus is manufactured by lre technology partners gmbh  or lre  who provides biosite a contractual warranty against manufacturer s defects and poor workmanship 
should a meter not function to specification and the cause is determined to be due to a manufacturer s defect or poor workmanship  the malfunctioning meter would be returned to lre for replacement or repair 
lre would incur and bear all the cost to replace or repair the meter 
we have established a warranty allowance for the costs to replace or repair meters that would not be covered by lre s warranty 
historical experience and trends detailing returns and replacement activity in total and those that have been covered by lre s manufacturer s warranty are used in estimating our warranty allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential uncollectible accounts receivable arising from our customers inability to make required payments 
our estimate is determined by analyzing historical bad debts  customer payment history and patterns  customer creditworthiness  and economic  political or regulatory factors affecting the customer s ability to make the required payments 
inventories and related allowances 
net inventories are valued at the lower of the first in  first out  or fifo  cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess  obsolete and potential scrap inventories 
the estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based on inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales and assumptions about the likelihood of scrap or obsolescence 
during our manufacturing processes  some work in process inventories require additional testing or re work 
these inventories are separately tracked and reviewed on a monthly basis to determine their status and an estimated reserve for potential scrap is calculated 
we utilize a standard cost system to track our inventories on a part by part basis 
when necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs on a fifo cost basis 
intangible and other long lived assets 
at december   we had approximately million of long lived assets  including million of land  million of buildings and improvements  million of building construction in progress   of leasehold improvements  million of equipment  furniture and fixtures and million of capitalized license rights and other assets 
building  building improvements  leasehold improvements  equipment  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining lease term 
we lease five buildings in the san diego with leases that expire between march and june useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue directly or indirectly 
license rights related to products for sale are amortized to cost of sales over the life of the license  generally not to exceed years  using a systematic method based on the estimated revenues generated from products during the shorter of the license period or years from the inception of the license 
the estimated revenues used as the base by which we amortize the license rights include only estimated sales for products we are currently selling and do not include any estimated revenues expected to be realized during the license amortization term from products still in development today 
our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
income tax reserve 
it is our policy to record tax benefits only if we conclude that it is at least probable that the deduction or credit will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
in the period that permanent tax benefits  including research and development tax credits  are generated  we recognize the tax benefits at their estimated net realizable value 
with regard to research tax credits  the determination of qualified expenses and activities involves judgment 
tax authorities have regularly examined and challenged research and development tax credits claimed by companies and have disallowed tax credit amounts based on the tax authorities evaluation and judgment 
we reduce tax benefits to their estimated net realizable value based upon our management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the estimate of the net realizable value of the tax benefits 
valuation of stock based compensation payments 
with respect to accounting for stock based compensation payments to our employees for periods through december   we followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
during these periods  stock options issued to non employees were recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or fas  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and were periodically remeasured as the stock options vest 
beginning january   we will adopt fas no 
revised  a revision to fasb statement no 
 or fas r 
included in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements is adjusted pro forma information regarding net income as required by fas no 
 which has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock based compensation under the fair value method of that statement for the periods presented 
for all options granted on or after april   we changed our fair value option pricing model from the black scholes model to a binomial model 
the fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted prior to april  was determined using the black scholes model 
we believe that the binomial model considers characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not available under the black scholes model 
similar to the black scholes model  the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield rate and risk free interest rate 
however  in addition  the binomial model considers the contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
the valuation of stock based compensation instruments is determined at the date of grant and includes assumptions with regards to expected life of stock options  which is primarily based on the historical exercise behavior of our employees  and stock purchase rights issuable under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  expected volatility during the expected life of the stock options and stock purchase rights using historical and implied volatility  expected dividends during the expected life of the stock options and stock purchase rights and the expected risk free interest during the expected life of the stock options and stock purchase rights 
recent developments triage mpo fda k filing in december  we submitted a k premarket notification to the fda for diagnostic tests for myeloperoxidase  or mpo  a biomarker of inflammation in the walls of coronary arteries 
mpo appears to be an indicator of unstable atherosclerotic plaque  and has been shown to elevate earlier than current markers of cell death 
we licensed certain diagnostic rights to mpo in under an agreement with the cleveland clinic foundation and prognostix  inc mpo is believed to be useful as an aid in the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction and could signal risk for heart disease or heart attack in patients with chest pain or acs 
subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory approvals  we plan to offer a single triage mpo test and a second generation triage cardioprofiler panel that will include mpo 
we believe the addition of mpo to the triage cardioprofiler panel can advance the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the product  which is used for emergency assessment of chest pain patients 
the panel currently measures the levels of troponin and its complexes  along with ck mb  bnp and myoglobin in blood and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction heart attack  diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure and risk stratification of patients with acs 
roche litigation in december  we announced that we are in discussions with roche regarding a potential settlement of both cases in our pending litigation 
biosite and roche filed joint requests to stay the litigation in the united states district courts in the southern district of california and the southern district of indiana through april both stays have been granted 
change in management in january  we announced that tom watlington  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  will leave biosite by the end of the first quarter of in march  we entered into a transition agreement with mr 
watlington under which  among other things  he will continue to provide consulting services to biosite through the end of stock repurchase program in february  we announced a program to repurchase up to million of biosite common stock 
as of march   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million  including commissions 
results of operations years ended december  and product sales 
product sales by product family were as follows in thousands year ended december  increase increase product family decrease decrease cardiovascular products triage bnp test products triage cardiac panel triage cardioprofiler and profiler shortness of breath panels triage d dimer test n a triage meterplus products total cardiovascular products other products triage drugs of abuse  tox drug screen products and triage stroke panel triage microbiology products total other products total product sales product sales for were million  representing an increase of compared to million for the million increase in total product sales consisted primarily of product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume of million  partially offset by a decrease in product sales resulting from lower average selling prices of approximately million 
in  growth in the sales volume of our triage bnp tests represented of the product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume 
primarily as a result of significant fluctuations in customer demand  inventory levels of our products have been and in the future may be below or above targeted stocking levels 
our product sales are also impacted by the buying patterns of our distributors 
additionally  we believe that our products are subject to some seasonality in their use 
higher utilization rates of our triage bnp tests may be due to a higher number of ed visits by patients exhibiting shortness of breath  a symptom of heart failure and of influenza 
however  higher utilization may also result from greater awareness  education and acceptance of the uses of our triage bnp test products  as well as additional users within the hospitals 
product sales to our distributors in future periods will be impacted as we and our distributors attempt to adjust our distributors inventories to targeted stocking levels and as we seek continued improvement in our effectiveness and efficiency in adjusting our manufacturing output and capacity 
product sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage bnp tests  triage cardiac panel  triage cardioprofiler panel  triage profiler shortness of breath panel  triage d dimer test  and triage meterplus  totaled million for this represented an increase of as compared to million for the product sales growth of our cardiovascular products was primarily due to growth in sales volume of our triage bnp tests of million  and of our triage profiler panels of million 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in product sales due to a decline in the average sales price of our triage bnp tests of million 
our product sales growth rate for our triage bnp tests in future periods may be lower than in the past periods because of increased competition from alternative tests and testing platforms that aid in the diagnosis of heart failure 
in addition  because most us hospitals are already performing some form of testing for natriuretic peptides  the sales growth for our triage bnp tests resulting from the addition of new hospital customers in the united states may be less than what we have experienced in the past 
in addition  as the global market for bnp testing matures and more competitive products become available  the average sales price for our triage bnp tests may continue to decline  which would negatively impact our revenue from product sales 
product sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were million for this represented an increase of as compared to million for the increase in sales of these products for was primarily due to the growth in sales volume of our triage tox drug screen of million 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of the triage drugs of abuse panel of million 
we believe that domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees 
contract revenues for were million  compared to million for contract revenues recognized during and consisted primarily of research funding 
during both and  we recognized million of research funding from an alliance with medarex inc  which expires in the increase in contract revenues for as compared to was related to an increase of  in annual maintenance fees on antibodies produced by biosite that are used in research and development programs of our partners 
the increase was partially offset by a  decrease in research milestone payments 
biosite discovery activities are performed and its costs are incurred by certain of our research and development teams 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our partners  which generate our contract revenues  and on internal research and development programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were million for  compared to million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales for was million  representing an increase of compared to million for the million increase in gross profit from product sales in  compared to  consisted of million attributable to product sales growth and of million resulting from changes in the gross margins of our different products 
the overall gross margin for increased to  compared to for the increase in the overall gross margin was primarily due to operational improvements that resulted in greater manufacturing efficiencies and lower scrap 
although our gross profits may continue to grow  we expect our overall gross margin to fluctuate as a result of the changing mix of products sold with different gross margins  changes in our manufacturing processes or costs  and competitive pricing pressures 
any new products that we successfully develop  acquire and sell may change our future gross margins 
manufacturing inefficiencies  including inefficiencies experienced as we attempt to manufacture newer products on a larger scale  and increase or decrease our manufacturing capacity  production volumes and manufacturing output will also impact our gross margins 
our manufacturing overhead costs are spread over the changing production volumes manufactured during a quarter on a first in  first out basis 
we expect the cost of product sales in to be materially higher than due to the expensing of share based compensation  such as stock options  as a result of the adoption of fas r 
we also expect that our fixed occupancy costs will significantly increase as we continue to transition our manufacturing operations to our new corporate complex  in which our manufacturing operations will occupy a much larger space than in our existing facilities 
we may also incur unexpected costs and expenses in connection with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex  or we may experience unanticipated decreases in productivity and other losses due to inefficiencies relating to this transition or due to delays  whether due to regulatory approvals for the validation of the manufacturing facilities  or from other causes 
for instance  the scale up of manufacturing at our new corporate complex could result in lower than expected manufacturing output and higher than expected product costs 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur some duplicate facilities expenses during the period of time in which we transfer our operations to the new corporate complex as we will transfer our operations in stages 
any delays could cause us to incur these duplicate expenses for longer than we currently anticipate 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses for were million  representing an increase of  compared to million for at december   our headcount for sales  marketing and administrative functions totaled employees  compared with employees at december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources  and administrative support 
the expansion of our direct sales  marketing and distribution operations in europe resulted in increases in sg a expenses of million in as compared to we began direct sales  marketing and distribution in certain european countries at different dates from july to february  and we are continuing to scale up our direct operations in europe 
in the future  we also may transition to direct sales and distribution in additional countries  which will require additional sales  marketing and administrative resources outside the united states 
our facilities expenses related to sg a activities increased by approximately million in  as compared to  primarily due to costs related to the relocation to our new corporate complex in also  as a result of growth in sales activities  marketing activities and general administrative resources for  employee related expenses in the united states increased approximately million as compared to we expect sg a expenses to materially increase in as compared to due to the expensing of share based compensation  such as stock options  as a result of the adoption of fas r on january  we also expect sg a expenses in to be higher than in  as we continue to increase our sales  marketing  clinical education  technical service and general administration resources in the united states  as well as continue to build our direct sales  distribution and administrative infrastructure in europe 
we also expect other non employee related costs  including sales and marketing program activities for our new products  to grow as our overall operations grow 
the timing of these increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products as well as the timing of any new product launches 
we also expect sg a expenses to increase due to costs associated with our continuing consolidation from our previous facilities to our new corporate complex and higher occupancy costs primarily due to increased square footage at the new corporate complex and  for a period of time  occupancy costs of both facilities 
research and development expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses for were million  representing an increase of approximately compared to million for the increase in r d expenses for consisted primarily of an increase in employee expenses of million 
additionally  for  we experienced increases in consultant  clinical studies and patent related expenses of million and increases in facilities costs of  as compared to during  our r d resources were focused primarily on product development for potential new diagnostic products  including a new acs panel and other diagnostic products for critical health conditions such as sepsis and abdominal pain 
we also focused on the development of potential improvements to our existing products  including our triage cardiac panel  manufacturing processes and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our r d group and were primarily related to biosite discovery 
we expect r d expenses in to be higher than in and to relate primarily to the expensing of share based compensation  such as stock options  due to the adoption of fas r  product development efforts  including the development of potential diagnostic products for acs  stroke  mpo  sepsis  acute kidney injury and abdominal pain  clinical studies  including studies associated with potential diagnostic products for stroke and studies related to the exploration and validation of other potential uses for our triage bnp tests  engineering development programs intended to miniaturize the triage meterplus platform and automate and improve manufacturing processes  manufacturing scale up for potential new products  including the triage stroke panel  costs associated with fda submissions for products under development  including the triage stroke panel  and other interactions with the fda  biosite discovery activities  performance based compensation  and costs associated with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex and higher occupancy costs primarily due to increased square footage at the new corporate complex and occupancy of both facilities for a period of time 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products  as well as the timing and progress of our r d efforts 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes were million in  compared to  in the expenses consisted of legal costs related to two lawsuits involving roche diagnostics corporation and several of its affiliates 
in november  roche and certain of its affiliates filed a complaint in the united states district court  southern district of indiana  indianapolis division alleging that biosite is infringing two patents  us patent  and us patent  owned by roche and or its affiliates 
we believe these allegations of infringement are without merit and we are vigorously contesting these claims 
also  in november  we filed a complaint in the united states district court  southern district of california alleging that roche diagnostics corporation and roche diagnostics gmbh are infringing two patents  us patent  and us patent  owned by biosite 
in october  we amended our complaint  further alleging infringement of a third biosite patent  us patent  all of the biosite patents relate to methods for the measurement of cardiac troponin forms 
in december  we announced that we are in discussions with roche regarding a potential settlement of both pending cases 
biosite and roche filed joint requests to stay the litigation in the united states district courts in the southern district of california and the southern district of indiana through april  both of which requests have now been granted 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million for  compared to million for the increases resulted primarily from an increase in interest income due to higher average balances of cash and marketable securities and higher interest rates in compared to provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the estimated tax credits and other permanent differences between our reported and tax results in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  equivalent to an effective tax rate of 
for  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  equivalent to an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in r d tax credits generated in as compared to the r d tax credits were limited by the statutory restriction that limits the tax credits to research expenses as a percentage of product sales 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our tax credits and other net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for were million  representing an increase of compared with million for the million increase in total product sales consisted of million of product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume  and million resulting from an increase in average selling prices of our products 
growth in the sales volume of our triage bnp tests represented of the product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume 
product sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage bnp tests  triage cardiac panel  triage profiler panels and triage meterplus  totaled million for this represented an increase of as compared with million for the product sales growth of our cardiovascular products for was primarily due to the growth in sales volume of our triage bnp tests which totaled million 
included in the sales volume growth of our triage bnp tests was million related to our triage bnp test for beckman coulter immunoassay systems which we began selling in january in the united states 
product sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were million for this represented an increase of compared with million for the increase in sales of these products was primarily due to the million growth in sales volume of our triage tox drug screen 
there was also a million increase in product sales resulting from an increase in our average net selling prices for these products 
contract revenues 
contract revenues for were million  compared with million for we recognized million of research funding from our alliance with medarex during both and other contract revenues recognized during those periods of and included antibody fees  milestone payments and license fees 
biosite discovery activities were performed  and its costs are incurred  by certain of our research and development teams 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our partners  which generated our contract revenue  and on internal research and development programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for compared with million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales for was million  representing an increase of compared with million for the million increase in gross profits consisted of million that resulted from product sales growth  and million resulting from changes in the gross margins of each of our products 
for and  the gross margins for our cardiovascular products were and  respectively  while our gross margins for our triage drugs of abuse panel and other products were and  respectively 
sales of our cardiovascular products represented of our product sales for  compared with for the overall gross margin for was  compared with in the increase in the overall gross margin was primarily due to the changing mix of our products sold with differing gross margins  and greater manufacturing efficiencies generated primarily from higher production volumes and manufacturing output during the manufacture of products sold in compared with selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in at december   our headcount performing sales  marketing and administrative functions totaled employees  compared with employees at december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources in the united states  and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on our financial performance 
our employee related expenses in the united states increased million from to the formation and expansion of our direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  italy and the uk resulted in an increase in sg a expenses of million from to expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and scale up in additional markets such as physician offices  marketing activities relating to new products  and increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations resulted in an increase of million from to research and development expenses 
r d expenses for were million  representing an increase of compared with million for the increase in r d expenses consisted primarily of a million increase in employee expenses  an increase in consultant  clinical studies and patent related expenses  including involvement in pending interference and opposition proceedings  totaling million  and an increase in supplies used in our r d activities of million 
during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on product development for potential new diagnostic products  including the triage profiler cp panel  triage profiler sob panel  triage d dimer test  triage stroke panel and other diagnostic products for critical health conditions such as sepsis and abdominal pain 
we also focused the development of potential improvements to our existing products  including our triage cardiac panel  and manufacturing processes and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group and were primarily related to biosite discovery 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled  we did not incur any such expenses during the expenses consisted of legal costs related to our two pending litigations with roche diagnostics corporation and several of its affiliates 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million for  compared with million for our interest income during was  lower than interest income earned in during  for liquidity purposes in anticipation of cash needs  including new corporate complex construction costs  as well as anticipation of rising interest rates  we maintained a larger portion of our cash and marketable securities in cash and cash equivalents  which yielded lower interest income than our marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income was offset by an increase in realized gains primarily from the collection of intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies of  in provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for compared with million in our annual effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in our overall state tax rate of as more of our product sales and income was apportioned to states with lower income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our sources of cash have included cash generated from operations  primarily from the collection of accounts receivable resulting from product sales  private and public placements of equity securities  including cash generated from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  proceeds from equipment financing  cash received under collaborative development agreements  and interest income 
our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing and r d activities and other working capital needs  and the purchase of land and construction of facilities  and expenditures related to equipment and leaseholds used to increase our manufacturing capacity  improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our research and development activities 
other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include the following we have experienced gross margins greater than and operating margins greater than in each of the last three years 
as our product sales have increased significantly since  our gross profit and operating income have increased significantly as well  providing us with an increasing source of cash to finance the expansion of our operations  and fisher  which accounted for of our product sales in  has historically been a timely and predictable payor of its outstanding accounts receivable 
we have a distribution relationship with fisher that expires on december  as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared with million as of december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to million of cash generated from operating activities  for which the sales volume growth of our triage bnp tests was the primary driver 
additionally  we generated million in cash from proceeds from the issuance of shares under our stock plans during we believe the increased activity related to the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan by employees was driven by increases in the market price of our common stock 
future proceeds from exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan will depend primarily upon the behavior  expectations and needs of the plan participants and upon our stock price 
the primary non operating cash outflows during were cash used for the construction of our new corporate complex  which totaled million  and for equipment and other fixed asset purchases of million 
in february  we announced a program to repurchase up to million of biosite common stock 
as of march   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million  including commissions 
in october  we completed our purchase of land for the construction of our new corporate complex 
we purchased a total of usable acres for approximately million 
through december   we have expended an additional million for the design and construction of the new corporate complex 
we expect the new complex to provide us with up to  square feet of space  to be constructed in phases as needed 
the first phase will provide us with approximately  square feet of space 
the total cost of the land and the construction of the first phase are estimated to cost approximately million 
we plan to finance the remaining construction costs using our available cash 
as of march   our research and development staff  selling  general and administrative staff and a portion of our manufacturing operations have relocated to the new corporate complex 
we expect to complete the other buildings in the first phase of construction during the first half of and to relocate our remaining operations in stages once the buildings are ready for use 
we expect our occupancy costs to increase primarily due to increased square footage 
should there be a downturn in our business or the markets in which we compete  we may not have a need to expand our facilities as we have planned 
as a result  we may then seek an alternative use for all or a portion of the property  or seek to sell the property  which may have a negative impact on our operating results 
we may also incur unexpected costs and expenses in connection with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex  or we may experience unanticipated decreases in productivity and other losses due to inefficiencies relating to this transition  or delays in obtaining any required approvals or clearances from regulatory agencies related to the validation of the manufacturing facilities 
for instance  the scale up of manufacturing at our new corporate complex could result in lower than expected manufacturing output and higher than expected product costs 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur some duplicate facilities expenses  such as rent  as we are transferring our operations to the new corporate complex in stages 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include any repurchase of our common stock  the remaining construction costs in the first phase of our new corporate complex  as well as our other facilities expansion needs  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the united states and abroad  expenditures for equipment and other fixed assets for use in our new corporate complex  and for manufacturing and research and development purposes  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  new discovery and product development efforts  clinical studies  and the continued advancement of research and development efforts  the prosecution  defense and resolution of ongoing license and patent disputes  and potential milestone payments under licensing agreements that cover intellectual property rights of third parties 
for  we plan to spend approximately million in cash for capital expenditures  primarily for manufacturing and r d equipment  furniture  fixtures and computer equipment 
we intend to use our currently available cash and cash we expect to generate from operating activities to address our capital requirements 
we expect that the performance of our product sales and the resulting operating income will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
factors such as interest rates and available cash will impact our decision to continue to utilize credit arrangements as a source of cash 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock plans will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months  except in the event that we determine to accelerate the development and or construction of the remaining phases of our corporate complex 
we have used available cash balances to purchase the land for our new corporate complex and pay for the design and construction costs to date 
for the remainder of the construction costs  we plan to use our available cash 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs  timing and effectiveness of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities and resources  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our facilities expansion needs  including the construction of our new corporate complex  the effects of competition  including products competitive with our triage bnp tests  from companies with greater financial capital and resources  the effect on sales and cash receipts for our triage bnp tests due to market saturation in the hospital market for natriuretic peptide testing in the united states  regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays  the impact of the prosecution  defense and resolution of ongoing and potential future license and patent disputes  the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain regulatory approval and market acceptance and become and remain competitive  seasonal or unanticipated changes in customer demand  the scope  timing and results of research and development efforts  including clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products  changes in third party reimbursement policies  the ability to execute  enforce and maintain license and collaborative agreements and attain the milestones under these agreements necessary to earn contract revenues  the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others  and the timing and amount of any repurchase of our stock or early retirement of our debt 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  this table should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations new corporate complex construction commitments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments to purchase components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products  and other recurring purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we have executed agreements to license technologies that are covered by the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the financial and commercial terms of each of these agreements vary significantly  and in virtually all cases our payment obligations under any individual agreement are not material to our business as a whole 
for the most part  the license agreements call for potential cash outflows for milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
the milestone payments under these agreements are primarily dependent on achieving product development goals  commencement of clinical studies of a product utilizing the licensed technology or meeting commercialization objectives  or any combination thereof 
examples of milestones for which we would make payments would include initiation of clinical studies of a potential product that is covered by the licensed technologies  fda clearance to market a product that is covered by the licensed technologies  and the first sale of a product that is covered by the licensed technologies in a specific territory 
the attainment of the milestones is highly uncertain and dependent upon many contingencies 
additionally  we exercise discretion whether to continue to utilize the licensed technologies 
at any time  we may  for technical or economic reasons  decide to discontinue utilizing the licensed technologies and would incur no further financial obligations beyond those payments already made 
as of december   there were no milestones  either individually or in the aggregate  under our licensing and collaborative agreements for which we believe material payments were required to be made  and  in the future  we believe that there are approximately  in payments that are reasonably likely to be made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
since  we have significantly expanded our direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  the united kingdom and italy  and we may expand into additional countries in the future 
sales and costs resulting from our direct sales and distribution operations in europe are denominated in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  we purchase our triage meterplus inventory from lre in euros  and we incur employee and other operating costs in foreign currencies 
as a result  our costs will fluctuate along with the currencies and general economic conditions in the countries in which we do business  which could harm our operating results 
in prior years  we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes and may do so in the future 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
we recognized a net currency exchange loss on foreign currency denominated transactions of  for compared to a net gain of  for significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our consolidated sales and earnings 
international sales and operations are also subject to a variety of other risks  including greater risk of uncollectible accounts  difficulty in staffing  monitoring and managing foreign operations  understanding of  and compliance with local employment laws  including reduced flexibility and increased cost of staffing adjustments  unknown or changes in regulatory practices  including import or export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs  employment and tax laws  adverse tax consequences  including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries  restrictions on repatriation of locally derived revenue  competition from locally produced products with cost advantages or national appeal  local business practices that could expose our direct sales and marketing organization to foreign corrupt practices act risks  political  social or economic conditions and changes in these foreign markets  and government spending patterns
