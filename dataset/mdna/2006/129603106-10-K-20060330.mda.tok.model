regulatory matters usa 
the company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to waterways and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials and is also subject to other federal and state laws regarding health and safety matters 
the company believes it is presently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are constantly evolving  and it is impossible to predict the effect these laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the us environmental protection agency epa has issued certain regulations under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra dealing with the transportation  storage and treatment of hazardous waste that impact the company in its carbon reactivation services 
when activated carbon supplied to a customer can no longer adsorb contaminants  it is returned to the company s facilities for reactivation and subsequent reuse 
if the substance s adsorbed by the spent carbon is are considered hazardous  under these epa regulations the activated carbon used in the treatment process is also considered hazardous 
therefore  a permit is required to transport the hazardous carbon to the company s facility for reactivation 
the company possesses the necessary federal and state permits to transport hazardous waste 
at the company s reactivation site  the hazardous spent activated carbon is placed in temporary storage tanks 
under the epa regulations  the company is required to have a hazardous waste storage permit 
the company has obtained rcra part b permits to store hazardous waste at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities 
the process of reactivating the spent activated carbon  which destroys the hazardous organic substances  is subject to permitting as a thermal treatment unit under rcra 
the company has filed for these permits at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities and is working toward obtaining the permits with the respective government agencies 
the company does not accept carbons containing certain hazardous materials for reactivation 
each of the company s domestic production facilities has permits and licenses regulating air emissions and water discharges 
all of the company s domestic production facilities are controlled under permits issued by local  state and federal air pollution control entities 
the company is presently in compliance with these permits 
continued compliance will require administrative control and will be subject to any new or additional standards 
in may  the company partially discontinued operation of one of its three activated carbon lines at its 
table of contents catlettsburg  kentucky facility 
the company will need to install pollution abatement equipment estimated at approximately million in order to remain in compliance with state requirements regulating air emissions before resuming full operation of this line 
management has not concluded its plan of action for compliance related to this activated carbon line  however  if it is determined that a shutdown of the full operation of the activated carbon line for other than a temporary period is warranted  the impact on current operating results would be insignificant 
in conjunction with the purchase of substantially all of waterlink s operating assets and the stock of waterlink s uk subsidiary  several environmental studies were performed on its columbus  ohio property by environmental consulting firms which identified and characterized areas of contamination 
in addition  these firms identified alternative methods of remediating the property  identified feasible alternatives and prepared cost evaluations of the various alternatives 
liability estimates are based on an evaluation of  among other factors  currently available facts  existing technology  laws  regulations  and the remediation experience of other companies 
the company has concluded from the information in the studies that a loss at this property is probable and has included an estimate of such loss of million  which was recorded as an undiscounted liability on the opening balance sheet at the date of the acquisition and was presented as a component of noncurrent other liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   and  the company had recorded an accrual of million 
the change in the accrual is a result of a decrease in estimated costs of million  which reduced the acquisition price of wsp  and the environmental remediation previously incurred of million for the year ended december  a change in the estimate of this obligation may occur as additional investigative work is performed and the remediation activity commences 
the ultimate remediation costs are dependent upon the extent and types of contamination  which will not be fully determined until more detailed information is developed through upcoming investigations and experience gained through remediation activities 
the accrued amounts are expected to be paid out over the course of several years 
the company has incurred  of environmental remediation expense for the year ended december  europe 
the company is also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations at its facilities in belgium  england and germany 
these laws and regulations address substantially the same issues as those applicable to the company in the united states 
the company believes it is presently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
indemnification 
the company has a limited indemnification agreement with the previous owner of the company which will fund certain environmental costs if they are incurred at the company s catlettsburg  kentucky plant 
the company believes that the amount of the indemnification is sufficient to fund these liabilities if they arise 
employee relations as of december   the company employed persons on a full time basis  of whom were salaried production  office  supervisory and sales personnel 
the hourly personnel in the united states are represented by the united steelworkers of america

risk factors failure to innovate new products or applications could adversely affect the company s ability to meet its strategic growth targets 
one of the ways that calgon carbon differentiates itself from its competition is through its technological superiority in helping customers to find solutions to their problems through the application of the company s products or services 
part of calgon carbon s strategic growth and profitability plans involve the development of new products or new applications for its current products in order to replace more mature products or markets that have seen increased competition 
if the company is unable to develop new products or applications then the company s financial results could be adversely affected 
calgon carbon holds a variety of patents that give the company a competitive advantage in certain markets 
an inability to defend those patents from competitive attack could have an adverse effect on both current results as well as future growth projections 
from time to time in the course of its business the company has to address competitive challenges to its patented technology 
calgon carbon is currently in litigation to defend its process patent for the use of ultraviolet light in the prevention of cryptosporidium infection in drinking water 
while the company believes it will prevail in this action  an unfavorable outcome of that patent defense would impair the company s ability to capitalize on substantial future revenues from the licensing of that technology 
delays in enactment of new state or federal regulations could restrict calgon carbon s ability to reach its strategic growth targets 
the company s strategic growth initiatives are reliant upon more restrictive environmental regulations being enacted for the purpose of making water and air cleaner and safer 
if stricter regulations are delayed or are not enacted  then the company s sales growth targets could be adversely affected 
calgon carbon s business includes capital equipment sales which could have extreme fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of that type of business 
calgon carbon s equipment segment approximated of the company s overall revenues in this business generally has a long project life cycle from bid solicitation to project completion and often requires customers to make large capital commitments well in advance of project execution 
in addition  this business is usually affected by the general health of the overall economy 
as a result  sales and earnings from the equipment segment could be volatile 
encroachment into calgon carbon s markets by competitive technologies could adversely affect financial results 
activated carbon is utilized in various applications as a cost effective solution for solving customer problems 
if other competitive technologies are advanced to the stage in which technologies could effectively compete with activated carbon costs and technologies  the company could experience a decline in sales and profitability 

table of contents increases in united states and european imports of chinese manufactured activated carbon could have an adverse effect on calgon carbon s financial results 
calgon carbon faces competition in its us and european markets from brokers of low cost imported activated carbon products  primarily from china 
this could include competition from foreign imports which could be deemed to be unfairly priced  otherwise known as dumped imports 
calgon carbon is currently a party to an anti dumping petition filed with the united states department of commerce and the united states international trade commission relating to imports of chinese carbon 
while the company believes it has a technically superior product  if imports increase and chinese products are accepted in more applications  the company could see declines in sales and profitability as it tries to remain competitive 
calgon carbon uses bituminous coal as the main raw material in its granular activated carbon production process 
an interruption of supply or an increase in coal prices could have an adverse effect on calgon carbon s financial results 
the company has various long term contracts in place for the supply of coal that expire at various intervals 
interruptions in coal supply caused by mine accidents  labor disputes  transportation delays  or other events for other than a temporary period could have an adverse effect on the company being able to meet its customer demand  in addition to increasing production costs 
calgon carbon s financial results could be adversely affected by shortages in natural gas supply or increases in natural gas prices 
calgon carbon utilizes natural gas as a key component in its activated carbon manufacturing process  and has long term contracts for the supply of natural gas at each of its major facilities 
if shortages of or restrictions on the delivery of natural gas occurs  production at the company s activated carbon facilities would be reduced which could result in missed deliveries or lost sales 
additionally  the company hedges its future supply of natural gas by purchasing forward contracts for up to two years in duration in order to limit prices fluctuations in the near term and smooth out the cost volatility 
these purchases however do not protect the company from longer term trends of rising natural gas prices which could result in significant production cost increases 
most of calgon carbon s hourly workforce is covered under union contracts  the company s inability to successfully negotiate contracts upon expiration could have an adverse affect on financial results 
the company has collective bargaining agreements in place at four of the company s production facilities covering approximately employees that expire from to any work stoppages as a result of disagreements with any of the labor unions or the failure to renegotiate any of the contracts as they expire could disrupt production and significantly increase product costs as a result of less efficient operations brought on by temporary labor 
an unplanned shutdown at one of the company s production facilities could have an adverse effect on financial results 
the company operates multiple facilities and sources product from strategic partners that operate facilities that are close to water or in areas susceptible to earthquakes 
an unplanned shutdown at any of the company s or its strategic partners facilities for more than a temporary period as a result of a labor dispute  hurricane  typhoon  earthquake or other natural disaster could significantly affect the company s ability to meet its demand requirements  thereby resulting in lost sales and profitability in the short term or eventual loss of customers in the long term 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
the company s production facilities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate or maintain properties 
costs may be incurred in complying with such laws and regulations if environmental remediation measures are required 
each of the company s domestic production facilities has permits and licenses regulating air emissions and water discharges 
all of the company s domestic production facilities are controlled under permits issued by local  state  and federal air pollution control entities 
international environmental requirements vary and could have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors a competitive advantage 
calgon carbon s international operations expose it to uncertainties and risks from abroad  which could negatively affect its results of operations 
the company has locations in europe  china  japan  and the 
table of contents united kingdom which are subject to economic conditions and political factors within the respective countries  which if changed could negatively affect the company s results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
calgon carbon has locations operating in multiple foreign countries and as a result is subject to foreign exchange translation risk which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
calgon carbon conducts business in the local currencies of each of its foreign subsidiaries or affiliates 
those results are then converted to us dollars at prevailing exchange rates and consolidated into the company s financial statements 
changes in exchange rates  particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  could significantly reduce the company s sales and profitability from foreign subsidiaries or affiliates from one period to the next as local currency amounts are translated into less us dollars 
the company does not hedge foreign translation risk 
calgon carbon s european and japanese activated carbon businesses are sourced from both the united states and china which subjects the company to foreign exchange translation risk 
calgon carbon s only source of production for virgin granular activated carbon is in the united states and china 
those facilities are used to supply all of the company s global demand of such product 
the company s foreign operations all purchase from the us operations in us dollars  yet sell in local currency  resulting in foreign exchange translation risk 
the company attempts to mitigate that risk in the short term by executing foreign currency derivative contracts of not more than one year in duration to cover its known or projected foreign currency exposure 
however  those contracts do not protect the company from longer term trends of a strengthening us dollar  which could significantly increase the company s cost of activated carbon delivered to its european and japanese markets and for which the company may not be able to offset by increases in its prices 
calgon carbon could find it difficult to fund the capital needed to complete its growth strategy due to borrowing restrictions under its us credit facility 
calgon carbon is extended credit under its us credit facility subject to compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company has had to amend its credit facility several times within the past year in order to cure violations or remain compliant as financial results have declined 
if the company s liquidity remains constrained for more than a temporary period the company may need to either delay certain strategic growth projects or access higher cost capital markets in order to fund the projects 
calgon carbon could be subject to significant increases in pension contributions to its defined benefit pension plans thereby restricting cash flow 
the company has made commitments to pay certain retirement benefits to its current and former employees under its defined benefit pension plans 
the funded status is determined using many assumptions such as inflation  investment rates  mortality  turnover  and discount rates which could turn out to be different than projected 
currently those plans in the aggregate are significantly under funded  and require a certain level of mandatory contributions as prescribed by law 
significant increases in the company s pension liabilities or decreases in pension assets as a result of actual experience being materially different than the projected assumptions would result in higher levels of mandatory contributions 
in addition  changes in pension legislation could also increase funding requirements which would have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and could restrict strategic investments 
calgon carbon has significant domestic and foreign net operating tax loss nol carryforwards which  if they are not utilized  would have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company has significant deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards that were generated from both the company s domestic and foreign operations 
the company has reduced that value of these assets by an appropriate valuation allowance for the amounts that are deemed not likely to be realized 
however if the company does not meet its projections of profitability in the future  some or all of those nol s could expire  which would result in a reduction of the company s deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense  and which would reduce the company s profitability 

table of contents calgon carbon faces risks in connection with the material weakness described in its sarbanes oxley section management report and any related remedial measures that the company undertakes 
in connection with the preparation of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   we concluded that the company s internal controls were ineffective as of december  as a result of the failure to record invoices for professional services in a timely manner 
we have initiated remediation measures to address the identified material weakness as described in part ii  item a  controls and procedures  and will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis  taking additional remedial action as appropriate 
if we are unable to effectively remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and to assert that disclosure controls and procedures including internal control over financial reporting are effective in any future period  the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on the company s stock price and potentially subject it to litigation 
provisions of delaware law and our rights plan may make a takeover of the company more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price
