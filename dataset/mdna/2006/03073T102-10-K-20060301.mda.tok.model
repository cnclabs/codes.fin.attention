item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip  familycare and snp 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
having concluded over ten years of operation  we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that significantly reduces medical cost trends and helps our state partners control their costs 
in  we increased our total revenues by over total membership increased by  members  or  to  members as of december our revenue growth came from a number of factors including organic growth our premium revenues for grew over the prior year from membership increases in existing service areas and new markets  including ohio and virginia  and premium rate increases received 
premium revenues benefited in from the reversal of a maryland premium recoupment previously recorded  totaling million  offset by million of anticipated premium recoupments related to enrollment errors by the states of florida and texas due to eligibility issues related to prior periods 
growth through acquisitions effective january   we completed our stock acquisition of careplus in new york city and putnam county  new york  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement 
at the date of the acquisition  careplus served approximately  members covered by new york state s medicaid  child health plus and family health plus programs 
careplus service areas include new york city brooklyn  manhattan  queens and staten island and putnam county  new york 
careplus accounted for of the premium revenue growth in as of december   more than of our current membership has resulted from ten acquisitions 
we are also focused on growth opportunities in new markets and new products 
we will continue to pursue opportunities that we believe meet our return metrics 
we continue to believe acquisitions will be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
in  our health benefits ratio hbr was versus in our results have been impacted by an increase in health benefits expense trend as evidenced by changes in membership  higher incidence of illness  obstetric services and related costs such as neonatal intensive care unit and other services  higher utilization and unit costs for network changes and provider contract rates and terms  as well as higher costs associated with entry into new markets 
in addition  due to the impact of the installation of our new claims processing system  facets  on october  in our texas market  we enhanced our medical claims estimation process during the fourth quarter of and added million to our claims payable balance to compensate for the reduction in the rate of claims processing 
we also added a separate factor for uncertainty of million to cover the impact of adverse changes in the level and nature of claims inventory associated with the conversion to facets 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to in the increase in the sg a ratio is primarily a result of increases in premium taxes  legal fees and experience rebate expenses 
cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million at the end of a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and investments is regulated by state capital requirements 
however  million of our cash  cash equivalents and investments was unregulated and held at the parent level 
on july   the state of texas released a request for proposal rfp to re procure its current medicaid managed care programs  as well as to expand the current programs 
in july  the state announced the results of this competitive bidding process as it relates to the tanf star and schip populations 
amerigroup s wholly owned subsidiary  amerigroup texas  inc was awarded star and schip  or texcare  contracts in its current service areas of houston  dallas and fort worth and contracts in two new service areas of corpus christi and el paso 
amerigroup texas  inc was also granted a star contract for the austin service area 
amerigroup texas  inc will have one or more competitors in each of its new and current service areas for the star and texcare programs 
the combined eligibles for these expanded products and markets are approximately  as compared to the previously existing eligible population of  in september  the company notified the state of texas that it had declined the contract award in el paso 
this decision was reached after the state of texas announced the results of the bid  which included re awarding contracts to the two existing managed care providers that currently serve approximately of the eligibles in this market 
this competitive environment would significantly limit market expansion opportunities 
implementation of the remaining contracts is expected to be in september these awards do not include the expansion of the star plus program 
the state announced expansion of star plus into all remaining urban areas under a modified structure which will exclude risk on hospitalization costs to protect the upper payment limit 
this may reduce premium levels compared to the current star plus reimbursement  but will be offset by an accompanied reduction in medical risk 
the revised program is expected to be finalized in and implemented by early we had an exclusive risk sharing arrangement with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc  that was terminated as of august  in its place  we entered into separate non exclusive fee for service provider agreements with ccpn and ccmc 
on december   ccpn and ccmc each sent notices indicating their intent to terminate these fee for service agreements as of march  we do not believe that such terminations are warranted under these agreements 
it is our intent to take appropriate actions to persuade ccpn and ccmc to rescind their notices of termination 
however  there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
ccpn and ccmc control most of the inpatient and specialty pediatric services available in fort worth  texas 
if these agreements terminate  it would force us to make alternate arrangements for many services to our pediatric membership  which may adversely impact our costs and our membership 
therefore  our results from operations could be harmed as a result of the termination of these arrangements  and the impact could be material 
as part of the state of texas re bidding process  cchcn obtained its own contract with the state of texas to provide healthcare services to medicaid recipients effective september  as a result  we may lose members based upon cchcn s contract with the state of texas  and the impact could be material 
in addition  under the risk sharing arrangement with cchcn that terminated as of august   the parties have an obligation to perform annual reconciliations and settlements of the risk pool for each contract year 
we believe that cchcn may owe us substantial payments for the and contract years  which we estimate at approximately million as of december  as of this date  we have not reached an agreement with cchcn as to the settlement amounts for the and contract years 
if we are unable to agree on a settlement  our health benefits expenses attributable to these periods may be adversely affected  and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to reach a final resolution of this matter 
we announced on june   that the state of illinois cut million from its fiscal year medicaid managed care budget 
the state of illinois decision to reduce spending on its medicaid managed care program caused amerigroup illinois  inc  to reduce its operations beginning with the third quarter of effective july   amerigroup illinois  inc entered into a new contract with the state of illinois that substantially reduced reimbursement for administrative  sales and marketing expenses and  accordingly  amerigroup illinois  inc  reduced the size of its organization 
the illinois legislature recently passed a bill proposed by the governor that would expand coverage for all uninsured children in illinois  using savings generated by imposing a statewide primary care case management program pccm 
this will allow the creation of a new entitlement with very limited controls on the growing costs of medicaid 
according to the state of illinois  the current hmo model would co exist and provide a choice for members 
this may limit growth opportunities for hmos and require us to reconsider our business strategy with respect to this market in the future 
amerigroup virginia  inc signed a contract with the commonwealth of virginia on july   and began enrolling members in september amerigroup ohio  inc also received an hmo license in and signed a contract with the state of ohio on july   and began enrolling members in september as a result of a competitive bidding process  our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc d b a amerigroup georgia  was chosen in july to offer healthcare coverage to low income residents in four of six regions in the state of georgia 
georgia will represent our entry into a tenth state 
amerigroup georgia will have two competitors in the atlanta region and one competitor in each of the other regions 
the total eligible members in all four regions are approximately  with  in the atlanta region 
we anticipate that amerigroup georgia will commence enrollment of members in the atlanta region on june  based on the most recent communication from the state 
on september   cms designated amerigroup texas  inc  as a special needs plan 
amerigroup texas  inc has entered into a contract with cms to offer medicare benefits to dual eligibles that live in and surrounding harris county  texas beginning january  amerigroup texas  inc already served these members through the texas medicaid star plus program and will offer them the medicare and part d drug benefit under this new contract 
as of january   we served approximately  members under this program 
in april  the maryland legislature enacted a budget for the fiscal year beginning july  that included a provision to reduce the premium paid to managed care organizations mcos that did not meet certain hedis scores and whose medical loss ratio was below for the calendar year ended december  in may  the maryland secretary of health and mental hygiene  in consultation with maryland s legislative leadership  determined our premium recoupment to be  a liability for the recoupment was recorded with a corresponding charge to premium revenue during the year ended december  additionally  the maryland legislature directed that the department of health and mental hygiene complete a study by september on the relevance of the medical loss ratio threshold as an indicator of quality 
the results of this study  which were released in october  did not directly address what would happen in the future if an mco reported a medical loss ratio below 
as a result  we believed the maryland legislature could enact similar legislation in as part of its fiscal year budget  requiring premium recoupment 
accordingly  we recorded a reduction in premium of million in our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december   which was our best estimate of the possible outcome of this issue 
the maryland legislative session ended on april  and it addressed the medical loss ratio assessment in the following manner 
first  no budget action was taken to recoup premium relating to as it did in the legislative session 
second  the maryland legislature amended the existing statute to clarify the process and required that regulations be promulgated by the department of health and mental hygiene before an action could be taken to recoup premium based upon an mco s medical loss ratio 
based on this information  we reversed the reduction in premium that was previously recorded resulting in million of additional premium revenue in the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health benefit services for our members 
in  we will receive premiums from cms for the snp program 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed premium per member per month is paid to us to arrange for healthcare benefit services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility determined by the state governments with which we have contracted 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative premium adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
in all of our states  except florida and virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborn obstetric deliveries 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to our contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for these services 
additionally  in some states we receive supplemental payments for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
any amounts that have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables 
we also generate income from investments 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits  as well as our ability to accurately predict costs incurred in recording the amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to health benefits have two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include fees paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  radiology  dental and vision 
medically related administrative costs include expenses related to services such as health promotion  quality assurance  case management  disease management and hour on call nurses 
direct medical expenses also include estimates of ibnr 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical payments related to fees paid on a fee for service basis to hospitals  pcps  specialist physicians and other providers  including fees paid to third party vendors for ancillary services 
the balance related to fees paid on a capitation  or per member  basis 
primary care and specialist physicians not paid on a capitation basis are paid on a maximum allowable fee schedule set forth in the contracts with our providers 
we reimburse hospitals on a negotiated per diem  case rate or an agreed upon percent of their standard charges 
in maryland  the state sets the amount reimbursed to hospitals 
fees paid for services provided to our members by hospitals and providers with whom we have no contract are paid based upon our usual and customary fee schedules unless mandated at other levels by state regulation 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical liabilities since our inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
as medical utilization patterns and cost trends change from year to year  our underlying claims payments reflect the variations in experience 
our estimates are revised based upon actual claims payments using historical per member per month claims cost  including provider settlements  changes in the age and gender of our membership  variations in the severity of medical conditions  high dollar claims and authorization data 
each of these factors may be considered in determining our current medical liabilities 
there are certain aspects of the managed care business that are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state eg  cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births  and the number of neonatal intensive care babies as well as non medical aspects  such as changes in provider contracting and contractual benefits 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix and growth of members 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  member mix changes  high dollar claims  and authorization data 
authorization data is information captured in our medical management system  which identifies services requested by providers or members 
the medical cost related to these authorizations is estimated by pricing the approved services using contractual or historical amounts adjusted for known variables such as historical claims trends 
these estimated costs are included as a component of ibnr in the more current months 
we enhanced our estimation processes in the fourth quarter of to reflect changes in claims payment patterns observed in and anticipated to continue in the future due to the conversion to the facets system 
we considered the typical reduction in the rate of claims processing due to a decrease in payment efficiencies associated with the installation of a new medical claims payment system 
as we have discussed previously  we transitioned our texas market  which represents of our membership  to facets effective october  to quantify the potential impact of this conversion on our three claims payment systems  we reviewed claims payments per member per month  by product and by health plan  and observed lower than historical payment patterns  while at the same time we saw an increase in claims inventory levels for certain markets 
accordingly  we estimated the value of the increase related to claims on hand at the end of the period and added million to our claims payable balance for this backlog in our ibnr estimate 
as part of our normal review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims  and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in claims payment patterns  membership  products and authorization trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustments are included in current operations 
due to the uncertainty associated with payment rates and inventory levels  associated with the facets conversion  we established a separate estimate for this uncertainty to cover the expected adverse claims development 
we will maintain this additional estimate as long as this uncertainty related to the systems conversion remains 
we utilize the services of independent actuarial consultants  who are contracted to review our estimates on a quarterly basis  as well as the assumptions used in forming these estimates 
judgments are made based on knowledge and experience about past and current events 
there is a likelihood that actual results could be materially different than reported if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
also included in claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to or from contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
during  we reclassified certain provider receivables under our risk sharing arrangement with cchcn to prepaid expenses  provider receivables and other current assets as a result of the termination of the contract whereby no liabilities remained in claims payable to offset the risk sharing receivable 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical claims payable for the years ended december   and in thousands medical claims payable as of january medical claims payable assumed from businesses acquired during the year health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december in the current year  we experienced a reduction in the favorable prior year development of approximately million related to and prior which compares to a decrease of million in the prior year related to and prior 
the current year reduction was primarily the result of continued tightening of our claims estimates at december  the company s methodology includes adding a factor to compensate for normal claims uncertainty 
the more precisely we have been able to predict claims patterns  the lower the required factor for uncertainty as a percentage of our medical liability 
due to the changing mix of members  products and markets  this factor is a necessary component of our medical liabilities 
while our prior year development historically has been favorable  there is no guarantee this will continue and the factor for uncertainty mitigates the risk of emerging claims experience that is different from historical patterns 
the health benefits expenses incurred during the period related to prior years relate almost entirely to revisions in estimates for the immediately preceding year 
the application of our methodology has resulted in reversals of estimated incurred claims related to prior years in each of the years in the three year period ended december  the resulting impact on operations is a function of the variation of the change in estimate from year to year 
included in the table above is the negative impact on earnings of the change in our factor for uncertainty of a total of million in this change was largely due to increased uncertainty around the conversion to our new claims system  facets  for which we have added a specific factor for uncertainty of million 
we will maintain this specific factor for claims uncertainty as long as the uncertainty related to the systems conversion remains 
we will review the progress of the systems conversion and will adjust the related factor for claims uncertainty as appropriate 
our unfavorable development of million compares to a favorable development of million in  and an unfavorable development of million in changes in estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
since our estimates are based upon the blended per member per month claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experience 
these variables include fluctuations in claims payment patterns  changes in membership levels  number and mix of products  benefit structure  changes in provider networks or contract terms  severity of illness and utilization levels 
we believe there will be less volatility as we increase in size and gain more maturity in our markets and successfully convert our remaining health plans to facets 
we believe that the amount of claims payable is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of claims payable and actual claims payable  net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted rates  including estimated tax rates in states where we do business  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and  we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we review our intangible assets with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future utility and cash flows and other internal and external factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
recent accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r applying the modified prospective method 
under sfas no 
r  the modified prospective method permits compensation cost to be recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r is estimated to be additional compensation cost of approximately million  net of tax  or per diluted share for the year ended december  this estimate could differ materially from actual compensation cost recognized as it depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of the standard for prior periods would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note i to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios for the years ended december   and all ratios  with the exception of the health benefits ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  premium revenue investment income total revenues health benefits selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income the health benefits ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium received and the health benefits provided 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of our members in each of our service areas for the periods presented 
december  market texas florida maryland new york new jersey illinois district of columbia ohio virginia total as of december   we served  members  which reflects an increase of  members compared to december  the careplus acquisition  effective january   added the new york market  which has grown to  members as of december  the remaining organic growth occurred in all of our other markets  except the district of columbia and florida  due to new product offerings  expansion into new service areas  successful marketing initiatives  and competitors leaving the market 
membership in the district of columbia remains constant 
the florida market decrease of  members is primarily the result of a decrease in the schip program  florida healthy kids 
this decrease is a direct result of changes made by the state of florida during in the eligibility re determination process and the frequency of member enrollment  both of which have negatively impacted the statewide membership in the florida healthy kids program 
the florida legislature enacted legislation in to address this problem  which was signed by the governor  increasing the frequency of the enrollment period from semi annual to monthly 
the state of florida is now in the process of implementing this enrollment change 
additionally  we have experienced a backlog in our texas enrollment due to the implementation of a new enrollment broker 
we anticipate  based on discussions with the state  that the issues that have caused this backlog will be corrected in and the enrollment backlog will be updated 
on december   we announced a two for one split of our common stock 
the stock split was in the form of a one hundred percent stock dividend of one share of common stock for every share of common stock issued and outstanding 
the stock dividend was distributed on january   to shareholders of record on december  all share and per share data described herein give retroactive effect to the two for one stock split effective january  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million in the increase was primarily due to internal growth in membership  growth through acquisition of careplus and premium rate increases 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  investment income increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase in investment income is primarily due to increases in market interest rates 
health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million for the year ended december  the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in our results have been impacted by an increase in membership  higher incidence of illness  an increase in obstetric services and related costs such as neonatal intensive care unit and other services  higher utilization and unit costs for network changes and provider contract rates and terms  as well as higher costs associated with entry into new markets 
in addition  due to the impact of the installation of our new claims processing system  facets  on october  in our texas market  we enhanced our medical claims estimation process during the fourth quarter of and added million to compensate for the reduction in the rate of claims processing 
we also added a separate factor for uncertainty of million to cover the impact of adverse changes in the level and nature of claims inventory associated with the conversion 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in sg a ratio was primarily due to an increase in premium taxes that the states of texas  new jersey and maryland began assessing in september  july  and april  respectively  an increase in legal expenses related to the tyson litigation and the securities class action complaints  and an increase in experience rebate expense in our texas market 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of as compared to the million for with an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in the blended state income tax rate reflecting the profitability by health plan 
net income net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in the decrease in net income is primarily a result of increased medical costs driven by higher incidence of illness  an increase in obstetric services and related costs such as neonatal intensive care unit and other services  higher utilization and unit costs for network changes and other new contract terms  as well as higher costs associated with entry into new markets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million in the increase was primarily due to internal growth in membership as well as premium rate increases 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  investment income increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase in investment income is primarily due to increased levels of cash and investments that were a result of having the proceeds from the secondary offering that occurred in october available for a full year of investing in and cash generated from operations  as well as increases in market interest rates and a shift in our investment portfolio toward longer term investments with higher yields 
health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in membership 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in hbr is driven by less favorable development than in the prior year due to a combination of more mature claims patterns in existing products and markets offset by increased leverage of premium revenue 
this had the effect of increasing the current year hbr even though there was no increase in our core medical run rates 
the underlying medical performance continues to be stable with trend patterns consistent with those of the prior year  except for more moderate seasonal respiratory disorders than in the prior year and continued elevated obstetric services 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the net increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in premium taxes that the states of texas and new jersey began assessing in september and july  respectively  a decrease in purchased services related to strategic initiatives in for operational improvements  including expenses related to the implementation of the hipaa guidelines  and a decrease in experience rebate expense in our texas market 
our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in this improvement was achieved due to increased leverage of premium revenue from successful rate increases and increased membership levels 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease primarily relates to the repayment of our outstanding balance of our credit facility on october   with a portion of the net proceeds from our october  public offering 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of as compared to the million for with an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  an increase in investments in tax advantaged securities and the resolution of potential tax issues from a prior year 
net income net income for rose million to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in diluted earnings per share rose as compared to an increase in net income of due to the increase in shares outstanding primarily resulting from the issuance of  shares from our october  public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
unregulated cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaled million at december  on may   we entered into an amendment amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement  which  among other things  provides for an increase in the commitments under our credit agreement then in existence to million and a five year extension of the term from the date of the amendment 
the credit agreement contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million 
the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  permitted acquisitions of businesses  assets and technologies 
the borrowings under the credit agreement will accrue interest at one of the following rates  at our option eurodollar plus the applicable margin or an alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for eurodollar borrowings is between and and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings is between and 
the applicable margin will vary depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  php holdings  inc  including the stock of their respective wholly owned managed care subsidiaries 
there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement that ranges from to  depending on the leverage ratio 
the credit agreement terminates on may  as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement we must meet certain financial covenants 
these financial covenants include meeting certain financial ratios and a limit on capital expenditures and repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
on may   our shelf registration statement was declared effective with the sec covering the issuance of up to million of securities including common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
under this shelf registration  we may publicly offer such registered securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  including an over allotment issuance of  shares 
net proceeds from the offering  after fees and expenses  were approximately million 
on october   we used million of proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
the balance of approximately million was used to partially fund the careplus acquisition effective january  effective january   we completed our stock acquisition of careplus in new york city  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement entered into on october  for million in cash  including acquisition costs 
on june   and december   additional consideration of million and million was paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement

the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily related to reductions in cash out flows from bank overdrafts offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by various jurisdictions  including the departments of insurance in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we anticipate the parent company will be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe as a result that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements for the next months 
we believe that internally generated funds and available funds under our credit agreement will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months

upon qualifying for such grants  the company is obligated to advance the funds to be received under the grant to the landlord  unless previously reimbursed by the company 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos  one mco and one phsp 
hmos  mcos  and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we anticipate the parent company will be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe as a result that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the recommended minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage that are designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
at december   the rbc ratio of each of the company s health plans was at or above the level that would require regulatory action 
although not all states had adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of the company s active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation are appropriate  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 
our independent actuaries estimate our health benefits expense trend increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  to be approximately normalized for underlying membership and product changes 
we anticipate our health benefits expense trend increase to be approximately 
our inability to reduce the gap through operational improvements between expected rate increases of approximately and this expected health benefits expense trend could significantly impact our results of operations in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements at december  include future minimum rental commitments of million and capital improvement obligations of million 
we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million  long term investments of million and investments on deposit for licensure of million 
these investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities between three months and eight years 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
credit risk is managed by investing in commercial paper  money market funds  us treasury securities  asset backed securities  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
our investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and our cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
we have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change in our annual investment income or per share change in diluted earnings per share
