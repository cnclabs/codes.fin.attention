item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements and notes presented under item reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three components property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain other activities of ventures as described herein 
our reinsurance operations are managed by the president of renaissance reinsurance  who leads a team of underwriters  risk modelers and other industry professionals  who have access to our proprietary risk management  underwriting and modeling resources and tools 
we believe the expertise of our underwriting and modeling team and our proprietary analytic tools  together with superior customer service  provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business  although no current relationship exceeds of our gross written premiums 
accordingly  our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
the following table shows our total managed catastrophe and specialty reinsurance gross premiums written

in addition to the gaap financial measures set forth in this form k  we have included certain non gaap financial measures in this form k within the meaning of regulation g 
we have consistently provided these financial measurements in previous filings and we believe that these measurements are important to investors and other interested parties  and that investors and other such persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
these measures may not  however  be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside the insurance industry 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non gaap measures in assessing our overall financial performance 
we have included in this form k managed property catastrophe premiums and managed reinsurance premiums 
managed property catastrophe premiums and managed reinsurance premiums are defined as gross property catastrophe and gross reinsurance premiums  respectively  written by renaissance reinsurance and our joint ventures 
managed property catastrophe premiums and managed reinsurance premiums differ from total property catastrophe premiums and total reinsurance premiums  respectively  which we believe are the most directly comparable gaap measures  due to the inclusion of catastrophe premiums written on behalf of our joint venture top layer re which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
property catastrophe reinsurance we believe we are the one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  based on managed catastrophe gross premiums written 
our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
we offer our coverages on a worldwide basis 
because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  including the size of such events and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations may reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
we seek to moderate the volatility described in the preceding paragraph through superior risk selection and portfolio diversification 
we may opportunistically increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk adjusted pricing adequacy 
also  we may seek to purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of frequent and numerous catastrophes could have on our results 
as a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer service  we believe we have superior access to desirable business compared to the market as a whole 
as described above  we use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities 
we dynamically model policy submissions against our current in force portfolio  comparing the expected profit of the contract against the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall portfolio risk 
at times  our approach to portfolio management may result in our having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region where we believe pricing is attractive  or  in contrast  a disproportionately low market share in regions where we believe pricing is inadequate 
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we principally write catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  which means we provide coverage to our insureds when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
in addition  the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance other than property catastrophe  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  certain casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
as with our catastrophe business  our team of experienced professionals seek to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools 
we believe that our underwriting and analytic capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 
we generally seek to target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and will opportunistically write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance products  and also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
the reinsurer pays the cedant a commission which is generally based on the cedant s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured including commissions  premium taxes  assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses and may also include a profit factor 
our products generally include numerous tailored features  and typically have liability limits  sub limits  corridors or other features which we believe help us manage our exposures 
any liability exceeding or otherwise not subject to such limits reverts to the cedant 
as with our catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 
we generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties 
as a result of our financial strength  we have the ability to offer significant capacity and  for select risks  we have made available limits of up to million per program 
we believe these capabilities  the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team  and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business 
ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
property catastrophe managed joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with an additional presence in the market as well as fee income 
they allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
currently  our joint ventures include top layer re and davinci 
we are the exclusive underwriting manager for each of top layer re and davinci 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by renaissance reinsurance 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
we account for top layer re under the equity method and our proportionate share of its results are reflected in equity in earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statement of operations 
davinci writes global reinsurance 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we also write certain lines of specialty reinsurance for davinci  currently terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers compensation 
in the fourth quarter of davincire holdings ltd 
davincire  davinci s parent company  raised million of equity capital and an additional million was raised in february the capital was funded by new and existing investors  including million contributed by us 
our ownership in davincire was at december   down from prior to the capital raise 
as of february   our ownership in davincire was 
we continue to maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  will continue consolidating the results of davincire into our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in these joint ventures  we typically provide our partners with underwriting  claims management  risk modeling  capital and investment management services  marketing  reporting  remittances and payments processing and other services 
we work within agreed upon underwriting guidelines  using the same techniques and systems for the underwriting as we apply to our own portfolio 
these relationships generate fees for services and profit sharing income for us 
in turn  our joint ventures have increased the capital we can commit to the catastrophe reinsurance market and have deepened our market penetration 
customized reinsurance transactions 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated in the market for catastrophe linked securities 
we also offer products through which we cede participations in the performance of our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management objectives 
business development joint ventures and other investments 
ventures also pursues other types of investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
examples of these investments include

other investments and initiatives including ventures focused on trading weather sensitive commodities  securities and derivatives 
only business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of our investments in top layer re  channel re  platinum and other ventures are included in the other category of our segment results 
competition we believe that our principal competitors in our reinsurance segment include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace limited  allied world assurance company  arch capital group arch  axis capital holdings  endurance specialty holdings ltd  everest re group ltd  ipc holdings  ltd  montpelier re holdings  partnerre ltd  platinum and xl capital ltd 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as american international group  inc aig  berkshire hathaway berkshire  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
following hurricane katrina in august  a significant trend of new company formation focused in bermuda commenced  which may result in substantial new competition for and subsequent periods 
we believe there has been at least billion of new capital that has been contributed to these new bermuda based reinsurance enterprises 
in addition  we believe existing reinsurance companies have raised in excess of billion of new capital subsequent to hurricane katrina to rebuild their capital position and to capitalize on new opportunities 
also  hedge funds have shown increasing interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products 
over the last several years capital markets participants  including exchanges and financial intermediaries  have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
although the impact of these financial products to date has been limited  it could grow in the future 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our clients operate can affect demand for reinsurance 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks which may be available for us when considering to offer coverage 
individual risk segment since  we have significantly increased the amount of capital and resources devoted to our individual risk segment 
our gross premiums written in this segment have grown from million in to million in  and we expect the growth to continue in  although at a reduced rate of increase

we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment is managed by the chief executive officer of the glencoe group 
our individual risk operations seek on an opportunistic basis to identify and write classes of business which are attractively priced relative to the risk exposure and  in the case of catastrophe exposed risks  where our expertise in modeling  analytical tools and information systems may provide a competitive advantage 
our individual risk business is written by the glencoe group through its operating subsidiaries glencoe and lantana  on an excess and surplus lines basis  and by stonington and stonington lloyds  on an admitted basis 
our principal contracts include insurance contracts and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including commercial and homeowners property coverages  including catastrophe exposed products  commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile  professional and various specialty products  multi peril crop insurance  and reinsurance of other insurers on a quota share basis

we seek to identify and do business with program managers and quota share reinsurance cedants whom we believe utilize superior underwriting methodologies 
we rely on these third parties for services including policy issuance  premium collection  claims processing  and compliance with various state laws and regulations including licensing 
we seek to work closely with these partners  attempting to employ our analytical methodologies and  where appropriate  our expertise in catastrophe risk  to arrive at adequate pricing for the risks being underwritten 
we seek to structure these relationships to provide value to both parties and meaningful protections to us 
our strategy is to pursue a relatively small number of relatively large relationships 
we also purchase excess of loss reinsurance to reduce the impact of catastrophic losses 
we actively oversee our third party relationships through an operations review team at glencoe group services and through the use of our proprietary program analytical central repository  pacer 
the operations review team utilizes professionals in the disciplines of actuarial science  accounting  claims management  law  regulatory compliance and underwriting 
this group assists with the initial due diligence as well as the ongoing monitoring of these third parties 
the ongoing monitoring includes periodic audits of our program managers and third party administrators 
in addition  for our large program managers we maintain an employee in an underwriting capacity on site at the program manager to oversee the program manager s compliance with our prescribed underwriting guidelines 
we generally seek to have contractual performance standards for each of our programs and third party claims administrators whose compensation is subject to adjustment based on meeting these standards 
the program operations team audits compliance with our underwriting guidelines and contractually agreed operating guidelines and performance standards 
the program operations team actively works with our third parties to ensure corrective action is taken quickly to resolve issues identified during the audit process 
we operate through the glencoe group of companies  whose principal operating subsidiaries are glencoe  stonington  lantana  stonington lloyds insurance company stonington lloyds  newstead insurance company newstead and inverness insurance company inverness 
glencoe is a bermuda domiciled excess and surplus lines insurance company and is currently eligible to do business on an excess and surplus lines basis in us jurisdictions 
stonington  a texas domiciled insurance company  is licensed on an admitted basis in all states and the district of columbia 
lantana is a bermuda domiciled insurance company currently eligible as an excess and surplus lines carrier in us jurisdictions 
newstead and inverness are delaware and arizona domiciled insurance companies  respectively  and each is currently licensed on an admitted basis in its state of domicile 
competition 
in our individual risk business  we face competition from independent insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of major worldwide companies and others  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
primary insurers compete on the basis of various factors including distribution channels  product  price  service  financial strength and reputation 
many of our reinsurance segment competitors listed above also compete for the program business and quota share reinsurance we write within our individual risk segment 
we believe that our principal competitors in the program business of our individual risk segment include operating subsidiaries of aig  arch  wr berkley corp 
berkley  berkshire  hannover re and zurich financial services group zurich 
ratings over the last five years  we have received high claims paying and financial strength ratings from s p  am best and moody s

renaissance reinsurance was downgraded from a and renaissancere was downgraded from a on november  s p 
the aa range aa  aa  aa  which has been assigned by s p to top layer re  is the second highest rating assigned by s p  and indicates that s p believes the insurer s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the a range a  a and a is the third highest of four ratings ranges within what s p considers the secure category 
an insurer rated a is believed by s p to have strong financial security characteristics  but to be somewhat more likely to be affected by business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
am best 
a is the second highest designation of am best s sixteen rating levels 
a rated insurance companies are defined as superior companies and are considered by am best to have a very strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
a and a are the third and fourth highest designations  respectively  assigned by am best  representing am best s opinion that the insurer has an excellent ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
am best also assigns a financial size category to each of the insurance companies rated 
vii represents a company with million in capital  ix represents a company with million in capital  x represents a company with million in capital and xiii represents a company with billion in capital 
moody s 
moody s insurance financial strength ratings and moody s credit ratings represent its opinions of the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually policyholder claims and obligations and senior unsecured debt instruments 
moody s believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  and companies rated baa  such as renaissancere  offer good financial security 
however  moody s believes that elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
in november  following our announcement that our then chairman and ceo resigned from the company in light of the ongoing investigations resulting from the company s restatement of its financial results  and our announcement that our chief operating officer and chief financial officer john m 
lummis intends to retire at the end of his contract term on june   as discussed herein under part ii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current outlook  i standard poor s ratings services removed from credit watch and lowered its counterparty credit and senior debt ratings on the company to a from a  the preferred stock ratings on the company to bbb from bbb  and the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on renaissance reinsurance to a from aa  and also removed from credit watch and affirmed its a counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on davinci  ii moody s investors service inc lowered its senior debt rating on the company to baa from a  the insurance financial strength rating of renaissance reinsurance to a from a  the rating of the capital securities issued by renaissancere capital trust to baa from baa  and the capital securities rating of renaissancere capital trust ii to p baa from p baa  and also lowered the ratings for the company s junior subordinated debt to baa from baa  the preference stock to baa from baa  the provisional senior unsecured debt to p baa from p a  the provisional subordinated debt to p baa from p baa  and the provisional preference stock to p baa from p baa  iii fitch ratings ltd 
downgraded the long term rating of the company to bbb from a  the rating on the company s senior unsecured notes to bbb from a  the rating on the company s preferred stock to bbb from bbb  and the insurer financial strength rating on renaissance reinsurance to a from a  and also removed these ratings from rating watch negative and announced the rating outlook is negative  and iv am best company  inc downgraded the financial strength rating of renaissance reinsurance to a from a  the financial strength ratings of the operating subsidiaries of glencoe group to a from a  the financial strength ratings of the operating subsidiaries of overseas partners cat limited to a from a  the issuer credit rating of davinci to a from a  and the issuer credit rating of the company to bbb from a and also downgraded the company s debt ratings  and announced its ratings remain under review with negative implications 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance remain among the highest in our business  these ratings actions could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a further downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
underwriting reinsurance our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance contracts that maximizes our return on shareholders equity  subject to prudent risk constraints  and generate long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends 
we assess each new reinsurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 
we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
rems was initially developed with consulting assistance from tillinghast  an actuarial consulting unit of towers  perrin  forster crosby  and applied insurance research  inc  the developer of the catmap system 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting experience  additional proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss which the program presents 
we have licensed and integrated into rems a number of third party catastrophe computer models in addition to our base model  which we use to validate and stress test our base rems results 
rems is most developed in analyzing catastrophe risks 
our tools for assessing non catastrophe risks are much less sophisticated and much less well developed than those for catastrophe risks 
we are working to better develop our analytical techniques relating to non catastrophe risks 
we believe that rems is a more robust underwriting and risk management system than is currently commercially available elsewhere in the reinsurance industry 
before the company binds a risk  a significant amount of exposure data is typically gathered from clients and this exposure data is input into the rems modeling system 
the rems modeling system enables the company to measure each policy on a consistent basis and provides the company with a measurement of an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
our models employ simulation techniques to generate  years of activity  including events causing in excess of billion in insured industry losses 
from this simulation  we generate estimates of expected claims  expected profits and a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each program in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
rems allows us to score the contracts that we write by comparing the expected profit of a contract with the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract based on its marginal impact on the risk of our portfolio 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that are not captured in the commercially available models 
we periodically review our catastrophe assumptions in rems 
we have had an ongoing review of our atlantic hurricane model for the past two years  and in the second half of we decided to revise our assumptions around atlantic basin hurricane frequency and severity 
most commercial catastrophe models base their frequency and severity distributions on the last years of hurricane activity 
these commercial models assume that a long term view of hurricane risk is appropriate for the insurance industry 
based on our review of the scientific literature  private research  and discussions with some of the leading climatologists and meteorologists  we do not currently believe the past years of data is reflective of current activity 
we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that develop in the atlantic basin and that have the potential to make landfall in the us we started using these revised assumptions in rems to model and evaluate our portfolio of risk in the latter part of these assumptions involve significant judgment on our part  and further experience or scientific research may lead us to further adjust these assumptions 
our catastrophe reinsurance underwriters use rems in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability

to provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
we have developed underwriting guidelines  to be used in conjunction with rems  that seek to limit the exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including

the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant

in order to define the risk profile of each line of specialty reinsurance  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation  we are leveraging directly off our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and it is important to understand the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  which have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and hence have significantly less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  probability distributions are derived from a variety of underlying information  including recent historical experience  but with the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use on our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our underlying risks  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions  and manage our total risk portfolio 
overall we undertake to construct conservative representations of the risks within our models  although there can be no assurance that this has occurred 
individual risk for our catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we are seeking to utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations  as described above 
we also combine these analyses with those of our reinsurance segment to monitor our aggregate group catastrophic exposures 
in general  our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are much better developed than those for other classes of risk 
for the business produced through program managers  we seek to carefully identify and evaluate potential program managers 
when evaluating a potential new program manager  we consider numerous factors including i whether the program manager can provide and help us analyze historic loss and other business data  ii whether the program manager will agree to accept a portion of their compensation based on the underwriting performance of their program and provide us with the other terms and conditions we require  iii the integrity and experience of the program manager s management team  iv the potential profitability of the program to us  and v the availability of our internal resources to appropriately conduct due diligence  negotiate and execute transaction terms  and provide the ongoing monitoring we require 
in considering pricing for the products to be offered by the program manager  we evaluate the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing the necessary coverage including the cost of administering policy benefits  sales and other administrative and overhead costs and an anticipated margin for profit 
in addition to utilizing rems  within our individual risk operations we have developed a proprietary program analytical repository  pacer  within which we intend to maintain all of our program business 
we are developing statistical and analytical techniques to help evaluate the lines of business we write within this segment and which over time we hope will create a competitive advantage 
we also believe that pacer helps our clients better understand their business  thus creating value for them and us 
for example  pacer enables us to better identify and estimate the expected loss experience of particular products and is employed in the design of our products and the establishment of rates 
we also seek to monitor pricing adequacy on our products by region  risk and producer 
subject to regulatory considerations  we seek to make timely premium and coverage modifications where we determine them to be appropriate 
we provide our program managers with written underwriting guidelines and monitor their compliance with our guidelines on a regular basis 
also  our contracts generally provide that a portion of the commission payable to our program managers will be on a retrospective basis  which is intended to permit us to adjust commissions based on our profitability and claims experience once an underwriting year is reasonably mature 
we rely on our program managers to perform underwriting pursuant to these contractual guidelines  and believe we benefit from their superior local information and expertise in niche areas 
geographic breakdown our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones  but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities

the category individual risk consists of contracts that are primarily exposed to us risks 
reserves for claims and claim expenses reserves for claims and claim expenses represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of an insurer s or reinsurer s expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation 
it is likely that our ultimate liability in respect of these reserves will exceed or be less than our current estimates  possibly materially 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance operations  we initially set our reserves for claims and claim expenses based on case reserves and other reserve estimates reported by insureds and ceding companies 
we then add to these claims reserves  our estimates for additional case reserves and an estimate for incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
these estimates are normally based upon our experience with similar claims  our knowledge of potential industry loss levels for each loss  and industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we currently do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
currently we estimate our ibnr reserves for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages by utilizing an actuarial method known as the bornhuetter ferguson technique 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson technique requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an estimated loss reporting pattern for each line of business that we offer 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the coverages and terms of coverages that we offer 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and since there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
in response to these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable adjustments to our reserves  principally relating to catastrophe exposed coverages 
in future periods  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that such reductions will occur 
with the growth in our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we announced in early that we would review the processes and assumptions for establishing and evaluating our reserves 
we completed reviews of our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves  specialty reinsurance reserves and individual risk reserves in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced prior year reserves within our reinsurance and individual risk segments by million and million  respectively 
after adjusting for the impact of minority interest  our net loss was reduced by million as a result of these reviews 
the reserve reviews described above reflected updated assumptions  new information received to date and procedural enhancements to the company s reserving process 
within our reinsurance segment  the reserve changes for our property catastrophe portfolio reflects a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for our specialty reinsurance business  the changes were principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore we have adjusted our estimated loss reporting patterns to reflect this experience 
the changes within our individual risk segment as a result of the reserve review were insignificant 
all of our estimates are reviewed annually with an independent actuarial firm 
we also review certain assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
although we believe that we are prudent in our assumptions  and in the application of our methodologies  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  perhaps materially  from the estimates we have made 
adjustments to our claims reserves will increase current year net earnings if our current estimates of prior year claims reserves are lower than the initial estimates or will decrease net earnings if our current estimates of prior year claims reserves are greater than the initial estimates 
we incurred net claims of  million   million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our total gross reserves for claims and claim expenses were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the following table represents the development of our us generally accepted accounting principles gaap balance sheet reserves for through december  this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
the top line of the table shows the gross reserves for claims and claim expenses at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amounts of claims and claim expenses arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including additional case reserves and ibnr reserves 
the table also shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency on net reserves represents the aggregate change to date from the indicated estimate of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses  net of losses recoverable on the second line of the table 
the table also shows the cumulative net paid amounts as of successive years with respect to the net reserve liability 
at the bottom of the table is a reconciliation of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses to the net reserve for claims and claim expenses  the gross re estimated liability to the net re estimated liability for claims and claim expenses  and the cumulative redundancy deficiency on gross reserves 
with respect to the information in the table below  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods  including the effect of foreign exchange rates

our largest product has historically been property catastrophe reinsurance where we have exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes and other natural and man made disasters  such as terrorism 
the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and since there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
therefore  in response to these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable adjustments to our reserves  principally relating to catastrophe exposed coverages and coverages within our specialty reinsurance business unit 
in future periods  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that such reductions will occur 
the following table presents an analysis of our paid  unpaid and incurred losses and loss expenses and a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for claims and claims expenses for the years indicated

at december   the prior year favorable development of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate claims reserves was primarily due to the reinsurance and individual risk reserve reviews we undertook during the year  which produced a reduction of million in the reinsurance segment and million in the individual risk segment 
within the reinsurance segment  our property catastrophe portfolio experienced a million reduction in prior year reserves as a result of the reserve review 
this reduction reflected a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for the specialty reinsurance business  the million reduction in prior year reserves was principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore the company has adjusted its estimated loss reporting patterns to reflect this experience 
the changes within the individual risk segment as a result of the reserve review were insignificant 
at december   the prior year favorable reserve development of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate claims reserves in our reinsurance segment was primarily due to a re estimation of our ultimate losses associated with six large catastrophe events  which produced a reduction of approximately million  a million reduction in reserves from numerous smaller catastrophe events and million in reductions from our specialty reinsurance book of business 
the reductions in our reserves for the smaller catastrophe events  the reduction in reserves for our specialty reinsurance book of business and the reserves for our individual risk segment were driven by the application of our formulaic methodology used for these books of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
at december   the prior year net favorable reserve development in of million was primarily due to favorable reserve development of million in our reinsurance segment and million in our individual risk segment 
within the reinsurance segment our property catastrophe line of business recorded million in favorable reserve development 
this was driven by reductions in the estimated losses on relatively small catastrophes for the through accident years 
the largest net favorable reserve development on a single event was million which related to the reduction in the estimate of the ultimate cost to settle net claims arising from the european floods of our specialty reinsurance line of business within the reinsurance segment had favorable reserve development of million in which was principally driven by reductions from the accident year 
our individual risk segment had favorable reserve development of million in which was driven by favorable reserve development in the accident year associated with the company s bermuda based property business 
net claims and claim expenses incurred were reduced by million during million  million related to income earned on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with underwriting risk only 
other income was increased by million during reduced by million  nil related to losses incurred on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with timing risk only and premiums ceded on reinsurance contracts classified as derivatives under gaap 
aggregate deposit liabilities of million are included in reinsurance balances payable at december  million and aggregate deposit assets of million are included in other assets at december  million

at december   we held investments totaling billion  compared to billion at december   with net unrealized appreciation included in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december   compared to million at december  our investment guidelines  which are approved by our board  stress preservation of capital  market liquidity  and diversification of risk 
notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities  however  over the last several years we have increased our exposure to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships and other investments 
during we decreased our allocation to these other investments 
at december  these other investments totaled million or million or of our total investments 
at december  our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or of our fixed maturity investments available for sale  and at december  our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or of our total fixed maturity investments available for sale 
in addition  within our other investments category we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities 
at december  the funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities totaled million compared to million at december  at december   our fixed maturities available for sale and short term investment portfolio had a dollar weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa 
at december   our average yield to maturity on our fixed maturity investments available for sale and our short term investment portfolio was  before investment expenses 
our target portfolio currently has a duration of approximately years for our fixed maturities and short term investments 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk associated with longer duration 
from time to time  we may reevaluate our duration in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include

spacer 
gif 
changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will normally be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment

our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective 
the following table summarizes the fair value by contractual maturity of our fixed maturity investment portfolio available for sale at the dates indicated 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty

the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these investments is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
net investment income includes interest income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees 
the amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity investments is computed using the effective yield method 
the fair values of our fixed maturity investments are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications and or internal pricing valuation techniques 
realized gains or losses on the sale of fixed maturity investments are determined using the average cost method and include adjustments to the cost for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
the company routinely assesses whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments below cost represent impairments that are considered other than temporary 
there are several factors that are considered in the assessment of impairment of a security  which include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii the company s intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
where the company has determined that there is an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the security  the cost of the security is written down to its fair value and the unrealized loss at the time of the determination is charged to income 
the following table presents an analysis of the continuous periods during which the company has held fixed maturity investment positions which were carried at an unrealized loss as of december  and

during the year ended december   the company recorded million million  million in other than temporary impairment charges 
the significant increase in other than temporary impairment charges in was due to our decision to recognize impairment charges for all of our fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position as of december  as we do not currently have the intent to hold them until they fully recover in value 
this accounting is consistent with the guidance provided by the financial accountings standards board fasb in fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which was issued in the fourth quarter of rising interest rates during gave rise to a higher level of unrealized losses at december  compared to december   prior to our other than temporary impairment charge 
other than temporary impairment charges are recorded as net realized losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
credit related impairment charges in our fixed maturity investments available for sale were million in other investments the table below shows our portfolio of other investments

the fair value of certain of our other investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag

marketing reinsurance we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  and the risk management advice that we provide to our clients  has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through reinsurance brokers

we believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and  therefore  we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and clients 
we target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business 
we believe that primary insurers and brokers willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing  but also on the financial security of the reinsurer  its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to pay valid claims  the quality of a reinsurer s service  the reinsurer s willingness to design customized programs  its long term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance capacity 
we believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and clients for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  we can establish reinsurance terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on catastrophe risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and clients 
our reinsurance brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our reinsurance products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
in recent years  our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small number of such relationships

the business produced through program managers  quota share reinsurance and broker produced business principally comes to us through intermediaries 
our financial security ratings  combined with our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace  including the long standing relationships we have developed with our reinsurance intermediaries  have enhanced our presence in the individual risk markets 
with respect to our program business  we believe that our strategy of establishing strong relationships and assisting our partners with modeling  risk analysis and other expertise is helping us to develop a favorable reputation in this market 
we believe that our existing program managers are an important source of referrals and endorsements of our unique approach 
our broker produced business is principally business written on an excess and surplus lines basis by glencoe and lantana on a risk by risk basis 
this business is generally submitted to us through licensed surplus lines brokers who are generally responsible for regulatory compliance  premium tax collection and certain other matters associated with policy placement 
employees at february   we and our subsidiaries employed people 
we believe that our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries 
a majority of our employees and all of our directors receive some form of equity based incentive compensation as part of their overall compensation package 
at february   our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common shares 
in addition  all of our directors and executive officers are subject to stock ownership guidelines that require each to hold a specified amount of stock 
many of our bermuda based employees  including a majority of our senior executives  are employed pursuant to work permits granted by the bermuda authorities 
these permits expire at various times over the next few years 
bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions for key employees 
a majority of our senior executives are subject to employment agreements providing for  among other things  confidentiality  non solicitation and non competition obligations on the part of the executives  and provisions relating to our indemnification and severance obligations 
regulation bermuda regulation registration 
the insurance act  as amended  and related regulations the insurance act  which regulates the business of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries  provides that no person may carry on an insurance business including the business of reinsurance in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the insurance act by the bermuda monetary authority the bma 
renaissance reinsurance and davinci are registered as class insurers  and glencoe  lantana and top layer re are registered as class insurers under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the bma is required by the insurance act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and  in particular  whether it has  or has available to it  adequate knowledge and expertise 
in connection with the applicant s registration  the bma may impose conditions relating to the writing of certain types of insurance 
further  the insurance act stipulates that no person shall  in or from within bermuda  act as an insurance manager  broker  agent or salesman unless registered for the purpose by the bma 
ventures is registered as an insurance manager under the insurance act 
an insurance advisory committee appointed by the bermuda minister of finance the minister advises the bma on matters connected with the discharge of its functions  and sub committees thereof supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in bermuda  including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures 
the insurance act imposes on bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants to the bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
cancellation of insurer s registration 
an insurer s registration may be canceled by the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with a requirement made of it under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma  after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
independent approved auditor 
every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of each of a class insurer and a class insurer  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
the auditor must be approved by the bma as the independent auditor of the insurer 
if the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor  the bma may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor within fourteen days  if not agreed sooner by the insurer and the auditor 
the approved auditor may be the same person or firm which audits the insurer s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist 
each class and class insurer is required to submit an annual loss reserve opinion on the adequacy of the loss and loss expense provisions reflected in an insurer s statutory financial statements and statutory financial return and other matters required by the bma when filing the annual statutory financial return 
this opinion must be issued by the insurer s approved loss reserve specialist 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
statutory financial statements 
an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of such statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  income statement  and a statement of capital and surplus  and detailed notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act of bermuda  as amended the companies act  which financial statements may be prepared in accordance with gaap 
the insurer is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions 
the insurance act provides that the statutory assets of an insurer must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin which varies with the type of registration of the insurer under the insurance act and the insurer s net premiums written and loss reserve level 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer with respect to its general business is the greatest of million  of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums and of loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer with respect to its general business is the greater of million or of the first million of net premiums written  if in excess of million  the figure shall be million plus of net premiums written in excess of million 
the insurance act mandates certain actions and filings with the bma if a class insurer or a class insurer fails to meet and or maintain the required minimum solvency margin 
both class insurers and class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class insurers and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to those under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
annual statutory financial return 
class and class insurers are required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  a declaration of the statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist in respect of the loss and loss expense provisions and  only in the case of class insurers  certain details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the solvency certificate and the declaration of the statutory ratios must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer  who are required to state whether the minimum solvency margin and  in the case of the solvency certificate  the minimum liquidity ratio  have been met  and the independent approved auditor is required to state whether in its opinion it was reasonable for them to so state and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
where an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
supervision  investigation and intervention 
the bma may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders 
in order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to them  the bma may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurer s business 
moreover  the bma has the power to appoint professional persons to prepare reports about registered insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries  parents and other affiliates of registered insurers 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent  or that the insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions or its registration under the insurance act  the bma may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business  not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer s liabilities  not to make certain investments  to realize or not to realize certain investments  to maintain in  or transfer to the custody of  a specified bank  certain assets  not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments and or to limit its premium income 
in addition to powers under the insurance act to investigate the affairs of an insurer  the bma may require certain information from an insurer or certain other persons to be produced to them 
the bma has the power to assist other regulatory authorities  including foreign insurance regulatory authorities  with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in bermuda if the bma is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest 
in  the bma commenced an on site review of the company  which is currently still ongoing 
under the companies act  the minister has been given powers to assist a foreign regulatory authority which has requested assistance in connection with inquiries being carried out by it in the performance of its regulatory functions 
the minister s powers include requiring a person to furnish him with information  to produce documents to him  to attend and answer questions and to give assistance in connection with enquiries 
the minister must be satisfied that the assistance requested by the foreign regulatory authority is for the purpose of its regulatory functions and that the request is in relation to information in bermuda which a person has in his possession or under his control 
the minister must consider  amongst other things  whether it is in the public interest to give the information sought 
an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  the principal office of each of renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe is at our offices at renaissance house  east broadway  pembroke hm bermuda 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless fourteen days notice in writing to the bma is given of the intention to do so 
it is the duty of the principal representative  having formed the view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent or its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe that a reportable event has occurred  to orally notify the bma immediately and  within fourteen days of the relevant view having been formed  to make a report in writing to the bma setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
examples of such an event include failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio 
certain other bermuda law considerations 
as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries are exempt from certain bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non bermudians 
however  as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries may not participate in certain business transactions  including the acquisition or holding of land in bermuda except that required for their business and held by way of lease or tenancy for terms of not more than years without required authorization  the taking of mortgages on land in bermuda to secure an amount in excess of  without the consent of the minister  the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in bermuda  other than certain types of bermuda government securities or securities issued by bermuda public authorities or  the carrying on of business of any kind in bermuda  except in furtherance of our business carried on outside bermuda or under license granted by the minister 
generally it is not permitted without a special license granted by the minister to insure bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of  in or based in bermuda 
we and our bermuda subsidiaries must comply with the provisions of the companies act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus 
a company may not declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a the company is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or b the realizable value of the company s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
us regulation reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda operations consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe and lantana 
renaissance reinsurance and davinci are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although neither company is admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  policy terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance in the following circumstances

if none of the above apply  to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately  typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer 
as alien companies  our bermuda subsidiaries collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance from within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
neither renaissance reinsurance nor davinci intends to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction other than bermuda where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe and lantana  both domiciled in bermuda  are not licensed in the us but are eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in jurisdictions of the us and is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of those jurisdictions 
lantana is currently eligible as a surplus lines insurer in jurisdictions of the us  and is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of those jurisdictions 
in accordance with certain provisions of the national association of insurance commissioners naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe and lantana have each established  and are required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us the regulation of surplus lines insurance differs significantly from the licensed or admitted market 
the regulations governing the surplus lines market have been designed to facilitate the procurement of coverage  through specially licensed surplus lines brokers  for hard to place risks that do not fit standard underwriting criteria and are otherwise eligible to be written on a surplus lines basis 
most particularly  surplus lines regulation generally provides for more flexible rules relating to insurance rates and forms 
however  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and state insurance regulations generally require that a risk must be declined by three admitted carriers before it may be placed in the surplus lines market 
initial eligibility requirements and annual requalification standards apply to insurance carriers writing on a surplus basis and filing obligations must also be met 
in most states  surplus lines brokers are responsible for collecting and remitting the surplus lines tax payable to the state where the risk is located 
companies such as glencoe and lantana which conduct business on a surplus lines basis in a particular state are generally exempt from that state s guaranty fund laws 
admitted market regulation 
our admitted us operations currently consist of stonington and stonington lloyds  both texas domiciled insurers 
in addition  our insurance company subsidiaries newstead and inverness recently received certificates of authority as admitted  licensed insurers in delaware and arizona  respectively  although newstead and inverness have not yet conducted any business 
as licensed insurers operating in the admitted market  these companies are subject to extensive regulation under us statutes 
the extent of regulation varies from state to state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
among other things  state insurance commissioners regulate insurer solvency standards  insurer licensing  authorized investments  premium rates  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  loss and expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  policy form approval  policy renewals and non renewals  and market conduct regulation including both underwriting and claims practices 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports 
the texas department of insurance retains primary regulatory authority for stonington and stonington lloyd s  the delaware department of insurance is the primary regulator for newstead and the arizona department of insurance is inverness primary regulator 
in general  licensed us insurers must file with the state departments of insurance in whose states they insure risks all rates for directly underwritten insurance 
licensed us insurers are required to participate in the guaranty associations of the states where they conduct business 
such participation can result in assessments  up to prescribed limits  for losses incurred by policyholders as a result of the impairment or insolvency of unaffiliated insurance companies 
additionally  some states require licensed insurers to participate in assigned risk plans or other residual market mechanisms which provide coverage with respect to certain lines for insureds that are unable to obtain insurance in the open market 
participation in these residual market mechanisms may take various forms including reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or directly issuing policies to insureds 
an insurer s participation in these plans is typically calculated based on the amount of premium written by the insurer on a voluntary basis for that line of coverage in a prior year 
assigned risk pools generally produce losses which result in assessments to insurers writing the same or similar lines on a voluntary basis 
we expect our exposure to assessments generally to grow over time  as a result of our growth and the relative change in our product mix 
holding company regulation 
we and our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various jurisdictions 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally require an insurance holding company  and insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies  to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports  including information concerning their capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
further  in order to protect insurance company solvency  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies 
texas  stonington s and stonington lloyd s state of domicile  currently requires that dividends be paid only out of earned statutory surplus and limits the annual amount of dividends payable without the prior approval of the texas insurance department to the greater of of statutory capital and surplus at the end of the previous calendar year or of statutory net income from operations for the previous calendar year 
because of the accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington currently cannot pay an ordinary dividend 
these insurance holding company laws also impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  as a result of our ownership of stonington  newstead and inverness under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity desiring to purchase more than of our outstanding voting securities is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for the purchase 
terrorism 
in november  the president of the us signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  which provides for the federal government to share with the insurance industry the risk of loss from certain future terrorist attacks 
each participating insurance company must pay covered losses equal to a deductible based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for specified commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year 
tria was originally scheduled to expire at the end of  but was extended in december for an additional two years 
as extended  the insurer deductible will be increased from in to in and in for losses in excess of a company s deductible  the federal government will cover of the excess losses in  while companies retain the remaining  with the government s share decreasing to in losses covered by the program remain capped annually at billion 
the extended tria will establish a new program trigger under which federal compensation will become available only if aggregate insured losses sustained by all insurers exceed million from a certified act of terrorism occurring after march  and million for losses resulting from a certified act which occurs on or after january  this new trigger will be in addition to the million certification threshold for an event to be certified 
we cannot assure you that tria will be extended beyond  and its expiration could have an adverse effect on our clients  the industry or us 
naic ratios 
the naic has established financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed us insurance companies operating in their respective states 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments 
each ratio has an established usual range of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result  rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
an insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial 
generally  an insurance company will be subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios 
risk based capital 
the naic has implemented a risk based capital rbc formula and model law applicable to all licensed us property casualty insurance companies 
the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
such analysis permits regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurers 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory capital by applying certain factors to insurers business risks such as asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer s size  but also on the risk profile of the insurer s operations 
insurers that have less statutory capital than the rbc calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies 
our us insurance subsidiaries have satisfied the rbc formula since it was created in the mid s and have exceeded all recognized industry solvency standards 
as of february   all of our us insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action 
the gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act of glba permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company  a financial holding company 
until passage of the glba  the glass steagall act of  as amended  had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses  and the bank holding company act of  as amended  had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers 
as a result of glba  the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may affect our us subsidiaries product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
privacy provisions of glba became fully effective in these provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of the privacy policies of financial institutions  including us insurers  to their consumer customers 
congress is considering a bill called the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of the proposed bill would establish a privately financed trust fund to provide payments to individuals with asbestos related illnesses and would stay asbestos claims in the tort litigation system 
the trust would be financed by primary insurers  reinsurers and industrial enterprises and the insurance industry would be responsible for funding a certain share of the total costs 
medical criteria would be established to attempt to ensure that only people who showed signs of asbestos related illnesses would be entitled to payments from the trust 
it is difficult to predict whether the proposed bill will be enacted  and if so  what proportion of trust fund monies the insurance industry will be responsible to provide 
legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets  both in the us and worldwide  continues to evolve 
federal and state legislators have considered numerous government initiatives 
while we cannot predict the exact nature  timing  or scope of other such proposals  if adopted they could adversely affect our business by

in addition  the expansion of our primary insurance operations  together with the potential of further expansion into additional insurance markets  could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight

item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following our exposure to catastrophic events could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next  and the frequency and severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates 
our largest product based on total gross premiums written is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance and certain individual risk products that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of large magnitude 
claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to write new business could also be affected 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation will continue to increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we may have greater exposures in some geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would suggest 
accordingly  if catastrophes were to occur in these areas  we could experience relatively more severe net negative impacts than our competitors 
during we experienced million of net negative impact from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
principally as a result of these hurricane losses in  we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million 
in we recorded million of net negative impact from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
recent scientific studies have indicated that the frequency of hurricanes may increase in the future relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we have adjusted our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret these studies 
however  it is possible that  even after these adjustments  we have underestimated the frequency of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
we may fail to execute our strategy in our newer lines of business  which would impair our future financial results 
historically  our principal product has been property catastrophe reinsurance 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk lines of business present us with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
we are not as experienced in these lines of business as we are in property catastrophe reinsurance  for example  we are continuing to expand our claims management function to support these new lines of business 
businesses in early stages of development present substantial business  financial and operational risks and may suffer significant losses 
for example  in our newer businesses we are seeking to develop client and customer relationships  build operating procedures  hire staff  develop and install management information and other systems  as well as taking numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk businesses also require us to develop new expertise in areas such as contract and policy wordings and claims management 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these new lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
our expansion into these newer lines of business has placed increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
for example  we may need to attract additional professionals to  or expand our facilities in  bermuda  a small jurisdiction with limited resources 
to the extent we are unable to attract additional professionals  our financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives  potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage this expansion 
our inability to achieve such development or effective management may impair our future financial results 
our utilization of brokers  program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
our individual risk operations rely on program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our operations in this segment 
in these arrangements  we typically grant the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provide and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our managers issue policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for such policies 
although we would intend to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program manager would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also rely on our managers  or other third parties we retain  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
this exposes us to their credit and operational risk  without necessarily relieving us of our obligations to potential insureds 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage substantially all of the claims activity that we expect to arise in our program operations 
although we have implemented monitoring and other oversight protocols  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of these exposures 
we are also subject to the risk that our successful program managers will not renew their programs with us 
our contracts are generally for defined terms of as little as one year  and either party can cancel the contract in a relatively short period of time 
while we believe our arrangements offer numerous benefits to our program participants  we cannot assure you we will retain the programs that produce profitable business or that our insureds will renew with us 
failure to retain or replace these producers would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy  and our financial results could be adversely affected 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our clients may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
us government authorities are continuing to investigate non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products  as well as our restatement of our financial statements 
in  we received subpoenas from the sec  the nyag and the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york  each of which relates to the industry wide investigation into non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products 
the subpoenas from the sec and the united states attorney s office also relate to our business practice review and to our determination to restate our financial statements 
in addition  we understand that certain of our customers or reinsurers may have been asked to provide or have provided documents and information with respect to reinsurance contracts to which we are a party in the framework of the ongoing industry wide investigations 
see legal proceedings 
we are cooperating with the sec  the nyag  and the united states attorney s office in these ongoing investigations 
the sec and the united states attorney s office have continued to request information from the company in connection with their investigations 
a number of current and former officers and employees of the company have been interviewed and deposed in connection with these investigations 
it is possible that additional investigations or proceedings may be commenced against the company and or its current or former senior executives in connection with these matters  which could be criminal or civil 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these investigations or the impact these investigations may have on our business  including as to our senior management team 
these investigations could result in penalties  require remediation  or otherwise impact the company and or our senior management team in a manner which may be adverse to us  perhaps materially so 
we intend to continue to cooperate with these investigations 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength may adversely impact our business 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  our glencoe group carriers  top layer re and davinci 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically the rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
in november  following our announcement that our then chairman and ceo resigned from the company in light of the government investigations resulting from the company s restatement of its financial results and our announcement that our chief financial officer and chief operating officer john m 
lummis intends to retire at the of his contract term on june   various rating agencies downgraded our ratings 
our ratings with these agencies generally remain on watch 
see item i ratings 
in addition  following the higher levels of hurricane frequency in and  we understand that the rating agencies may review whether or not to require insurance and reinsurance companies that retain catastrophe risk  such as ourselves  to hold a higher level of capital to support this risk  if the insurance or reinsurance companies are to maintain their ratings 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance remain among the highest in our business  these ratings actions could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize the market opportunities we currently expect to participate in over coming periods 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a further downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
the rating agencies may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose clients to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our clients 
the rating of top layer re is dependent in large part upon the rating of state farm  who provides top layer re with billion of stop loss reinsurance 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the capital requirements of our business depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares 
our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position and operating results  market conditions  and applicable legal issues 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital if and when needed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  and our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claim reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations are expected to produce claims which frequently can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property losses which tend to be reported comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time 
for both our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  and our traditional property catastrophe business  actual net claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid will differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
our estimates of losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  as well as the previously reported hurricanes and windstorms  are based on factors including currently available information derived from our preliminary claims information from clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
due to the size and unusual complexity of the legal and claims issues relating to these recent events  particularly hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  various of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations to us 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
unlike the loss reserves of us insurers  the loss reserves of renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe are not regularly examined by insurance regulators  although  as registered bermuda insurers  we are required to submit opinions of our approved loss reserve specialist with the annual statutory financial returns of our bermuda licensed insurers with regard to their respective loss and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified actuary  must be approved by the bermuda monetary authority 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
the sec  the nyag  the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york and other government authorities are scrutinizing and investigating a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
it is possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
because we frequently assume the credit risk of the brokers with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these brokers is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to broker industry practices 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
as part of our risk management we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance when purchased to protect reinsurance companies is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
our primary insurance companies also buy reinsurance from third parties 
a reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance treaty with us could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining reinsurance 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
when we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account  the insolvency  inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we believe that the willingness to pay of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining  and that the overall industry ability to pay has also declined to due to the adverse results of the last two years and other factors 
this risk is more material to us at present than at most times in the past given the substantial retrocessional claims to which we are entitled following the recent large catastrophe loss events 
at december  we had recorded million of reinsurance recoverables  net of a valuation allowance of million for uncollectible recoverables 
in addition  approximately million of our outstanding recoverables as of that date are with three ceding companies 
emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
although we are seeking to add professional staff and systems to improve our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
market participants continue to raise and accumulate new capital  thereby strengthening their ability to compete 
in addition  hedge funds are increasing the overall capacity in the industry 
increased capacity levels have led to increased competition 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace limited  everest re group ltd  ipc holdings  ltd  partnerre ltd 
and xl capital ltd 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as aig  berkshire  munich re group and swiss re 
in addition  there are other relatively new bermuda reinsurers with whom we compete  such as allied world assurance company  arch  axis capital holdings  endurance specialty holdings  montpelier re holdings and platinum 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
following hurricane katrina in august  a significant number of new reinsurance companies were formed in bermuda which may result in substantial new competition for and subsequent periods 
we believe there has been at least billion of new capital that has been contributed to these new bermuda based reinsurance enterprises 
in addition  we believe existing reinsurance companies have raised in excess of billion of new capital subsequent to hurricane katrina to rebuild their capital position and to capitalize on new opportunities 
also  hedge funds have shown increasing interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the reinsurance market or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
we also continue to experience a degree of competition from alternative products from capital market participants that are intended to compete with reinsurance products and which could impact the demand for traditional catastrophe reinsurance  as well as increased competitive activities from hedge funds 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
the businesses in which our individual risk unit operates are also highly competitive 
primary insurers compete on the basis of factors including distribution channels  product  price  service and financial strength 
many of our primary insurance competitors are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources and consumer recognition 
we seek primary insurance pricing that will result in adequate returns on the capital allocated to our primary insurance business 
we may lose primary insurance business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices 
us taxing authorities could contend that our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax 
if the us internal revenue service the irs were to contend successfully that renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re is engaged in a trade or business in the us  renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously resist such a contention  if we were ultimately held to be subject to taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 
in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re in the us are only available to any of renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re may not be able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish it to the satisfaction of the irs 
finally  it should be noted that it is unclear whether the income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
the loss of key senior members of management could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers 
since april  we have replaced three of our senior members of management and we announced in november that our chief operating officer and chief financial officer john m 
lummis has indicated that he intends to retire at the end of his contract term on june  we are unable to predict at this time the ultimate impact these departures may have on our business 
we may lose clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing executives 
in addition  the loss of services of these executives  or other members of senior management in the future  and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team  may strain our ability to execute our growth initiatives  as described above 
in general  the loss of the services of any members of our current senior management team may adversely affect our business  perhaps materially so 
in addition  our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without the specific permission of the appropriate government authority 
the bermuda government will issue a work permit for a specific period of time  which may be extended upon showing that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
if any of our senior executive officers were not permitted to remain in bermuda  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our financial results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which contains fixed maturity securities  such as bonds and mortgage backed securities 
our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
as our invested assets have grown substantially in recent years  a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a significant adverse effect on our overall results 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments will be subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
as a result of large reinsurance or insurance losses  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
in recent years we have allocated a portion of our portfolio to other investments which have different risk characteristics than our traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investment portfolios 
these other investments include hedge fund investments  a fund that invests in senior secured bank loans  a european high yield credit fund and private equity partnerships 
also included in other investments are investments in a medium term note  representing an interest in a pool of european fixed income securities  a non us dollar convertible fund and miscellaneous other investments 
we have started decreasing our percentage allocation to these other investments  particularly hedge funds  and subject to lock up and redemption provisions  our other investments will likely decrease 
the performance of these other investments had a positive impact on the performance of our investment portfolio in these other investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of certain of these investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of the investments 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our other investments are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes of the investments 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
we are unable to precisely quantify these risks as we do not have timely access to the securities underlying each investment 
to the extent these risks move against us it could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective 
the result of either of the foregoing could be a material adverse change to our investment performance 
our reliance on reinsurance brokers exposes us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid by the cedant and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
as noted above  due to recent developments in the industry  we believe that the degree of this credit risk has increased 
the reinsurance business is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline  which could affect our profitability 
the reinsurance and insurance industries have been historically cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of the catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
as noted  changes in the pricing environment may result from changes in the perception of risk following large industry loss events 
in particular  the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions  and acts of terrorism  such as hurricane katrina and the world trade center disaster 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future 
if demand for our product falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  we expect our growth to be adversely affected  and our profitability could be affected as well 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline new business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 
in addition  a substantial amount of capital has entered the insurance and reinsurance markets both through investments in established companies and through start up ventures as described above 
hedge funds have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
it is possible that the new capital in the market could cause further reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would plan to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
consolidation in the insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that many insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
bermuda could be subject to sanctions by a number of multinational organizations which could adversely affect bermuda companies 
a number of multinational organizations  including the european union  the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd  including its financial action task force  and the financial stability forum  have identified certain countries as blocking information exchange  engaging in harmful tax competition or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption  such as money laundering activities 
on june  the oecd issued a discussion draft  attribution of profits to a permanent establishment release of discussion draft of part iv insurance the draft  which constitutes the fourth and final part of the report on oecd s project to establish a broad consensus regarding the interpretation and practical application of article article of the oecd model tax convention on income and on capital 
article sets forth international tax principles for attributing profits to a permanent establishment and forms the basis of an extensive network of bilateral income tax treaties between oecd member countries and between many oecd member and non member countries 
once finalized  the conclusions of parts i iv of the report will be implemented through revision of the commentary on article and or article itself 
the oecd has threatened non member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the oecd with punitive sanctions by oecd member countries 
it is unclear what these sanctions will be  who will adopt them and when they will be imposed 
bermuda has committed to a course of action to enable compliance with the requirements of these multinational organizations  including signing a letter committing itself to eliminate harmful tax practices by the end of and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
however  the action taken by bermuda may not be sufficient to preclude all effects of the measures or sanctions described above  which if ultimately adopted could adversely affect bermuda companies such as us and our bermuda based subsidiaries 
political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
increasingly  governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem to us to be interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the national association of insurance commissioners naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia and state insurance regulators  regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to

disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another 
the growth of our primary insurance business  which is regulated more comprehensively than reinsurance  increases our exposure to adverse political  judicial and legal developments 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the united kingdom uk  may consider changes to its relationship with the uk in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda s position in respect of future regulatory initiatives  which could adversely impact us commercially 
because we depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers for a large portion of revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
four brokerage firms accounted for of our net premiums written for the year ended december  subsidiaries and affiliates of the benfield group limited  marsh inc  the willis group and aon corporation accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our gross written premiums in the loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
we could be adversely affected if tria is not renewed 
in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the september th tragedy  tria was enacted in to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the us 
as described in business regulation us regulation  this law established a federal assistance program through the end of as amended  through the end of to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and required that coverage for terrorist acts be offered by insurers 
tria was originally scheduled to expire at the end of  but was extended in december for an additional two years 
the extended bill reduced the protections of the act 
for example  as extended  the insurer deductible was increased from in to in and in in addition  the extended tria established a new program trigger under which federal compensation will become available only if aggregate insured losses sustained by all insurers exceed million from a certified act of terrorism occurring after march  and million for losses resulting from a certified act which occurs on or after january  we believe tria has been an effective mechanism to assist policyholders and industry participants with the extreme contingent losses that might be caused by acts of terrorism 
we cannot assure you that tria will be extended beyond  and its expiration could have an adverse effect on our clients  industry or us 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  consisting of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  a million bank loan incurred and fully drawn by our consolidated subsidiary  davincire holdings ltd 
davincire  and million drawn by renaissancere on its syndicated revolving credit agreement  which was drawn on december  in addition  we have issued million aggregate liquidation amount of mandatorily redeemable capital securities capital securities through the capital trust holding solely million of the company s junior subordinated debentures due march  because we hold million of these securities and also hold million of equity interest in the capital trust  our net obligation is million 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain letter of credit facilities in connection with their insurance and reinsurance business 
the largest of these is a secured letter of credit facility established under a reimbursement agreement entered into by certain of renaissancere s subsidiaries and affiliates 
the obligations of each of renaissancere s subsidiaries and affiliates party to the reimbursement agreement are secured by certain collateral  including cash  eligible high quality marketable securities and redeemable preference shares of rihl 
the facility currently is in the amount of billion 
at february   the aggregate face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the reimbursement agreement with effective dates on or before december  was  million and total letters of credit outstanding was  million 
the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain numerous covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 
in addition  if we are in default under the junior subordinated debentures  discussed above  or if we have given notice of our intention to defer our related payment obligations  the terms of our indebtedness would  among other things  restrict our ability to

spacer

redeem  purchase or acquire any capital shares  or 
spacer

make a liquidation payment with respect to our capital shares 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 
bermuda law and regulations require our subsidiaries which are registered in bermuda as insurers to maintain a minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio  and prohibit dividends that would result in a breach of these requirements 
further  renaissance reinsurance and davinci  as class insurers in bermuda  may not pay dividends which would exceed of their respective capital and surplus  unless they first make filings confirming that they meet the required margins 
as class insurers  glencoe  lantana and top layer re may not declare or pay dividends during any financial year that would cause glencoe  lantana or top layer re as the case may be to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio 
generally  our us insurance subsidiaries may only pay dividends out of earned surplus 
further  the amount payable without the prior approval of the applicable state insurance department is generally limited to the greater of of policyholders surplus or statutory capital  or of the subsidiary s prior year statutory net income 
since our us insurance subsidiaries earned surplus is negative  these subsidiaries cannot currently pay dividends without the applicable state insurance department approval 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us recently  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has been subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that the us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda disproportionately 
any such development could adversely affect us 
glencoe and lantana are currently eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurers in  respectively  and states and territories of the us and are each subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these states 
however  neither glencoe nor lantana is admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s and lantana s activities in the us is limited  which could adversely affect their ability to compete 
in addition  stonington  which writes insurance in all states and the district of columbia on an admitted basis  is subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors  and relates to such matters as rate setting  policy forms  limitations on dividends and transactions with affiliates  solvency standards which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  which includes periodic market conduct examinations by the regulatory authorities  annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory accounting basis  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with these requirements  and could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
we plan to grow stonington s business and  accordingly  expect our absolute and relative regulatory burden to increase 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our subsidiaries to become subject to additional regulation in other jurisdictions 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in a defect or error in our information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
a portion of our premium is written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves is also in non dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash equivalent investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our amended and restated bye laws the bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for

a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 
renaissancere indirectly owns stonington  stonington lloyd s  inverness and newstead 
our ownership of a us insurance company such as these can  under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations  delay or impede a change of control of renaissancere 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process

item legal proceedings we received a subpoena from the sec in february  a subpoena from the nyag in march  and a subpoena from the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york in june  each of which relates to the industry wide investigations into non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products 
the subpoenas from the sec and the united states attorney s office also relate to our business practice review and to our determination to restate the company s financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and in july  james n 
stanard  the company s then chairman and chief executive officer  received a wells notice from the staff of the sec in connection with the sec s investigation 
the company understands that michael w 
cash  a former officer of the company  also received a wells notice in connection with the sec s investigation 
in addition  in september  the company received a wells notice in connection with the sec s investigation 
the wells notices indicate that the staff intends to recommend that the sec bring a civil enforcement action against the recipients alleging violations of federal securities laws and that the staff may seek permanent injunctive relief  civil penalties and disgorgement 
in april  we also received subpoenas from the sec and the nyag relating to our investment in channel re 
we are cooperating with the sec  the nyag  and the united states attorney s office in these ongoing investigations 
the sec and the united states attorney s office have continued to request information from the company in connection with their investigations 
a number of current and former officers and employees of the company have been interviewed and deposed in connection with these investigations 
it is possible that additional investigations or proceedings may be commenced against the company and or its current or former senior executives in connection with these matters  which could be criminal or civil 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these investigations or the impact these investigations may have on our business  including as to our senior management team 
these investigations could result in injunctive relief  penalties  require remediation  or otherwise impact the company and or our senior management team in a manner which may be adverse to us  perhaps materially so 
we intend to continue to cooperate with these investigations 
in addition  we understand that certain of our contractual counterparties may have been asked to provide or have provided documents and information with respect to contracts to which we are a party in the framework of the ongoing industry wide investigations

ia pension trust fund for operating engineers and joseph moss were appointed co lead plaintiffs  and lerach coughlin stoia geller rudman robbins llp and schiffrin barroway  llp were appointed co lead counsel 
on february   co lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint  which purports to have been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased and or acquired the publicly traded securities of the company between april  and july  the class period 
the consolidated amended complaint names  in addition to the company  current and former officers of the company as defendants messrs 
stanard  riker  lummis  cash and merritt 
the consolidated amended complaint alleges that the company and the other named defendants violated the us federal securities laws by making material misstatements and failing to state material facts about the company s business and financial condition in  among other things  securities act filings and public statements 
the suit  which is at an early stage  seeks compensatory damages without specifying an amount 
as a result  we cannot at this time estimate our potential costs related to these legal matters and  accordingly  no liability for compensatory damages has been established as of december  in our consolidated financial statements 
the company s response to the consolidated amended complaint is due on april  the company intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages 
generally  our primary insurance operations are subject to greater frequency and diversity of claims and claims related litigation and  in some jurisdictions  may be subject to direct actions by allegedly injured persons or entities seeking damages from policyholders 
these lawsuits  involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business  are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves which are discussed in our loss reserves discussion 
in addition to claims litigation  we and our subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies 
this category of business litigation may involve allegations of underwriting or claims handling errors or misconduct  employment claims  regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures 
while any such litigation or arbitration contains an element of uncertainty  we believe that any such normal course litigation or arbitration to which we are presently a party is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the years ended december  and december  the following also includes a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this filing 
this filing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results described or implied by these forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements 
overview renaissancere was established in to write property catastrophe reinsurance 
by pioneering the use of sophisticated computer models to construct our portfolio  we believe we have become one of the world s largest and most successful catastrophe reinsurers 
recently  we have leveraged our expertise and have established additional franchises in other selected areas of insurance and reinsurance 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to clients affected by these events 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  corporate expenses which include certain executive  legal and consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt  preference shares and subordinated obligation to our capital trust 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
in the future we expect our relative tax expenses to increase 
the operating results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio below generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior years  divided by net premiums earned 
we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
those segments are more fully described as follows reinsurance our reinsurance segment has three main components 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
property catastrophe reinsurance written for our own account and davinci  our traditional core business 
our subsidiary renaissance reinsurance is one of the world s leading providers of this coverage 
this coverage protects against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and tsunamis  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes and explosions 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
specialty reinsurance written for our own account and davinci covering certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk that we assume  our portfolio in includes various classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice and certain casualty lines 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety and terrorism  and that we have a growing reputation as a first call market for these products 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
through ventures  we pursue joint ventures and other strategic relationships 
our three principal business activities in this area are catastrophe oriented joint ventures which we manage  such as top layer re and davinci  customized reinsurance transactions  such as offering participations in our catastrophe portfolio  and investments in other market participants  such as our investments in channel re and platinum  and other activities which are directed at non catastrophe classes of risk 
only business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of top layer re  channel re and platinum are included in the other category of our segment results 
individual risk we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include commercial and homeowners property coverages  including catastrophe exposed products  commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile  professional and various specialty products  multi peril crop insurance  and reinsurance of other insurers on a quota share basis 
our individual risk business is primarily produced through three distribution channels program managers where we write primary insurance through specialized program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who  similar to our program managers  provide most of the back office and support functions  and brokers where we write primary insurance produced through licensed intermediaries on a risk by risk basis 
our individual risk business is written by the glencoe group through its principal operating subsidiaries glencoe and lantana  which write on an excess and surplus lines basis  and through stonington and stonington lloyds  which write on an admitted basis 
as noted above  we rely on third parties for services including the generation of premium  the issuance of policies and the processing of claims 
we actively oversee our third party partners through an operations review team at glencoe group services inc  which conducts initial due diligence as well as ongoing monitoring 
summary of critical accounting estimates claims and claim expense reserves we believe that the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
our estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors such as inflation 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will be greater or less than such estimates and that  at times  this variance will be material 
also  reserving for our reinsurance and individual risk businesses can involve added uncertainty because of the dependence on information from ceding companies  the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us  and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid and incurred losses and may sometimes also include an estimate of incurred but not reported reserves ibnr 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance business  which is generally characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity  reporting of claims in general tends to be prompt as compared to reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes  earthquakes or terrorism  the geographic area involved  and the quality of each customer s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments regarding these factors are reflected in management s reserve estimates 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports of such events to augment our loss reserve estimation process 
however  based upon the amount and timing of the reported claims from any one or more catastrophic events  such reserve estimates may change significantly from one quarter to another 
once we receive a notice of loss under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process such claims promptly 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance operations  we initially set our claims reserves based on case reserves reported by insureds and ceding companies 
we then add to these case reserves our estimates for additional case reserves  and an estimate for ibnr 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants  we also use industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
when property catastrophe losses do occur  the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies against such loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss  and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 
since our individual risk segment has been issuing insurance policies for certain commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile and professional liability risks 
the claim reporting and claim development periods of these risks are generally expected to be longer than the reporting and development periods for our property risks  and  accordingly  there is normally greater uncertainty in the estimation of the reserves associated with these policies 
the loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations is different than that for property catastrophe oriented coverages and these coverages are potentially subject to greater uncertainties  relating to factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
we estimate our ibnr for these coverages by utilizing an actuarial method known as the bornhuetter ferguson technique 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson technique requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an estimated loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
for the company s specialty and individual risk lines we also considered estimating reserves utilizing paid and incurred development methods 
we elected to use the bornhuetter ferguson technique because this method allows for weight to be applied to expected results  and hence is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of paid and or reported loss data 
the company s reserving methodology for each line of business  as discussed above  uses a loss reserving model that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate losses as opposed to a methodology that develops a range of estimates 
the company then uses this point estimate  along with paid and incurred data  to record its estimate of ibnr 
the company does not use sensitivity analysis in calculating reserves and therefore does not make any specific quantitative assumptions in connection with such an analysis 
see reserves for claims and claim expenses for a breakdown of our case reserves and ibnr by line of business 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
therefore  because of these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in future periods  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
with the growth in our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we announced in early that we would review the processes and assumptions for establishing and evaluating our reserves during we completed reviews of our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves  specialty reinsurance reserves and individual risk reserves in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced prior year reserves within our reinsurance and individual risk segments by million and million  respectively 
after adjusting for the impact of minority interest  our net loss was reduced by million as a result of these reviews 
within our reinsurance segment  the reserve changes for our property catastrophe portfolio reflect a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for our specialty reinsurance business  the changes were principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore we have adjusted our estimated loss reporting patterns to reflect this experience 
the changes within our individual risk segment as a result of the reserve review were insignificant 
all of our estimates are reviewed annually with an independent actuarial firm 
we also review certain assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
adjustments to our prior year estimated claims reserves will impact our current year net income loss by increasing our net income or decreasing our net loss if the prior year estimated claims reserves are determined to be overstated  or by reducing our net income or increasing our net loss if the prior year estimated claims reserves prove to be insufficient 
during the years ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves had the following impact for  prior year estimated claims reserves were reduced by million  for  prior year estimated claims reserves were reduced by million  and for  prior year estimated claims reserves were reduced by million  and in each year there was a corresponding decrease to net loss or increase to net income 
although we believe we are cautious in our assumptions  and in the application of our methodologies  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  perhaps materially  from the estimates we have made 
see reserves for claims and claim expenses 
as noted above  because of the numerous factors which can affect reserves for claims and claim expenses  but which cannot be determined with certainty in advance  we have a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable reserve development on our reserves for older accident years 
in comparison to our property catastrophe portfolio of reinsurance coverage which we have been writing for over ten years  we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in our specialty reinsurance and individual risk lines 
during we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
these losses are in addition to significant losses in from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from preliminary claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of the issues relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  various of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
losses recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
the estimate of losses recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  losses recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
losses recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured industry losses that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency  as per the contract terms 
in addition  the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on losses recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount of the losses recoverable to be recorded as well as delay the recognition of losses recoverable to reporting periods that are different from the underlying loss 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future 
the amounts recoverable ultimately collected are open to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims  for reasons including insolvency and elective run off  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
in addition  because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time  economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change  and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
to reflect these uncertainties  we estimate and record a valuation allowance for potential uncollectible losses recoverable which reduces losses recoverable and net earnings 
we estimate our valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each recovery based on our counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain recoveries that we deem unlikely to be collected in full 
we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the valuation allowance based on other qualitative and judgmental factors 
the valuation allowance recorded against losses recoverable was million at december  million 
the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for  and  respectively  of our losses recoverable balance at december   and  respectively 
the three largest company specific components of the valuation allowance represented  and of our total valuation allowance at december   and 
premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
consistent with industry practice  we generally recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is usually the date we are on risk for the policy and this is generally the date on which the reinsurance slip is signed 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 
we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are either estimated or earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
in our individual risk business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and by program managers and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies and program managers  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our individual risk business at december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and total estimated premiums earned were million  million and million  respectively 
total earned commissions estimated at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date such subsequent adjustments have not been material 
since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are used to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a significant loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves reported in the period 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross written premium  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned

represents premium ceded from the individual risk segment to the reinsurance segment 
summary overview we incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million in this was the first time in our corporate history in which we have suffered an annual net loss attributable to common shareholders 
our financial performance compares unfavorably to the million and million of net income attributable to common shareholders generated in and  respectively 
as a result of the net loss attributable to common shareholders  we incurred a return on average common equity and our book value per common share plus accumulated dividends decreased to at december   a decrease of from the amount at december  in and  we generated returns on average common equity of and  respectively  and increased our book value per common share plus accumulated dividends by and  respectively 
the three most significant items impacting our financial performance include the million net negative impact we incurred from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of  the million net favorable impact from the reserve reviews which we completed during  and million of incurred expenses related to our internal review and ongoing investigations into the company and certain of its present and former executive officers by governmental authorities 
in addition to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma occurring in  the year was also impacted by several other large natural catastrophes including hurricanes dennis and emily  european windstorm erwin as well as flooding in several european cities 
total insured losses from the catastrophes are estimated to be the most costly on record for a single year 
as one of the largest writers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  our financial results are negatively impacted when there are large insured catastrophe losses 
in we recorded a million net negative impact from hurricanes charley  frances  jeanne and ivan 
in there was an absence of similar large catastrophes and therefore our net income attributable to common shareholders was significantly higher in that year 
the following table summarizes the net financial statement impact of the hurricanes  reserve reviews and internal review related costs and hurricanes described above by segment

the net negative impact from the hurricanes described above includes the sum of net claims and claim expenses incurred  assumed and ceded reinstatement premiums earned  lost profit commissions  assessment related losses and expenses  and minority interest 
net negative impact is based on management s estimates following a review of our potential exposures and discussions with our counterparties 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events  delays in receiving claims data  uncertainty surrounding final industry losses reported by statistical reporting agencies which impact our reinsurance recoveries  the unusual legal and claim issues related to certain of the events and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation  meaningful additional uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry from these events 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as new or revised data is received from our counterparties  and other factors 
changes to these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur 
other significant items affecting include an increase in net investment income of million to million  compared to million in  due to higher investment returns and an increased level of invested assets in compared to  and partially offset by net realized losses on investments of million in  compared to net realized investment gains of million in the reduction in net realized gains on investments in was due to million of other than temporary impairment charges recognized in the year compared to million in net realized gains on investments in were million 
underwriting results by segment we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
our reinsurance segment provides reinsurance through our catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance business units and through ventures 
our individual risk segment provides primary insurance and quota share reinsurance 
our underwriting results by segment are provided below reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three business units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain activities of ventures

gross premiums written property catastrophe gross premiums written our property catastrophe gross premiums written increased by million to million in compared to million in  a increase 
much of this increase  however  consisted of premiums written which we view as loss related and attributable to the large catastrophes occurring during this loss related premium  which includes reinstatement premiums written as a result of large catastrophes  back up reinsurance coverage provided to companies to replace reinsurance protection lost following a large catastrophe  and reinsurance coverage provided to a company to cover named hurricanes  totaled million in and million in large catastrophes include hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma in and hurricanes charley  frances  jeanne and ivan in excluding this premium  which in the absence of similar large catastrophes we would not expect to recur  our property catastrophe gross premiums written declined in and in the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written  after deducting loss related premium  was primarily due to increased competition and softening prices in the property catastrophe market  in which we accordingly chose not to renew certain reinsurance contracts

specialty reinsurance gross premiums written our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written increased by million to million in compared to million in  an increase 
much of the increase in our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written  however  was attributable to premiums written due to the large catastrophes occurring during this loss related premium  which includes reinstatement premiums written as a result of large catastrophes  back up reinsurance coverage provided to companies to replace reinsurance protection lost following a large catastrophe  and reinsurance coverage provided to a company to cover named hurricanes  totaled million in and nil in excluding this premium  which in the absence of similar large catastrophes we would not expect to recur  our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written were essentially flat in when compared to in  our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written increased by when compared to the increase in our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written was primarily due to our focus on a few targeted areas of this market in where we believed we could leverage our expertise  including catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  casualty  property and terrorism specific classes of reinsurance 
in  we maintained our book of business  but did not find additional attractive opportunities 
for  we currently anticipate our specialty reinsurance gross premiums written will decline significantly compared to  after deducting the loss related premium described above 
our specialty reinsurance premiums are prone to significant volatility as this business is characterized by a relatively small number of large transactions

due to the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance business which we sell  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
we use our rems modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase  to determine the appropriateness of the pricing of each contract and whether or not it helps us to balance our portfolio of risks 
in  ceded premiums written include million of premiums written which we view as loss related and attributable to the large hurricanes 
this includes additional premium ceded on certain multi year retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts which was triggered as a result of hurricanes katrina and wilma 
excluding this loss related premium  ceded premiums written decreased by million  or in  and by million  or in the decrease in ceded premiums written is principally the result of a reduction in the availability of appropriately priced coverages 
to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk 
net premiums earned our net premiums earned were essentially flat in at million compared to million in included in net premiums earned are million and million of loss related net premium earned in and  respectively 
as discussed above  loss related premium includes reinstatement premiums written as a result of large catastrophes  back up reinsurance coverage provided to companies to replace reinsurance protection lost following a large catastrophe  and reinsurance coverage provided to a company to cover named hurricanes 
excluding the impact of this loss related earned premium  which in the absence of similar large catastrophes we would not expect to recur  our net premiums earned declined by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the increase in net premiums earned in compared to was due to the increase in specialty premium written in when compared to underwriting results in  we generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of  an expense ratio of  and an underwriting loss of million  compared to a net claims and claim expense ratio of  expense ratio of and an underwriting profit of million  in the deterioration in underwriting performance in was principally the result of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma which increased net claims and claim expenses by  million and added percentage points to our net claims and claim expense ratio 
in  hurricanes charley  frances  jeanne and ivan resulted in net claims and claim expenses of million and increased our net claims and claim expense ratio by percentage points 
in there was an absence of similar large catastrophes and we generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of  an expense ratio of and an underwriting profit of million in that year 
our underwriting results have also been significantly impacted by reductions of prior year estimated ultimate net claims reserves over the last three years 
we reduced prior year estimated ultimate net claims reserves by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the reduction of prior year reserves in was principally the result of our reserve reviews 
with the growth in our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we announced in early that we would review the processes and assumptions for establishing and evaluating our reserves during we completed reviews of our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance reserves in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced prior year reserves within our reinsurance segment by million  which reduced our net claims and claim expense ratio by percentage points 
after adjusting for the impact of minority interest  our net loss was reduced by million as a result of the reinsurance segment reserve reviews 
the reserve changes for our property catastrophe portfolio reflects a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for our specialty reinsurance business  the changes were principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore we have adjusted our estimated loss reporting patterns to reflect this experience 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million was primarily due to a re estimation of our ultimate losses associated with six large catastrophe events  a reduction in reserves from numerous smaller catastrophe events  and reductions from our specialty book of business 
the following financial data shows the net financial statement impact on our reinsurance segment as a result of the large hurricanes and reserve reviews and the large hurricanes

other primarily consists of assumed and ceded earned reinstatement premiums and lost profit commissions 
losses from our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance policies can be infrequent  but severe  as demonstrated by our and results as compared to during periods with benign property catastrophe loss activity  such as  we have the potential to produce a low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
also during and  as discussed under the premiums heading above  we increased our specialty reinsurance premiums written 
this increase in specialty reinsurance premiums will normally produce higher net claims and claim expenses than the property catastrophe reinsurance business which will generally cause the combined ratio of our reinsurance segment to increase in years with normal catastrophe loss activity 
during  given the magnitude of the hurricane losses from and and due to delays in receiving claims data and the likelihood of receiving new or revised data from our counterparties  the estimates of hurricane losses and related recoveries are likely to change  perhaps materially 
changes in these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of the costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally fluctuate in line with the fluctuation in gross premiums earned 
in  the acquisition expense ratio of was lower than the and  recorded in and  respectively  driven mainly by the significant amount of loss related premium generated in which typically has lower brokerage expenses associated with it 
operating expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses increased by million to million in when compared to  principally due to the reversal of million in accruals related to executive compensation  bonuses and incentive compensation in that did not recur in in addition  we have experienced growth in the number of employees in our reinsurance segment and we were in our new facilities for the full year in when compared to as a result  our underlying operating expenses have increased 
we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions 
we record these fees and profit commissions as a reduction in acquisition expenses or operating expenses and  accordingly  these fees have reduced our expense ratio 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include commercial and homeowners property coverages  including catastrophe exposed products  commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile  professional and various specialty products  multi peril crop insurance  and reinsurance of other insurers on a quota share basis 
we operate through the glencoe group of companies  whose principal operating subsidiaries are glencoe  stonington  stonington lloyds and lantana

also impacting the underwriting result in  and  were reductions of prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves was driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology used for the individual risk book of business and is primarily due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we had anticipated when estimating the initial ultimate claims and claims expense ratios and the initial loss reporting patterns 
the favorable development in includes a million reduction of prior years reserves as a result of the reserve review

other primarily consists of assumed and ceded earned reinstatement premiums and lost profit commissions 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of costs to acquire premiums and are comprised of fees and expenses paid to program managers  who source primary insurance premiums for us through specialized programs  primary insurers  for whom we write quota share reinsurance  and broker commissions and excise taxes paid to brokers  who source insurance for us on a risk by risk basis 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are generally determined based on a set percentage of premiums 
acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned have remained relatively consistent at  and in  and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of compensation and other general and administrative expenses 
our individual risk business operates with a limited number of employees and  accordingly  we outsource much of the administration of our individual risk business to program managers and third party administrators 
operating expenses increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase in operating expenses of million from to was principally due to an increase in staffing in our us operations as well as the us operations being fully operational for a full year in compared to a partial year in during  we began issuing insurance policies for certain commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile and professional liability risks 
the claim reporting and claim development periods of these risks are longer than the reporting and development periods for our property risks  and  accordingly  there is typically greater uncertainty in the estimation of the reserves associated with these policies 
during  given the magnitude of the hurricane losses and due to delays in receiving claims data and the likelihood of receiving new or revised data from our counterparties  the estimates of hurricane losses and related recoveries are likely to change  perhaps materially 
changes in these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur

our other investments performed well in and and generated a considerable amount of net investment income for us 
the increase in net investment income in compared to was largely a result of increased net investment income from hedge funds  private equity funds and other alternative investments  both as a result of higher returns and a higher level of invested assets over net investment income from these investments was million in  compared to million in given our recent decision to reduce our exposure to hedge funds and non investment grade fixed income investments  which form a significant component of other investments and contributed to the growth of our net investment income in and  we expect that we may experience a decline in net investment income associated with our other investments in equity in earnings of other ventures

our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity 
a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates rise  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio  although the actual amount of realized gains losses on sales of investments can be reduced depending on which specific securities we choose to sell 
the million net realized loss on investments in includes million in other than temporary impairment charges compared to million in and million in the significant increase in other than temporary impairment charges in was due to our decision to recognize impairment charges for all of our fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position as of december  as we do not currently have the intent to hold them until they fully recover in value 
this accounting is consistent with the guidance provided by the financial accountings standards board fasb in fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which was issued in the fourth quarter of rising interest rates during gave rise to a higher level of unrealized losses at december  compared to december   prior to our other than temporary impairment charge 
other than temporary impairment charges are recorded as net realized losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
credit related impairment charges in our fixed maturity investments available for sale were million in the balance is also net of a million realized gain from the sale of all of the company s shares of platinum during the fourth quarter of which generated net proceeds of million 
the remaining decrease in realized gains in compared to was due to a period of rising interest rates in the year in which sales of our securities resulted in realized losses

we are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
in we generated taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries which was offset by utilization of a net operating loss carryforward 
due to a history of losses in our us subsidiaries we continue to maintain a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax asset 
primarily due to utilization of our net operating loss carryforward  the net deferred tax asset decreased by million during during  our us tax paying subsidiaries did not generate taxable income and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against the remaining net deferred tax asset of million 
during  we wrote a limited amount of business in our us operations and therefore the related tax impact for was minimal 
we currently plan to continue to increase the amount of business written by our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries 
if  as a result  our us operations begin to generate taxable income over a sustained period of time  the appropriateness of the valuation allowance will continue to be reassessed  and  at such time that we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income and therefore be able to recover our net deferred tax asset  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which we make such determination 
there will be a corresponding increase in net income at such time  which may be material to the period in which such determination is made 
as of december   the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset was million 
financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and capital securities and to make dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our bermuda subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law  which require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiarieswas billion billion  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe declared aggregate cash dividends of million  million and nil  respectively  compared with million  million and  respectively  in because of an accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  glencoe group  glencoe  davincire and davinci are currently not permitted to pay ordinary dividends or return capital to their shareholders without bermuda monetary authority approval 
our principal us insurance subsidiary stonington is also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
restrictions with respect to dividends are based on state statutes 
in addition  there are restrictions based on risk based capital tests which is the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level 
if stonington s statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level  the commissioner is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect policyholders and creditors 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of stonington was million million 
because of an accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington cannot currently pay an ordinary dividend without commissioner approval 
in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million revolving credit facility to meet additional liquidity and capital requirements  of which million was drawn in december and which remained outstanding at december  cash flows cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of increases to net reserves for claims and claim expenses of million and an increase in the reserve for unearned premiums of million  offset by our net loss of million prior to dividends on preference shares  plus a million increase in the minority interest in the undistributed net income of davincire and an increase in premiums receivable of million 
the cash flows from operations were primarily used to increase our short term investments 
we have generated cash flows from operations in  and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
because a large portion of the coverages we provide typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
in addition  given the severity of losses incurred in from the large catastrophes  many of which were unpaid at december   it is likely that we will experience a significant amount of paid claims in which could result in us having negative cash flows from operations 
reserves for claims and claim expenses our gross case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr by line of business at december  and are as follows

at december   our total reserves for claims and claim expenses were  million and our estimated additional case reserves and ibnr reserves were  million 
a adjustment to our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves would equate to an million adjustment to net claims and claim expenses incurred  which represents of our net loss attributable to common shareholders  and of shareholders equity at december  as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies and estimates  the most significant accounting judgment made by management is the estimation of claims and claim expense reserves 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
a large portion of our coverages provide protection from natural and man made catastrophes which are generally infrequent  but can be significant  such as losses from hurricanes and earthquakes 
our claims and claim expense reserves will generally fluctuate  sometimes materially  based upon the occurrence of a significant natural or man made catastrophic loss for which we provide reinsurance 
our claims reserves will also fluctuate based on the payments we make for these large loss events 
the timing of our payments on loss events can be affected by the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers 
during  and we increased our specialty reinsurance and individual risk gross premiums written see premiums 
the addition of these lines of business adds complexity to our claims reserving process and therefore adds uncertainty to our claims reserve estimates as the reporting of information  the setting of initial reserves and the loss settlement process for these lines of business vary from our traditional property catastrophe line of business 
for our reinsurance and individual risk operations  our estimates of claims reserves include case reserves reported to us as well as our estimate of appropriate additional case reserves and ibnr 
our case reserves  additional case reserves  and our estimates for ibnr reserves are based on claims reports from insureds and program managers  our underwriters experience in setting claims reserves  the use of computer models where applicable  and historical industry claims experience 
for some classes of business we also use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
we review our claims reserves on a regular basis

during  our capital resources decreased by million primarily as a result of our net loss of million  dividends paid to our common and preferred shareholders of million and million  respectively  and a reduction in our net unrealized gains on investments of million 
in march  we raised million through the issuance of million series c preference shares  in february  we raised million through the issuance of million series b preference shares  and in november  we raised million through the issuance of million series a preference shares 
the series c  series b and series a preference shares may be redeemed at per share at our option on or after march   february  and november   respectively  however  we have no current intentions to redeem the shares 
dividends on the series c  series b and series a preference shares are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at  and  respectively  when  if  and as declared by the board of directors 
if renaissancere submits a proposal to our shareholders concerning an amalgamation or submits any proposal that  as a result of any changes to bermuda law  requires approval of the holders of renaissancere preference shares to vote as a single class  renaissancere may redeem the series c  series b and series a preference shares prior to march   february  and november   respectively  at per share 
the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any other of our securities 
in january  we issued million of senior notes due february   with interest on the notes payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  in july  we issued million of senior notes due july  with interest on the notes payable on january and july of each year 
the notes can be redeemed by us prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium  however  we have no current intentions of calling the notes 
the notes  which are senior obligations  contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restrictions as to the disposition of stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens on the stock of designated subsidiaries 
renaissancere was in compliance with the related covenants at december  and our capital trust has issued capital securities which pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
during and  renaissancere did not repurchase any of the capital securities 
renaissancere has repurchased an aggregate million of the capital securities since their issuance in the sole asset of the capital trust consists of our junior subordinated debentures 
the indenture relating to these junior subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a covenant prohibiting us from the payment of dividends if we are in default under the indenture 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture at december  and the capital securities mature on march  during may  davincire amended and restated its credit agreement to extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility established thereunder from may  to may  all other material terms and conditions in the credit agreement remained the same 
the credit agreement provides for a million committed revolving credit facility  the full amount of which was drawn in and remains outstanding 
neither renaissancere nor renaissance reinsurance is a guarantor of this facility and the lenders have no recourse against us or our subsidiaries other than davincire and its subsidiary under the davincire facility 
pursuant to the terms of the million revolving credit facility maintained by renaissancere  a default by davincire on its obligations will not result in a default under the renaissancere facility 
interest rates on the facility are based on a spread above libor  and averaged approximately during 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants requiring davincire to maintain a debt to capital ratio of or below and a minimum net worth of million 
at december  and  davincire was in compliance with the covenants under this agreement 
the term of the credit facility may be further extended and the size of the facility may be increased to million if certain conditions are met 
the company is currently discussing a potential increase to the size of this facility with its bank group 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and joint ventures may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our principal letter of credit facility is a syndicated secured facility which accepts as collateral shares issued by our subsidiary rihl 
our participating operating subsidiaries and our managed joint ventures have pledged and must maintain as pledged rihl shares issued to them with a sufficient collateral value to support their respective obligations under the facility  including reimbursement obligations for outstanding letters of credit 
the participating subsidiaries and joint ventures have the option to post alternative forms of collateral 
in addition  for liquidity purposes  in order to be permitted to pledge rihl shares as collateral  each participating subsidiary and joint venture must maintain additional unpledged rihl shares that have a net asset value at least equal to of its facility usage  and rihl shares having an aggregate net asset value equal to at least of the net asset value of all outstanding rihl shares must remain unencumbered 
in the case of a default under the facility  or in other circumstances in which the rights of our lenders to collect on their collateral may be impaired  the lenders may exercise certain remedies under the facility agreement  in accordance with and subject to its terms  including redemption of pledged shares and conversion of the collateral into cash or eligible marketable securities 
the redemption of shares by the collateral agent takes priority over any pending redemption of unpledged shares by us or other holders 
in march  the reimbursement agreement was amended to conform certain default provisions of the agreement to comparable provisions in existing credit agreements of the company and davincire  and in april  the term of this facility was extended through april  as a result of losses incurred in the third and fourth quarters of from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  the facility was increased from million to billion 
at february   we had  million of letters of credit with effective dates on or before december  outstanding under the facility and total letters of credit outstanding under all facilities of  million 
our subsidiary stonington has provided a letter of credit in the amount of million to one counterparty which is secured by cash and eligible marketable securities 
also  in connection with our top layer re joint venture  we have committed million of collateral to support a letter of credit and are obligated to make a mandatory capital contribution of up to million in the event that a loss reduces top layer re s capital below a specified level 
during august  we amended and restated our committed revolving credit agreement to increase the facility from million to million  to extend the term to august  and to make certain other changes 
the interest rates on this facility are based on a spread above libor 
on december   million was drawn under this facility and remains outstanding at december  no balance was outstanding at december  as amended  the agreement contains certain financial covenants 
these covenants generally provide that consolidated debt to capital shall not exceed the ratio the debt to capital ratio of and that the consolidated net worth the net worth requirements of renaissancere and renaissance reinsurance shall equal or exceed billion and million  respectively  subject to certain adjustments under certain circumstances in the case of the debt to capital ratio and certain grace periods in the case of the net worth requirements  all as more fully set forth in the agreement 
we have the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase the size of this facility to million 
in the fourth quarter of our consolidated joint venture  davincire  raised million of equity capital 
the capital was funded by new and existing investors  including million contributed by us 
in conjunction with the transaction  we modified the davincire shareholders agreement and provided new and existing shareholders with new rights 
the second amended and restated shareholders agreement provides davincire shareholders  excluding us  with certain redemption rights  which allow each shareholder to notify davincire of such shareholder s desire for davincire to repurchase up to half of such shareholder s aggregate number of shares held 
any share repurchases are subject to certain limitations  as described in the second amended and restated shareholders agreement  such as limiting the aggregate of all share repurchase requests to of davincire s capital in any given year and subject to ensuring all applicable regulatory requirements are met 
if the total shareholder requests exceed of davincire s capital  the number of shares repurchased will be reduced among the requesting shareholders pro rata  based on the amounts desired to be repurchased 
shareholders must notify davincire before march of each year  commencing march   if they desire to have davincire repurchase shares 
the repurchase price will be gaap book value as of the end of the year in which the shareholder notice is given  and the repurchase will be effective as of such date 
payment will be made as promptly as practicable in the following year  and adjusted as necessary following delivery of the audited financial statements for the year in which the repurchase was effective 
the repurchase price will be subject to adjustment in future periods for development on outstanding loss reserves after settlement of all claims relating to the applicable years 
our economic ownership interest in davincire was at december   down from prior to the capital raise 
subsequent to december   davincire raised an additional million of equity capital in february and our ownership has been reduced to 
we continue to maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  will continue consolidating the results of davincire into the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
credit ratings in november  following our announcement that our then chairman and chief executive officer had departed the company in light of the government investigations resulting from our restatement of our financial results  and in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  each of the major rating agencies downgraded our ratings and those of most of our principal operating subsidiaries  and placed our ratings and the rating of our principal operating subsidiaries on credit watch negative or the equivalent 
our ratings generally remain under review with negative implications with these agencies 
the current financial strength ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries are set forth under ratings 
these ratings are not evaluations directed to investors in our securities or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our securities 
our ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agencies 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance remain among the highest in our business  these ratings actions could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
moreover  if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  moody s or standard poor s  we believe our competitive position in the insurance industry would suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings 
we can not give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a further downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
shareholders equity during  shareholders equity decreased by million to billion at december   from billion at december  the significant components of the change in shareholders equity included the net loss attributable to common shareholders of million  a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of million and dividends to our common shareholders of million 
in the future  we may return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases 
in august  the board authorized a share repurchase program of million 
this amount includes the remaining amounts available under prior authorizations 
during  million of shares were repurchased under this program 
no shares were repurchased under the program in in the future  we may purchase shares under our current authorization  or increase the size of our repurchase program 
any such determination will be subject to market conditions and other factors 
in august  the company s shareholders approved the renaissancere holdings ltd 
stock option incentive plan the premium option plan under which  common shares were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options granted under the premium option plan 
as described in the company s proxy statement relating to the required shareholder vote  filed with the sec in july  the premium option plan provides for  among other things  mandatory premium pricing such that options can generally only be issued thereunder with a strike price at a minimum of of the fair market value on the date of grant  minimum year cliff vesting  and no discretionary repricing 
the premium option plan includes a dividend protection feature that reduces the strike price for extraordinary dividends and a change in control feature that reduces the strike price based on a pre established formula in the event of change in control 
grantees under the premium option plan must satisfy performance criteria which is determined by the company s compensation committee 
as at december    options were outstanding under the premium option plan with an average exercise price of per share  and  options were outstanding with an exercise price of per share 
investments at december   we held investments totaling billion  compared to billion in the table below shows the aggregate amounts of our invested assets

the million growth in our portfolio of invested assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of million  and net cash provided by financing activities of million which is net of dividends to common and preference shareholders of million and million  respectively  and a million reduction in net unrealized gains on our available for sale investments 
because our coverages include substantial protection for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we may become liable for substantial claim payments on short notice 
accordingly  our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity 
the large majority of our investment portfolio consists of highly rated fixed income securities  including us treasuries  highly rated sovereign and supranational securities  high grade corporate securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
we also hold a significant amount of short term investments 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
as of december  we had  million of short term investments compared to million as of december  at december   our invested asset portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments had a dollar weighted average rating of aa aa  an average duration of years years and an average yield to maturity of 
as noted in our discussion of our cash flows above  our future cash flows from operations will be negatively impacted by losses we will be required to pay related to the large catastrophes 
the equity investments in reinsurance company relate to our november  purchase of  common shares of platinum in a private placement transaction 
in addition  we received a year warrant to purchase up to million additional common shares of platinum for per share 
we purchased the common shares and warrant for an aggregate price of million 
on december   we sold all of our common shares of platinum for total proceeds of million and recorded a realized gain of million 
we have recorded our investment in the warrant at fair value  and at december  the aggregate fair value was million million 
the fair value of the warrant is estimated by us using the black scholes option pricing model 
during the fourth quarter of  a lockup provision on the warrant expired and as a result the warrant met the definition of a derivative under fas and  therefore  changes in the fair value of the warrant were recorded prospectively in other income from november at december   million million of cash and cash equivalents and investments were invested in currencies other than the us dollar  which represented of our cash and cash equivalents and invested assets 
we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency denominated cash and investments back to us dollars by either matching these non us denominated assets with liabilities denominated in the same currency or through the use of foreign currency derivative contracts 
a portion of our investment assets are directly held by our subsidiary rihl  a bermuda company we organized for the primary purpose of holding the investments in high quality marketable securities for renaissancere  our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint venture affiliates 
we believe that rihl permits us to consolidate and substantially facilitate our investment management operations and facilitates posting of letters of credit 
each rihl share is redeemable for cash or in marketable securities 
over time  the participants in rihl are expected to both subscribe for additional shares and redeem outstanding shares  as our and their respective liquidity needs change 
renaissancere and each of our participating operating subsidiaries and affiliates have transferred to rihl marketable securities or other assets  in return for a subscription of rihl equity interests 
each rihl share is redeemable by the subscribing companies for cash or in marketable securities

as of december  our hedge funds were engaged in various investment strategies  including diversified arbitrage  distressed  us long short  sector long short and energy trading with original capital contributed by us  generally in the range of million to million per fund  although we have invested up to million in one hedge fund 
the private equity partnerships are primarily engaged in us private equity  real estate  distressed securities and secondary investment strategies with initial capital commitments ranging from million to million 
the loan fund primarily invests in senior secured floating rate loans 
the european high yield credit fund is denominated in euros and primarily invests in unlisted and listed fixed and floating rate debt securities issued by entities that are domiciled in or have a substantial portion of their total assets or operations in a european country 
the medium term note was issued by an investment company which invests predominantly in investment grade european fixed income securities and passes through a variable us dollar return on the note based on the performance of the underlying securities 
the non us convertible fund is denominated in euros and primarily invests in unlisted and listed non us convertible securities 
included in miscellaneous other investments are catastrophe bonds  that generally include variable rate notes where the return is contingent upon climatical or geological events 
fair values of certain of the other investments noted above are generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of the investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit the company s ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
interest income  income distributions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments are included in net investment income and totaled million million of which million million was related to net unrealized gains 
we have committed capital to private equity partnerships of million  of which million has been contributed at december  effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of this post event inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
off balance sheet and special purpose entity arrangements at december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of regulation s k 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  for all stock based employee compensation granted  modified or settled after january  under the prospective method described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas  we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and other stock based compensation on the date of grant and amortize this value as an expense over the service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this option valuation model upon the required adoption of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r effective january  because fas r must be applied not only to new awards but also to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  and because we adopted fas using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted  modified or settled after the adoption date  compensation costs for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under fas will be recognized under fas r 
we do not expect the additional compensation expense related to unvested grants that were issued prior to january  to have a material impact upon adoption of fas r 
had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the transitional disclosure provisions of fas in accordance with the transitional disclosure provisions of fas  the following table sets out the effect on our net loss income and loss earnings per share for all reported periods had the compensation cost been calculated based upon the fair value method recommended in fas

in accordance with fas  eps calculations use average common shares outstanding basic  when in a net loss position 
current outlook we currently anticipate the following developments in our business potential improvements in market conditions the insurance industry experienced substantial catastrophe losses in hurricane katrina is estimated to have resulted in a record level of insured property losses  and there has also been an aggregation of other catastrophic insured losses in  including hurricanes emily  rita and wilma  european windstorm erwin and flooding in several european cities 
these losses are on top of an active year in in which there were four major hurricanes that made landfall in florida 
these losses may increase perceptions of risk which could result in increased demand for  and reduced availability of  catastrophe exposed insurance and reinsurance 
the affected lines include catastrophe reinsurance and catastrophe exposed homeowner business  and also include other catastrophe exposed lines of business  such as offshore energy and large account commercial property 
we have also increased certain of our assumptions of catastrophe frequency  and we expect to seek higher nominal prices for catastrophe exposed business  although it remains unclear whether our margins will expand meaningfully  or whether our clients will be prepared to pay the increased prices 
we believe that we are well positioned to participate in the improving market environment 
however  various factors could constrain us  including i the possibility of a higher level of competition than currently anticipated  associated with the rapid movement of capital into the insurance and reinsurance sectors  which could result in a less attractive pricing environment  ii limitations on our growth or other adverse impacts arising from the recent downgrades of our various credit ratings see part i item capital resources credit ratings  and iii limitations on human or capital resources available to us 
reinsurance segment for we are projecting growth in our catastrophe gross premiums written compared to our catastrophe gross premiums written  excluding loss related premium 
in  we generated million of loss related premium as a result of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
we define loss related premium as reinstatement premiums written as a result of these large catastrophes  back up reinsurance coverage provided to companies to replace reinsurance protection lost following the large catastrophes  and reinsurance coverage provided to a company to cover a named hurricane 
if there is an absence of similar large catastrophic events during  we anticipate such premiums will not recur 
in our specialty unit  we are projecting a significant decline in gross premiums written for compared to our specialty gross premiums written  excluding loss related premium 
in we generated million in loss related premium 
our projected decline in specialty premium is due to several factors including the non renewal of one large contract in which the new owner fully retained the risk  clients in general retaining more risk  and our underwriters non renewing certain programs where the pricing and terms deteriorated to a point where we no longer found the programs attractive enough for us to write 
in general  our specialty premiums are attributable to a relatively small number of large contracts and the amount of specialty premium can fluctuate significantly between quarters and between years depending upon the number of  and nature of  the transactions which we complete 
individual risk segment we expect that our individual risk business will continue to grow into lines that are not catastrophe exposed  given programs that we have recently entered into as well as potential new opportunities  and are projecting growth in gross premiums written in this segment in new business we believe that the current market environment may create more opportunities for the creation of joint ventures and strategic investments 
we have established ventures to facilitate strategic investments 
we may consider opportunities in other areas of the insurance and reinsurance markets  or in other financial markets  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of other companies or books of business of other companies 
we are currently in the process of reviewing certain opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
government investigations the sec  the nyag  the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york  certain state insurance regulatory authorities and others are investigating various practices within the insurance industry  including contingent commission payments to brokers  alleged bid rigging  and steering  as well as the use of non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products 
government authorities are also currently investigating our restatement of the company s financial statements 
see legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework or our business 
management changes we announced on november  the resignation of mr 
stanard as chairman and ceo in light of the ongoing investigations resulting from our restatement of our financial results 
mr 
stanard s rights and obligations following his resignation are governed by his employment agreement and by our standard practices for senior expatriate executives principally relating to transitional period medical insurance  transitional travel from bermuda  and the purchase or return of company issued property 
upon his resignation on november   pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with us  mr 
stanard i vested in all options granted to him under the company s premium option plan  which options shall remain exercisable until the expiration of their stated term  subject to continued compliance with certain noncompetition obligations  and ii vested in all options and shares of restricted stock granted to him under the company s stock incentive plan and company s second amended and restated stock incentive plan  with options remaining exercisable for thirty days following his termination of employment 
we incurred an expense of million in the fourth quarter of due to the accelerated vesting of these options and shares 
mr 
stanard forfeits his options under the plan in the event that he competes with us prior to exercising such options 
we did not enter into a separation agreement with mr 
stanard  and mr 
stanard will not receive any other severance payments in connection with his departure 
this management change could have an adverse impact on our business  including on our current or prospective relationships with clients or joint venture partners 
on november   we also announced that chief operating officer and chief financial officer john m 
lummis has indicated that he intends to retire at the end of his contract term on june  we also announced on november   that neill a 
currie has been named by the board of directors as the new chief executive officer of the company and has also been appointed to the board of directors  effective immediately  and that mr 
macginnitie was appointed non executive chairman of the board of directors 
from july  until november   mr 
currie  age  served as executive vice president of the company  and was responsible for the company s specialty reinsurance business 
mr

private equity commitments do not have a defined contractual commitment date and we have therefore included them in the less than one year category

we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
in order to estimate the payment dates of our contractual obligations for our reserve for claims and claim expense  we have used the work of an actuarial firm 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
this firm has based its estimate of future claim payments upon benchmark payment patterns constructed internally  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
we believe that it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk  and credit risk 
the company s investment guidelines permit  subject to approval  investments in derivative instruments such as futures  options  foreign currency forward contracts and swap agreements  which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments  whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturity investments portfolio to fund operations  pay reinsurance and insurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in part by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience foreign exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
all changes in exchange rates  with the exception of non us dollar denominated investments classified as available for sale  are recognized currently in our statements of operations 
our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
when necessary  the company will use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
as of december   the company had notional exposure of million million related to foreign currency forward and option contracts purchased 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
during  we incurred a loss of million loss of million  on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our underwriting operations 
for our investment operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar bonds and euro denominated fixed income and other funds 
as of december   our combined investment in these bonds and funds was million million 
to hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these funds  we have entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts with notional exposure of million million 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non dollar investments 
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising from non us dollar investments classified as available for sale are recorded in other comprehensive income 
realized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar available for sale investments and foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of operations 
during  we recorded a gain of million loss of million on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our hedging of non us dollar investments 
this was offset by a loss of million gain of million on the underlying hedged foreign currency denominated investments  of which million million relates to available for sale securities and was therefore included in other comprehensive income loss and million million related to our other investments  which was included in net foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
equity risk we are exposed to equity price risk principally due to our investment in a warrant to purchase additional common shares of platinum see summary of results of operations for  and other investments  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value 
the risk is the potential for loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the price of platinum s common stock 
the aggregate fair value of this investment in platinum was million at december  a hypothetical percent decline in the price of platinum stock  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of the warrant assuming no other changes to the inputs to the black scholes option valuation model that we use 
the decline in the fair value of the warrant would be recorded in other income 
we are also indirectly exposed to equity market risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  and private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets 
such investments totaled million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the prices of these hedge funds and private equity partnerships  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of these investments at december  credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments available for sale  short term investments  premiums receivable and ceded reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time we purchase credit derivatives to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry and to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance 
at december   the maximum payments we were obligated to make under credit default swaps was million million 
we account for these credit derivatives at fair value and record them on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these credit derivatives  as recognized in other liabilities in our balance sheet  at december  was a liability of million million 
during  we recorded losses of million million in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates
