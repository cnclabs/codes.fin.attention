item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company  which from the commencement of operations in through  was focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow gulf of mexico shelf 
beginning in  we began diversifying our reserves and production with longer life onshore properties in texas and oklahoma  and we enhanced our risk management policies by reducing our average working interest in projects  shifting capital to higher probability onshore wells and reducing the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program 
in particular  in we acquired properties in the southeast carthage field in east texas with bcfe of proved reserves 
in  we entered the arkoma basin in oklahoma by building an acreage position  drilling wells and acquiring bcfe of proved reserves 
during  we increased our presence in oklahoma through multiple acquisition transactions and an expanded drilling program consisting of gross wells drilled 
in the carthage field we successfully drilled an additional wells during growing field production from by over 
in total  we drilled wells in longer life basins during  which represented of the total wells drilled by the company in through these focused diversification efforts  at december   approximately of our proved reserves were located in longer life basins as compared to at december  and at december  in terms of production diversification  during  of our production was derived from longer life basins versus during and virtually none in we seek to grow our proved reserves  production  cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of lower risk development and exploitation activities  higher risk and higher impact exploration activities and acquisitions 
we were successful in in achieving company records for proved reserves  production  cash flow from operating activities and net income 
during  we increased these operational and financial metrics by   and  respectively  from levels 
our record results were achieved by our ability to capitalize on another year of strong commodity prices which enabled us to substantially increase our capital expenditures 
during  we invested approximately million  a increase from  into our exploration  development and acquisition activities 
these 
table of contents investments yielded a success rate on a company record wells drilled and the consummation of several strategic acquisitions 
to provide capital for our acquisitions and to repay borrowings under our credit facilities for future liquidity  during we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
following the issuance of the notes we repaid and terminated our subordinated debt credit facility and in december we amended our bank credit facility increasing the borrowing base to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
declines in prices or reserves could result in a future write down of oil and gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 

table of contents because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute quantities that we are reasonably certain of recovering in future years 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the expected event does not occur  or the hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded on the income statement 
our hedges are specifically referenced to the nymex index prices we receive for our designated production 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex index prices and the posted prices we receive from the designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we choose to obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counterparties to those contracts 
because the counterparties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a literal market value  or what they would be willing to settle such contracts for as of the given date 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the sec issued an amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for sfas r 
this amendment changed the effective date to the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  accordingly  we adopted the standard during the first quarter of 
table of contents sfas r permits adoption using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date using the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards at the effective date related to awards granted prior to the effective date 
an alternate method  the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted the standard using the modified prospective method 
we plan to continue to compute the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model assuming a stock option forfeiture rate  based on historical activity  of  an expected term of six years  using the short cut method provided for in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and expected volatility computed using our historical stock price fluctuations on a weekly basis for a period of time equal to the expected term of the option 
periodically we will adjust compensation expense based on the difference between actual and estimated forfeitures 
we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the principles prescribed by apb opinion no 
accordingly  no stock option compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  but will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the specific impact of the adoption cannot be predicted because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future and the differences between actual and estimated stock option forfeitures 
all of our stock options vest equally over a three year period 
therefore  at december   we had one year of compensation expense related to option grants and two years of compensation expense related to option grants that will be recognized in our income statement in and  using the accelerated expense attribution method 
based on options outstanding at december  and using an expected forfeiture rate  we would expect to recognize approximately  of share based compensation expense in and approximately  in in connection with the adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reflected as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we did not recognize any excess tax deductions during  or in connection with the exercise of stock options 
in september  the securities and exchange commission adopted sab no 
 regarding the application of sfas no 
by companies following the full cost accounting method 
sab no 
indicates that estimated future dismantlement and abandonment costs that are recorded on the balance sheet are to be included in the costs subject to the full cost ceiling limitation 
the estimated future cash outflows associated with settling the recorded asset retirement obligations should be excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues used in applying the ceiling test 
we began applying sab no 
in the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
year ended december  production oil bbls gas mcfe total production mcfe sales total oil sales total gas sales total oil and gas sales average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcfe per mcfe the above sales and average sales prices include reductions to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   and  and oil hedges of   and   for the years ended december   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the results were attributable to the following components production oil production in totaled  barrels  a decline from  while natural gas production increased to bcf from gas production of bcf 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
during  of our total production was natural gas as compared to during this shift towards natural gas is the result of our expanded operations in texas and oklahoma where the production is primarily natural gas 
the growth in production during was primarily the result of our increased capital expenditures  which included several acquisitions of producing properties and a increase in the number of gross wells drilled  as compared to offsetting our production gains were the shut in of a portion of our gulf coast basin fields during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita and the shut in of our main pass field throughout due to third party pipeline damage from hurricane ivan in production from main pass was restored in january based on our drilling success during and the restoration of production of main pass  we expect that our production will continue to grow during in addition  our production would benefit from any acquisition of producing properties that we would be successful in consummating during finally  we expect to drill approximately gross wells during  an increase from assuming we are able to maintain our historically high drilling success rate success rate over the last three years  our expanded drilling program should provide additional production growth 

table of contents prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  from  during as a result of higher commodity prices and increased production volumes 
assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we expect that our revenues would continue to increase as we expect to grow our production through drilling and strategic acquisitions of producing properties 
during  interest and other income totaled  as compared to  during the increase in is primarily due to income generated by our gas gathering assets acquired during and interest income earned on cash proceeds from the notes 
expenses lease operating expenses during increased to  as compared to  during on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe in  a increase from the per mcfe of operating costs in at december   we owned working interests in gross wells  as compared to gross wells at december  operating costs during were higher due to this significant increase in the number of producing wells in which we participate  as well as the increases in costs for oil field related services prevalent throughout the industry  such as labor  transportation  insurance and materials 
we expect the trend of higher operating costs to continue during  particularly with respect to insurance 
there have been substantial insurance claims made by the oil and gas industry as a result of hurricane damages incurred during in the gulf coast basin 
accordingly  we expect a significant increase in our insurance costs relative to our offshore operations  and are currently in discussions with our insurance underwriters regarding our options on deductibles  limits and specific coverages for see risk factors losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
at december   we recorded a million receivable representing our estimate of costs incurred to repair hurricane related damages through year end that we believed qualified for insurance reimbursement 
we estimate that our insurance claim related to hurricane damages attributable to our interests will ultimately total between million and million  assuming actual costs of remaining repairs approximate estimates 
production taxes increased to  during from  during production taxes in texas and oklahoma are predominately value based and therefore fluctuate in relation to commodity prices 
as a result  the increase in production taxes is primarily due to higher commodity prices coupled with increased production from our oklahoma and onshore texas properties 
additionally  effective july   there was an increase to the louisiana gas severance tax rate that contributed to the increase in production taxes 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increase in our staffing level during in order to accommodate our increased operational activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in on an mcfe basis  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the increase in our dd a expense per mcfe is primarily due to increased costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
as a result of the increased demand for oil and gas properties  equipment and services caused by high commodity prices  relative to historical averages  we expect this trend to continue 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated assets  totaled  during versus  during the increase in interest expense is the result of the higher debt level and interest rate associated with the notes  as well as a charge during of  related to previously deferred financing costs  primarily associated 
table of contents with our subordinated debt credit facility  which were written off 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is primarily due to the higher operating profit during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  and state income taxes 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results are attributable to the following components production oil production in totaled  barrels  a increase from the year ended december  natural gas production in increased to bcf from gas production of bcf 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
the increase in production as compared to was the result of our current year drilling success  which included only one dry hole out of wells drilled  and our acquisition of primarily gas producing properties in the southeast carthage field in december  which contributed bcfe  or  to our net production 
prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  from  during as a result of higher production volumes and commodity prices 
during  interest and other income decreased to  from  during interest and other income recognized during included the settlement of a lawsuit 
expenses as a result of the increase in the number of wells we participate in  lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during however  on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production taxes increased to  during from  during the increase is due to higher onshore production as a result of acquisitions in texas and oklahoma  as well as an increase in the louisiana severance tax rate effective july  general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to higher accrued bonuses in resulting from the company s improved performance in relative to depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in on an mcfe basis  however  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the decrease in per unit dd a was due primarily to acquisitions made during late and throughout at a lower per unit cost than our historical depletion rate and our drilling success 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  totaled  during versus  during the increase in interest costs is the result of borrowings made in december to fund the 
table of contents acquisition of properties in the carthage field and borrowings made in october to fund the acquisition of properties in oklahoma 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
derivative expense totaled  and  during and  respectively 
the expense recorded in was the result of an ineffective gas derivative instrument and an interest rate swap that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these instruments expired during december and november  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is due to the increase in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of common stock and debt securities and sales of properties 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations increased from  during to  in at december   we had a working capital deficit of  versus a deficit of  at december  the increase in our current assets at december  was primarily due to an increase in our revenue and joint interest billing receivables 
the increase in the revenue receivable was due to higher production and prices at year end while our joint interest billing receivable increased as a result of the substantial increase in drilling and operational activity during the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments  a result of higher estimated future commodity prices  and an increase in our accounts payable to vendors  which is a function of increased operational activity 
overall  our accounts receivable and accounts payable at december  increased as a result of higher capital expenditures  production and commodity prices realized during we believe that our working capital balance should be viewed in conjunction with availability of borrowings under our bank credit facility when measuring liquidity 
source of capital debt on may   we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due at of their face value 
on june   we issued an additional million in principal amount of senior notes due at of their face value 
after payment of expenses and the initial purchasers discounts  we received million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities  to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
the notes are redeemable at our option beginning on may  at of their principal amount and thereafter declining annually to on and after may  in addition  before may   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued with net proceeds from an equity offering at 
the notes provide for certain covenants  which include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on may and november at december   million had been accrued in connection with the may  interest payment 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the notes 
we entered into a million bank credit facility on may  during the second quarter of  we repaid all outstanding borrowings under this credit facility with a portion of the net proceeds received from the issuance of the notes 
on november   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  petroquest energy  llc  entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as lender  agent and issuer of letters of credit  macquarie bank limited  as lender  and calyon new york branch  as lender and syndication agent 
the credit agreement  which was amended in december  provides for a million revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow amounts from time to time based on the available borrowing base as determined in the credit facility 
the credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on november  
table of contents the credit facility is secured by  among other things  a lien on at least of the pdp present value and at least of the aggregate proved reserves of our oil and gas properties 
pdp present value means the present value discounted at nine percent of the future net revenues attributable to producing reserves 
the borrowing base under the credit facility is based upon the valuation as of january and july of each year of our mortgaged oil and gas properties and any other credit factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
the borrowing base is currently million with no reductions scheduled to occur prior to the first borrowing base re determination  which is scheduled to occur by april  we or the lenders may request additional borrowing base re determinations 
outstanding balances on the credit facility bear interest at either the alternate base rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to based on borrowing base usage or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the alternate base rate is equal to the higher of the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  and the eurodollar rate is equal to the applicable british bankers association libor rate for deposits in us dollars 
outstanding letters of credit will be charged a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for advances at the eurodollar rate 
the company is subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility  including a maximum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to annualized consolidated ebitda  determined on a rolling four quarter basis of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility also includes customary restrictions with respect to liens  indebtedness  loans and investments  material changes in the company s business  asset sales or leases or transfers of assets  restricted payments such as distributions and dividends  mergers or consolidations  transactions with affiliates and rate management transactions 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants therein 
on november   we obtained a million second lien term credit facility from macquarie americas corp  which was subsequently assigned to macquarie bank limited mbl 
on may   we repaid the million of total borrowings outstanding with a portion of the net proceeds from the notes and terminated this facility 
after termination of this facility  however  certain oil and gas hedging contracts with mbl as the counterparty remained in place and are secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the oil and gas properties of petroquest energy  llc until the hedges expire or are terminated 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  other than under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 
source of capital issuance of securities during april  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of tdc energy  inc  an independent oil and gas company with properties in the gulf coast basin 
use of capital exploration and development we have an exploration and development program budget for that will require significant capital 
our capital budget for is expected to range from million to million 
based on our outlook of commodity prices and estimated production  we believe that cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional borrowings from banks or other lenders  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total bank debt senior notes purchase obligations operating leases capital projects includes principal and estimated interest 
consists of a three year commitment for the rental of a drilling rig and a commitment to acquire seismic data during consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for equipment rentals 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our leased properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we paid the counterparties to our derivative instruments approximately million in connection with hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge
