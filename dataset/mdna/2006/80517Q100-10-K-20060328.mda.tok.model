overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in both niche and wider markets 
we currently market one product  oxandrin  used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we also have one product in clinical development  puricase peg uricase  intended for the treatment of gout 
we are currently engaged in a repositioning of our company to focus on the full development of puricase peg uricase  our product candidate for the control of hyperuricemia in patients with symptomatic gout in whom conventional treatment is contraindicated or shown to be ineffective 
puricase peg uricase is expected to begin phase clinical dosing by may we also market more than pharmaceutical products in oral liquid form through our subsidiary rosemont pharmaceuticals limited 
in february we announced that we have engaged investment bankers and are exploring strategic alternatives for rosemont  including the potential spin out or sale of the business 
during july  we sold our former global biologics manufacturing business which was primarily operated in israel through our former bio technology general israel ltd 
subsidiary btg israel 
we were founded in as bio technology general corp 
to develop  manufacture and market novel therapeutic products 
we coordinate our overall administration  finance  business development  human clinical trials  us sales and marketing activities  quality assurance and regulatory affairs primarily from our headquarters in east brunswick  new jersey 
we carry out the development  manufacture  distribution and sale of our oral liquid pharmaceutical products through rosemont in the united kingdom 
our financial results have been heavily dependent on oxandrin since we introduced it in december sales of oxandrin accounted for of our net product sales in  of our net product sales in and of our net product sales in we believe several companies have filed andas with the fda relating to a generic drug with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as oxandrin 
although we cannot predict when generic competition for oxandrin may begin  the fda may approve one or more generic versions of oxandrin at any time 
the introduction of these generic products would likely cause a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which would adversely affect us financially and could require us to scale back some of our business activities 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
on january   we completed our sale to indevus pharmaceuticals inc of our product delatestryl 
under the terms of the sale  indevus paid us an initial payment of million  subject to adjustment based on outstanding trade inventory  and will pay us a portion of the net sales of the product for the first three years following closing of the transaction based on an escalating scale 
additionally  indevus purchased from us in three installments equaling approximately million our inventory of finished product 
prior to the sale  
back to contents sales of delatestryl had decreased significantly as a result of the fda s allowance of the reintroduction of a generic version of delatestryl into the market in march rosemont s product sales represented a larger percentage of our overall product sales in than they did in and rosemont s product sales accounted for of our net product sales in  of our net product sales in and of our net product sales in in order to focus our full efforts and resources on the full development of our product candidate puricase peg uricase  in february  we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for rosemont  including the potential spin out or sale of the business

the sources of revenue under our historical third party arrangements included up front contract fees  funding for additional research  and reimbursement for producing certain experimental materials  milestone payments and royalties on sales of product 
our funding for additional research conducted by our former btg israel subsidiary includes funding that we historically received from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel 
following the sale of our israeli business operations  the revenue from the historical third party arrangements and future funding from the office of the chief scientist is not available to us 

back to contents our revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  including generic products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions 
the following table summarizes net sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands continuing operations oxandrin oral liquid pharmaceutical products delatestryl discontinued operations human growth hormone biolon other we believe that our product performance will vary from period to period based on the purchasing patterns of our customers  particularly related to wholesaler inventory management trends  and our focus on maintaining or increasing business with our existing product  expanding into new markets  and commercializing additional products

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales varies from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the quantity and mix of products sold and the magnitude of the reserves for product returns and rebates 
oxandrin has relatively low manufacturing costs relative to their sales prices  whereas delatestryl had  and rosemont s products have  higher manufacturing costs relative to their sales prices 
amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of rosemont  we recorded intangibles of  consisting of trademarks  patents and developed products

we recorded  of amortization of these intangibles in each of  and commissions and royalties in decreased by  or  to  from  in commissions and royalties in increased by  or  from  in the decrease in was primarily attributable to reduced commissions paid to the ross products division of abbott laboratories  or ross  on sales of oxandrin for the long term care market and a decrease in royalties that we were required to pay for our delatestryl products and former mircette products due to a decrease in the sales of those products 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased commissions paid to ross 
other income expense  net in was  of other income during as compared to  of other expense during  and  of other income during the other income in primarily related to the net proceeds of approximately million received in the settlement of the mircette patent rights royalties in connection with the settlement of the patent infrigement litgation 
other income  net during also included the successful settlement of an intellectual property litigation with novo nordisk for million

in  other income  net was primarily attributable to investment and finance income 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes for decreased  or  to  from  in provision for income taxes in increased  or  from  for the decrease in and the increase in provision for income taxes in was primarily attributable to the recording of a valuation allowance as of december  to reflect the uncertainty of our being able to use the benefits of our deferred tax assets in the future based upon our current business outlook and the change in our strategic direction 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our working capital was  as compared to  as of december  the increase in working capital as of december  was primarily attributable to an increase in our cash position and decrease in debt 
our cash flows have fluctuated significantly as a result of changes in our revenues  operating expenses  capital spending  working capital requirements  the issuance of common stock and other financing activities  as well as proceeds received from the sale of our former global biologics manufacturing business and certain litigation settlements 
we expect that cash flows in the near future will be primarily determined by the levels of our net income  working capital requirements and financings  if any  that we may undertake 
net cash increased by  in and increased by  in and  in net cash provided by operating activities was  in   in  and  in net income was  in  compared to a net loss of  in  compared to a net income of  in in net cash provided by operating activities was  during the same period that we had a net income of  this difference was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventories  net of  a decrease in accounts receivables  net of  proceeds from the sales of short term investments of  and non cash charges for depreciation of  and amortization of intangible assets of  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  a decrease in other current liabilities of  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  in addition  net income in included proceeds from the mircette litigation settlement of approximately  and from the novo nordisk litigation settlement of  in net cash provided by operating activities was  during the same period that we sustained a net loss of  this difference is primarily attributable to the decrease in accounts receivable of  a decrease in accounts payable of  as well as non cash charges for deferred income taxes of  deferred revenue of  depreciation of

debt payments were   and  during   and  respectively 
we repaid long term debt in connection with our divestiture of our former global biologics manufacturing business 
in and rosemont improved its manufacturing facility to obtain fda approval to enable rosemont to manufacture oral liquid soltamox tamoxifen for supply into the us market  at a total cost of approximately million 
we believe that our cash sources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may fail to achieve our anticipated liquidity levels as a result of unexpected events or failure to achieve our goals 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the timing and amount of product sales  particularly our continued ability to sell oxandrin prior to the introduction of generic versions of the product  continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly with respect to puricase peg uricase  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  including regulatory approvals for puricase peg uricase  and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop in the future and regulatory approval to enable rosemont to manufacture oral liquid pharmaceutical products for supply into the us market  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the quality and timeliness of the performance of our third party suppliers and distributors  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the outcome of pending purported class action and other related  or potentially related  actions and the litigation costs with respect to such actions  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements 

back to contents if we are required to seek additional funding for our operations  we might not be able to obtain such additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding might be on unacceptable terms 
we continue to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered 
however  we may not be able to enter into any such agreements 
additionally  on february  we announced the engagement of citigroup corporate and investment banking to explore strategic alternatives for our wholly owned subsidiary  rosemont  including the potential spin out or sale of the business and also announced our intention  upon the completion of a rosemont transaction  to earmark a significant portion of the net proceeds for a stock repurchase plan 
however  there can be no assurance that a rosemont transaction will be completed

we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results product revenue recognition 
product sales are recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
together  sab  and fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas no 
states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller 
back to contents and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to and twelve months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following three products product expiration in years oxandrin mg oxandrin mg delatestryl oxandrin mg dosage was approved for year expiration dating during for the period ending december  this product dosage was sold with year expiration dating 
upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we will provide additional return reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
certain specifics regarding these analyses are as follows actual return rates we track actual returns by product and analyzes historical return trends 
we use these historical trends as part of our overall process of estimating future returns 
the level of product manufactured the level of product produced has an impact on the valuation of that product 
for productions that exceed anticipated future demand  a valuation adjustment will be required 
generally  this valuation adjustment occurs as an offset to gross inventory 
during  the valuation adjustment also impacted return reserves since product entered the channel with expiration dating that was below our then standard of ten months before expiration 
currently  we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the channel 
level of product in the distribution channel from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  we followed the practice of offering customers quarter end promotions and pricing incentives with specified maximum purchases to ensure that supplies in the distribution channel would be sufficient to avoid stock outs 
analyses have shown that  although these quarter end promotions caused wholesaler buying spikes  the channel was not inflated 
based upon our review of the wholesaler inventory and third party prescription data that were and are available to us  the level of product in the channel is at a reasonable level at an average of approximately three months or less 
given the twelve month shipping policy  the level of product in the distribution channel appears reasonable for both five year and two year expiration product 
estimated shelf life product returns generally occur due to product expiration 
therefore  it is important for us to ensure that product sold into the channel has excess dating that will allow the product to be sold through the channel without nearing its expiration date 
currently we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the channel 
we have taken the appropriate measures to enforce this policy  including setting up certain controls with our third party distributor 
in addition  we entered into a distributor service agreement with one of our large wholesalers which limits the level of product at the wholesaler 
the terms of this agreement are consistent with the industry s movement toward a fee for service approach which we believe has resulted in better channel inventory management  higher levels of channel transparency  and more 
back to contents consistent buying and selling patterns 
since a majority of our sales flow through three large wholesalers  we expect that these industry changes will have a direct impact on our future sales to wholesalers  inventory management  product returns and estimation capabilities 
current and projected demand we analyze prescription demand data provided by industry standard third party sources 
this data is used to estimate the level of product in the channel and to determine future sales trends 
product launches and new product introductions for future product launches  we will analyze projected product demand and production levels in order to estimate return and inventory reserve allowances 
new product introductions  including generics  will be monitored for market erosion and adjustments to return estimates will be made accordingly 
we also utilize the guidance provided in sfas no 
and sab in establishing our return estimates 
sfas no 
discusses potential factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including the susceptibility of the product to significant external factors  such as technological obsolescence or changes in demand  relatively long periods in which a particular product may be returned  absence of historical experience with similar types of sales of similar products  or inability to apply such experience because of changing circumstances  for example  changes in the selling enterprise s marketing policies or relationships with its customers  and absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
sab provides additional factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including significant increases in or excess levels of inventory in a distribution channel sometimes referred to as channel stuffing  lack of visibility into or the inability to determine or observe the levels of inventory in a distribution channel and the current level of sales to end users  expected introductions of new products that may result in the technological obsolescence of and larger than expected returns of current products  the significance of a particular distributor to the registrant s or a reporting segment s business  sales and marketing  the newness of a product  the introduction of competitors products with superior technology or greater expected market acceptance  and other factors that affect market demand and changing trends in that demand for the registrant s products

see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for an annual roll forward of these reserve balances 
allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjusts the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience

see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for an annual roll forward of these reserve balances 
inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost using the weighted average method 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
the aggregate net inventory valuation reserves as of december    and were   and  respectively 
our inventories include oxandrin inventories that we believe would potentially be in excess of expected product demand if the fda approves a generic form of the product in the near term 
the amount of such potential excess will vary depending upon the timing of the approval of a generic product  the number of generic products that are approved and the rate by which generic sales reduce demand for branded oxandrin 
see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for an annual roll forward of these reserve balances 

back to contents accounts receivable 
we extend credit to customers based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
we generally do not require collateral from our customers when we extend credit 
accounts receivable are usually due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we assess the need for an allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to recovery of accounts written off 
during  and  we primarily sold to wholesalers of which three large wholesalers accounted for approximately  and of total sales respectively 
in general  we have experienced minimal collection issues with these large customers 
during  the company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts provision of approximately  primarily related to certain aged receivable balances that are currently being pursued for collection 
these balances generally represent the aggregation of miscellaneous disputes and thus it was determined that complete collection cannot be assured 
during  our allowance for doubtful accounts provision related only to our international operations and was not material 
at december  the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts was  see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for an annual roll forward reserve balance 
intangible assets acquired 
in september  we acquired rosemont 
we allocated the aggregate purchase price of  based on the estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired  which was based on an independent appraisal and information available at the time of the acquisition 
the intangible assets acquired consist of developed products  trademarks and several patents and are being amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful life of approximately years 
goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of rosemont  we recorded  of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier  if indicators of potential impairment exist  based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of rosemont with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of rosemont 
if the estimated fair value of rosemont is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of rosemont is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of rosemont 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for rosemont s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for rosemont  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of rosemont 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we have adopted a policy to review rosemont for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward looking information regarding market share  revenues and costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result  changes in these assumptions and current working capital could materially change the outcome of rosemont s fair value determinations in future periods  which could require a permanent write down of goodwill 
investments 
from time to time  we invest in non marketable equity securities for strategic purposes 
these investments are carried at cost 
we periodically monitor the liquidity  progress and financing activities of these entities to determine if impairment write downs are required 
in we wrote down our investment in marco by  and our investment in omrix by  income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of capital loss  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 

back to contents based upon our current business outlook and the change in our strategic direction  the likelihood of our being able to fully realize our deferred income tax benefits against future income became uncertain 
accordingly  as of december   we had a  valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
litigation 
on december   a purported shareholder class action was filed against us and three of our former officers 
the action is pending under the caption in re bio technology general corp 
securities litigation  in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
plaintiff alleges violations of sections b and a of the exchange act and seeks unspecified compensatory damages 
the plaintiff purports to represent a class of shareholders who purchased shares of the company between april  and august  the complaint asserts that certain of our financial statements were materially false and misleading because we restated our earnings and financial statements for the years ended  and  as described in our current report on form k dated  and our press release issued  on august  five nearly identical actions were filed in january and february  in each instance claiming unspecified compensatory damages 
in september the actions were consolidated and co lead plaintiffs and co lead counsel were appointed in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act 
the parties subsequently entered into a stipulation which provided for the lead plaintiff to file an amended consolidated complaint 
plaintiffs filed such amended complaint and we filed a motion to dismiss the action 
in august  citing the failure of the amended complaint to set forth particularized facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with the required state of mind  the court granted our motion to dismiss the action  without prejudice  and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
in october  the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint  again seeking unspecified compensatory damages  purporting to set forth particularized facts to support their allegations of violations of sections b and a of the exchange act by us and our former officers 
in december we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint 
we intend to continue its vigorous defense against plaintiffs allegations in this matter 
in october we received a letter addressed to the board of directors from attorneys for a purported stockholder demanding that we commence legal proceedings to recover unspecified damages against directors who served on our board immediately prior to our annual meeting  fulbright jaworski llp  arthur andersen llp  the partners of arthur andersen llp responsible for the audit of our financial statements for  and  as well as all other officers and directors responsible for the alleged wrongdoing 
the letter asserted that some or all of these persons were responsible for the material overstatement of our assets  earnings and net worth  and that these persons caused us to disseminate false and misleading press releases and filings with the sec 
an advisory committee to the board of directors  consisting of directors who were not directors prior to the annual meeting  investigated this demand and determined that litigation should not be commenced 
we have referred these claims to our directors and officers insurance carrier  which has reserved its rights as to coverage with respect to this action 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically assess impairments of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the factors that we consider include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above impairment indicators  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of these expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is equal to the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology
