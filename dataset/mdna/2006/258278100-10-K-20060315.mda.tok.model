approximately of the company s products are sold under its brand names and the remainder are sold for resale under customers private labels  other brands or in bulk

through its scan tech and hermoff subsidiaries  the company is increasing its international distribution of automotive replacement parts  with sales into canada  europe  the middle east and the far east 
the automotive aftermarket in which the company competes has been growing in size  however  the market continues to consolidate 
as a result  the company s customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with the company 
while the company does its best to avoid such concessions  in some cases payment terms to customers have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns and more favorable pricing primarily affect the company s profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
management expects both of these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company has focused on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as its primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for the company 
the company has invested heavily in resources necessary for it to increase its new product development efforts and to strengthen its relationships with its customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources and awareness programs  customer service improvements and increased customer credits and allowances 
this has enabled the company to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow its revenues 
page of the company may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in its results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by the company s customers

the consolidated results include hermoff since june  the company has not presented pro forma results of operations for the years ended december   december  and december   assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the respective periods  as these results would not have been materially different than actual results for the periods 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of the company s accounts receivable has been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
the company s five largest customers accounted for of net accounts receivable as of december  and december  a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and operating results 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million as of december  and december revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
the company records estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods page of sold 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
reserves for customer credits were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
management must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
the company provides reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
the company maintains contact with its customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of its products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserve needs as needed 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
goodwill 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company employs a discounted cash flow analysis and a market comparable approach in conducting its impairment tests 
cash flows are discounted at and an earnings multiple of to times ebitda is used when conducting these tests 
the company has completed the impairment tests required by sfas no 
 which did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
income taxes 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
the company must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine its current provision for income taxes and also its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  its interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or management s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management s assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render management s current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause the company s actual income tax obligations to differ from its estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
percentage of net sales year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income page of fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues in were up primarily as a result of continued growth in new product sales 
an additional week s sales in and the june acquisition of hermoff accounted for approximately of the sales growth 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in the primary reasons for the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales were a continued mix shift toward lower margin automotive hard parts and a million increase in the provision for excess and slow moving inventory reserves in selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million 
the expense increase was the result of inflationary cost increases  an increase in variable operating expenses due to sales volume growth and the company s decision to invest more resources in new product development which resulted in higher spending for product management  purchasing  engineering and quality control in during  the company also increased the use of its accounts receivable sale facilities 
financing costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable are recorded as operating expenses and amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall borrowing rates in the primary reason for the lower borrowing rates was a reduction in the outstanding principal of the company s senior notes  which was replaced with revolving credit borrowings at a lower interest rate 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in from in due to the loss of certain state tax benefits in as a result of changes in state tax legislation and lower earnings from the company s swedish subsidiary where tax rates are lower than the statutory rate in the united states 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in this sales increase is primarily the result of new product introductions and year over year volume growth from products introduced in the prior year 
the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange resulted in a year over year increase in sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  remained essentially flat at in compared to in the favorable effect of a change in sales mix was offset by approximately million in incremental expediting costs incurred to maintain satisfactory customer fill rates in the second half of as a result of material shortages for certain items and higher than planned demand 
overall material costs were down slightly in  although the company experienced price increases in several product lines in the second half of the year as a result of raw materials price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million 
the expense increase was at a slower rate than sales as many of the company s operating expenses are fixed in nature and therefore did not increase in proportion to sales growth 
the increase in expenses was the result of inflationary cost increases  an increase in variable operating expenses due to the sales volume growth and further investments by the company in its new product development capabilities 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels in the primary reason for the lower borrowing levels in was a reduction in the outstanding principal of the company s senior notes 
in august  the company made the third of seven annual installment payments of million due under the terms of its senior note agreements 
this installment payment was funded with cash on hand rather than new debt 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in from in as a result of higher incremental tax rates on s higher earnings level 
page of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through its bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
at december   working capital was million  total long term debt including the current portion and revolving credit borrowings was million and shareholders equity was million 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  totaled million 
over the past several years the company has extended payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
the company participates in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow it to sell its accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
as of december  and december   respectively  the company had sold million and million in accounts receivable under these programs and had removed them from its balance sheets 
the company expects continued pressure to extend its payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 
total capital spending in was million 
capital spending in is expected to be between and million 
long term debt consists primarily of million in senior notes that were originally issued in august  in a private placement on an unsecured basis notes 
the notes bear a fixed interest rate  payable quarterly 
annual principal payments of million are due each august through the notes require  among other things  that the company maintain certain financial covenants relating to debt to capital ratios and minimum net worth 
the company maintains a million revolving credit facility which expires in june borrowings under the amended facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
borrowings under the facility were million as of december  the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
the company s business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
the company has future obligations for debt repayments  future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term borrowings    operating leases    on january   the company entered into an industrial building lease with an unrelated party to rent  feet of additional warehouse and production space in portland  tn 
the initial lease term is for ten years 
the company may  at its option  terminate the lease without any further liability after seven years by giving the landlord six months notice and paying a termination fee 
total annual rent expense in the first year of the lease will be million 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than other commercial commitments committed year years years over years letters of credit   the company reported a net source of cash flow from its operating activities of million in fiscal net income and depreciation were the primary sources of operating cash flow in the primary uses of cash flow were inventory and accounts receivable 
inventory utilized million in cash in as a result inventory purchased to support new product initiatives and million of inventory placed on consignment to one customer in accounts receivable resulted in a net use of cash of million 
higher sales of accounts receivable under accounts receivable sales programs offset a portion of the accounts receivable impact of sales growth and the continued trend towards longer payment terms to certain customers 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal as a result of million in additions to property  plant and equipment and million in cash utilized to purchase hermoff 
the company s largest capital project is the automation and expansion of its central distribution center in warsaw  kentucky 
this project began in and was originally expected to be completed in early at a cost of million 
scope changes and other factors are now expected to delay completion of the project until the second quarter of  and total costs are now expected to be approximately million 
capital spending in also included tooling associated with new products  upgrades to information systems  purchases of equipment designed to improve operational efficiencies and scheduled equipment replacements 
financing activities generated million in cash in fiscal as proceeds of million from the company s amended revolving credit facility offset cash used to make the scheduled august repayment of million on the company s senior notes 
the company believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations together with its available sources of capital are sufficient to meet its ongoing cash needs for the foreseeable future 
foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of the company s products were purchased in a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  the company does not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
however  weakness in the dollar has resulted in some materials price increases and pressure from several foreign suppliers to increase prices further 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value to foreign currencies in the future or the present weakness in the dollar continues for a sustained period of time  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase further 
the company makes significant purchases of product from chinese vendors 
prior to  the chinese yuan exchange rate has been fixed against the us dollar since in july  the chinese government announced an immediate revaluation of the yuan against the us dollar and that going forward it will allow the yuan to fluctuate against a basket of currencies 
since that time the yuan has strengthened another against the us dollar 
most experts believe that the value of the yuan will increase further relative to the us dollar over the next few years 
such page of a move would most likely result in an increase in the cost of products that are purchased from china 
impact of inflation the company has experienced increases in the cost of materials and transportation costs as a result of raw materials shortages and commodity price increases in and increases in the cost of crude oil in these increases did not have a material impact on the company 
the company believes that further cost increases could potentially be mitigated by passing along price increases to customers or through the use of alternative suppliers or resourcing purchases to other countries  however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such efforts
