the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
general overview in november we completed the acquisition of the final two thirds interest in the coroc joint venture which owned nine factory outlet centers totaling approximately million square feet 
we originally purchased a one third interest in december from december to november  coroc was consolidated for financial reporting purposes under the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin r 
the purchase price for the final two thirds interest of coroc was million including closing and acquisition costs of million which we funded with a combination of unsecured debt and equity raised through the capital markets in the fourth quarter of at december   we had wholly owned centers in states totaling million square feet of gla compared to centers in states totaling million square feet of gla as of december  the changes in the number of centers and gla are due to the following events no 
of centers gla s states as of december  new development expansion locust grove  georgia foley  alabama dispositions seymour  indiana other as of december  results of operations compared to base rentals increased million  or  in the period compared to the period 
our overall occupancy rates were comparable from year to year at 
our base rental income increased million due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re tenanting vacant space 
during  we executed leases totaling million square feet at an average increase of 
this compares to our execution of leases totaling million square feet at an average increase of during base rentals also increased approximately  due to the expansions of our locust grove  georgia and foley  alabama centers which both occurred late in the fourth quarter of the impact of these increases was offset by decreases in the amortization of above or below market leases totaling  and decreases in termination fees received of  the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
for the period  we recorded  to rental income for the net amortization of market lease values compared with million for the period 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively 
percentage rentals  which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels the breakpoint  increased million or 
the percentage rents in were reduced by an allocation to the previous owner of the coroc portfolio for their pro rata share of percentage rents associated with tenants whose sales lease year began prior to december   the date of the initial acquisition 
reported same space sales per square foot for the twelve months ended december  were per square foot  a increase over the prior year ended december  same space sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period 
our ability to attract high volume tenants to many of our outlet centers continues to improve the average sales per square foot throughout our portfolio 
expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  insurance  property tax  promotional  advertising and management expenses generally fluctuates consistently with the related reimbursable property operating expenses to which it relates 
expense reimbursements increased million  or  in the period versus the period 
expense reimbursements  expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses  were in both the and periods 
other income increased  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in interest income from proceeds from debt and equity offerings  which were temporarily invested in short term investments until the acquisition of coroc was completed as well as increases in vending income 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreases in management and leasing fees from a center that we no longer managed in property operating expenses increased by million  or  in the period as compared to the period 
property operating expenses increased due to portfolio wide increases in advertising and common area maintenance projects 
real estate taxes  which are also a part of property operating expenses  increased due to the coroc portfolio property values being revalued in several jurisdictions at the purchase price value 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in the period as compared to the period 
the increase is primarily due to compensation expense related to employee share options granted in the second quarter of and restricted shares granted in and all of which are accounted for under fas as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses remained constant at in both the and periods 
depreciation and amortization decreased from million in the period to million in the period 
this was due principally to the accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain assets in the acquisition of the coroc properties in december accounted for under fas for tenants that terminated their leases during the period 
interest expense increased million  or  during the period as compared to the period due primarily to the million prepayment premium and the write off of deferred loan costs totaling  incurred in the fourth quarter of relating to the early extinguishment of the million john hancock life insurance company mortgages 
the increase in interest expense caused by this charge was partially offset by lower borrowings throughout the year prior to the acquisition of our interest in coroc in november and the related million senior unsecured note issuance 
in november  we purchased our consolidated joint venture partner s interest in coroc 
therefore  consolidated joint venture minority interest decreased million due to less than a full year of allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner during the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner was based on a preferred return on investment as opposed to their ownership percentage and accordingly had a significant impact on our earnings 
in accordance with fas  our pigeon forge  tennessee property was classified as an asset held for sale as of december  and therefore its results of operations  net of minority interest  amounting to  for the year were reclassified into discontinued operations 
the period includes the results of the pigeon forge center as well as a loss on sale of the dalton  georgia property in the period of approximately million 
this loss was partially offset by the gain on sale of the clover and ll bean  new hampshire properties of approximately million in the period 
during the first quarter of  we sold our outlet center at our seymour  indiana property 
due to significant continuing involvement the sale did not qualify as discontinued operations under the provisions of fas we recorded a loss on sale of real estate of million  net of minority interest of  as a result of the sale 
net proceeds received for the center were approximately million 
compared to base rentals increased million  or  in the period when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the december acquisition of the coroc portfolio of nine outlet center properties 
in addition  the overall portfolio occupancy at december  increased from to compared to december  also  base rent is impacted by the amortization of above or below market rate lease values recorded as part of the required purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of the coroc portfolio 
the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
for the period  we recorded million of rental income for net amortization of market leases compared to  for the period of days that we owned the coroc portfolio 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related above below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively 
percentage rentals  which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels the breakpoint  increased million or 
reported same space sales per square foot for the twelve months ended december  were per square foot  a increase over the prior year ended december  same space sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period

the increase in this percentage is due to higher reimbursement rates at the coroc portfolio 
other income increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of outparcels of land of million in also  there were increases in vending and other miscellaneous income and an increase in fees from managed properties 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in the period as compared to the period 
the increase is the result of the additional operating costs of the coroc portfolio in the period 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in the period as compared to the period

however  as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in the period to in the period 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in the period to million in the period 
in the acquisition of the coroc portfolio in december  accounted for under sfas business combinations  or fas  significant amounts were allocated to deferred lease costs and other intangible assets which are amortized over shorter lives than building costs 
interest expense increased million  or  during the period as compared to the period due primarily to the assumption of million of cross collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of related to the acquisition of the coroc portfolio 
the increase was offset by the retirement of million of senior unsecured notes  which matured in october at an interest rate of  with proceeds from our property and land parcel sales and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures increased  in the period compared to the period due to the expansions during the summers of and at twmb associates  llc  or twmb  outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina of approximately  and  square feet respectively 
the total square footage of the center is now approximately  square feet 
in december  we and blackstone originally acquired the coroc portfolio through the formation of the joint venture coroc which was consolidated under the provisions of finr 
therefore  consolidated joint venture minority interest increased million due a full year of allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner in the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner is based on a preferred return on investment as opposed to their ownership percentage and accordingly has a significant impact on our earnings 
earnings allocated to the minority interest in the operating partnership decreased million in direct correlation to the changes in the earnings from the operating partnership as described in the preceding paragraphs 
discontinued operations resulted in a loss of approximately  due mainly to the loss on sale of the dalton  georgia property in the period of approximately million 
this loss was partially offset by the gain on sale of the clover and ll bean  new hampshire properties of approximately million in the period and the operating income from the pigeon forge  tennessee property included in discontinued operations 
also  included in the period is the sale of the martinsburg  west virginia center and the casa grande  arizona center which resulted in a net gain of approximately  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to is due to a prepayment penalty of million associated with the early extinguishment of the john hancock life insurance company mortgages in october offset by the changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities from to is primarily due to the incremental income from the coroc acquisition in december net cash provided by used in investing activities amounted to  and million during  and  respectively  and reflects the acquisitions  expansions and dispositions of real estate during each year

current developments and dispositions any developments or expansions that we  or a joint venture that we are involved in  have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in an increase in net income or funds from operations

we currently expect the center to be approximately  square feet upon total build out with the initial phase scheduled to open in late wholly owned dispositions in february  we completed the sale of the outlet center on a portion of our property located in seymour  indiana and recognized a loss of million  net of minority interest of  net proceeds received from the sale of the center were approximately million 
we continue to have a significant involvement in this location by retaining several outparcels and significant excess land adjacent to the disposed property 
as such  the results of operations from the property continue to be recorded as a component of income from continuing operations and the loss on sale of real estate is reflected outside the discontinued operations caption under the guidance of regulation s x in june and september  we completed the sale of two non core properties located in north conway  new hampshire and in dalton  georgia  respectively 
net proceeds received from the sales of these properties were approximately million 
we recorded a gain on sale of the north conway  new hampshire properties of approximately million during the second quarter of and recorded a loss on the sale of the dalton  georgia property of approximately million during the third quarter of  resulting in a net loss for the year ended december  of million which is included in discontinued operations

accordingly  a debt premium of million was recorded and is being amortized over the life of the debt 
we funded the majority of our share of the equity required for the transaction through the issuance of million common shares on december   generating approximately million in net proceeds 
the results of the charter oak portfolio have been included in the consolidated financial statements since december  in november  we purchased for million including acquisition costs the remaining two thirds interest from our joint venture partner 
we recorded a debt discount of  with an effective interest rate of to reflect the fair value of the debt deemed to have been acquired in the acquisition 
the all cash transaction was funded with a combination of common shares  preferred shares and unsecured senior notes 
the transaction completes the charter oak acquisition which solidifies our position in the outlet industry 
in addition  the centers acquired provide an excellent geographic fit  a diversified tenant portfolio and are in line with our strategy of creating an increased presence in high end resort locations 
unconsolidated joint ventures twmb associates  llc in september  we established twmb  a joint venture in which we have a ownership interest  to construct and operate the tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina 
we and our joint venture partner each contributed million in cash for a total initial equity in twmb of million 
in june the first phase opened with approximately  square feet 
since we have opened two additional phases with the final one opening in the summer of total additional equity contributions for the second and third phases aggregated million by each partner 
the myrtle beach center now consists of approximately  square feet and has over name brand tenants 
the center cost approximately million to construct 
during march  twmb  entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america with a notional amount of million for five years 
under this agreement  twmb receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes the rate of interest on million of variable rate mortgage debt to a fixed rate of for the contract period 
in april  twmb obtained non recourse  permanent financing to replace the construction loan debt that was utilized to build the outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the new mortgage amount is million with a rate of libor 
the note is for a term of five years with payments of interest only 
in april  twmb has the option to extend the maturity date of the loan two more years until all debt incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property 
either partner in twmb has the right to initiate the sale or purchase of the other party s interest at certain times 
if such action is initiated  one member would determine the fair market value purchase price of the venture and the other would determine whether they would take the role of seller or purchaser 
the members roles in this transaction would be determined by the tossing of a coin  commonly known as a russian roulette provision 
if either partner enacts this provision and depending on our role in the transaction as either seller or purchaser  we could potentially incur a cash outflow for the purchase of our partner s interest 
however  we do not expect this event to occur in the near future based on the positive results and expectations of developing and operating an outlet center in the myrtle beach  south carolina area 
tanger wisconsin dells  llc in march  we established wisconsin dells  a joint venture in which we have a ownership interest  to construct and operate a tanger outlet center in wisconsin dells  wisconsin

deer park enterprise  llc in october  deer park enterprise  llc  which we refer to as deer park  a joint venture in which we have a one third ownership interest  entered into a sale leaseback transaction for the location on which it ultimately will develop a shopping center that will contain both outlet and big box retail tenants in deer park  new york 
in conjunction with the real estate purchase  deer park closed on a loan with bank of america in the amount of million due in october and a purchase money mortgage note with the seller in the amount of million 
in october  bank of america extended the maturity of the loan until october the loan with bank of america incurs interest at a floating interest rate equal to libor plus and is collateralized by the property as well as joint and several guarantees by all three venture partners 
the purchase money mortgage note bears no interest 
however  interest has been imputed for financial statement purposes at a rate which approximates fair value 
the agreement consisted of the sale of the property to deer park for million which was being leased back to the seller under an operating lease agreement 
at the end of the lease in may  the tenant vacated the property 
however  the tenant did not satisfy all of the conditions necessary to terminate the lease and deer park is currently in litigation to recover from the tenant its on going monthly lease payments and will continue to do so until recovered 
annual rents due from the tenant are million

during  we made additional equity contributions totaling million to deer park 
both of the other venture partners made equity contributions equal to ours during the periods described above

moody s investors services had previously announced in june their upgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to an investment grade rating of baa in november  we closed on million of senior unsecured notes  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
these ten year notes were issued by the operating partnership and were priced at of par value 
the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the coroc acquisition described above 
during  we retired million  senior unsecured notes which matured on october  with proceeds from our property and land parcel sales and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
we also obtained the release of two properties which had been securing million in mortgage loans with wells fargo bank  thus creating an unsecured note with wells fargo bank for the same face amount 
as part of the coroc acquisition  we assumed million of cross collateralized debt which has a stated  fixed interest rate of and matures in july we initially recorded the debt at its fair value of million with an effective interest rate of 
accordingly  a debt premium of million was recorded and is being amortized over the life of the debt 
when the remainder of the portfolio was acquired in november  we recorded a debt discount of  with an effective interest rate of 
the net premium had a recorded value of and million as of december  and  respectively 
during  we obtained an additional million unsecured line of credit from wells fargo bank  bringing the total committed unsecured lines of credit to million 
in addition  we completed the extension of the maturity dates on all four of our unsecured lines of credit with bank of america  wachovia corporation  citigroup and wells fargo bank until june of amounts available under these facilities at december  totaled million 
interest is payable based on alternative interest rate bases at our option 
certain of our properties  which had a net book value of approximately million at december   serve as collateral for the fixed rate mortgages 
we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of december  in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total debt operating leases preferred share dividends interest payments these amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements 
all of our variable rate agreements are based on the day libor rate 
for calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt  the rate at december  was used 
preferred share dividends reflect cumulative dividends on our class c preferred shares on which we pay an annual dividend of per share on  outstanding shares as of december  the class c preferred shares are redeemable at the option of the company for per share after the respective optional redemption date 
the future obligations include future dividends on preferred shares units through the optional redemption date and the redemption amount is included on the optional redemption date 
our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios  including debt service coverage and leverage  and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or on a cumulative basis 
we have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants  however  should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default  the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt 
we currently maintain four unsecured  revolving credit facilities with major national banking institutions  totaling million 
as of december   amounts outstanding under these credit facilities totaled million 
as of february   all four credit facilities will expire in june we operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  or the code 
a reit which distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately million in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately million to common shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions 
if events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced  we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our reit status 
the following table details our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands commercial commitments construction commitments unconsolidated joint venture debt guarantees construction commitments presented in the table represent new developments  renovations and expansions that we have committed to the completion of construction

our pro rata portion of the twmb mortgage secured by the center is million 
there is no guarantee provided for the twmb mortgage by us 
related party transactions as noted above in unconsolidated joint ventures  we are owners of the twmb and wisconsin dells joint ventures 
twmb and wisconsin dells pay us management  leasing and development fees  which we believe approximates current market rates  for services provided to the joint venture 
during  and  we recognized approximately   and  in management fees    and  in leasing fees and   and  in development fees  respectively 
tflp is a related party which holds a limited partnership interest in and is the minority owner of the operating partnership

the only material related party transaction with tflp is the payment of quarterly distributions of earnings which were  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
under the provisions of fin r  we were considered the primary beneficiary of our joint venture  coroc 
therefore  the results of operations and financial position of coroc were included in our consolidated financial statements prior to november when we acquired the remaining two thirds interest in the joint venture 
in  the fasb issued fin r which clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r were effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities in and thereafter 
we have evaluated deer park  wisconsin dells and twmb note and have determined that under the current facts and circumstances we are not required to consolidate these entities under the provisions of fin r 
acquisition of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations  or fas  we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land  building  tenant improvements  debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles  such as the value of leases with above or below market rents  origination costs associated with the in place leases  and the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  if any 
we depreciate the amount allocated to building  deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from three to years 
the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term  which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs will be written off 
the tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
if we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property  deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets  our computation of depreciation expense may be significantly understated or overstated 
cost capitalization in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
 we capitalize all incremental  direct fees and costs incurred to initiate operating leases  including certain general and overhead costs  as deferred charges 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing these leases 
we amortize these costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term 
we capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties  including certain general and overhead costs and interest costs 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets 
direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable 
if we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such an event  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount  and if less  recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
if we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts  our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets 
we believe that no impairment existed at december  revenue recognition base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants sales volume percentage rentals and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion  common area maintenance  insurance and real estate tax expenses 
percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met 
expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue over the remaining lease term  as adjusted to reflect the early termination date 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  or fas r 
fas r is a revision of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  fas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
we adopted fas r effective january  using a modified prospective application 
fas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date and which are ultimately expected to vest will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated under fas  which we adopted on january  we will incur additional expense during related to new awards granted during that cannot yet be quantified 
we are in the process of determining how the guidance regarding valuing share based compensation as prescribed in fas r will be applied to valuing share based awards granted after the effective date and the impact that the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which we refer to as fin fin refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and through the normal operation of the asset 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on issue no 
determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
this consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership 
the consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners  if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights 
whether the presumption of control is overcome is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances  for which the consensus provides additional guidance 
this consensus is currently applicable to us for new or modified partnerships  and will otherwise be applicable to existing partnerships in this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities  such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership 
we believe this consensus will have no impact on the accounting treatment currently applied to our joint ventures 
funds from operations funds from operations  which we refer to as ffo  represents income before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is intended to exclude generally accepted accounting principles  which we refer to as gaap  historical cost depreciation of real estate  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  any of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc  of which we are a member  has encouraged its member companies to report their ffo as a supplemental  industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
in addition a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our ffo performance 
ffo has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are ffo does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ffo does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ffo does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  ffo does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters which may not be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate ffo differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ffo should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ffo only supplementally 
see the statements of cash flow included in our consolidated financial statements

economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
during  we have approximately  square feet  or  of our portfolio coming up for renewal 
if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we renewed of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at a increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate 
we also re tenanted  square feet during at a increase in the average base rental rate 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
the existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in as of february  in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
as of both december  and  occupancy at our wholly owned centers was 
consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers  we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified 
while we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term  it may reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term 
sales at our outlet centers along the gulf of mexico were adversely affected by the hurricanes during and fortunately  the structural damage caused by the hurricanes was minimal and our property insurance will cover the vast majority of the repair work that is being completed as well as lost revenues during the days the centers were closed 
we do not expect this to have a material impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and to hedge anticipated future financings 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in september  we entered into two forward starting interest rate lock protection agreements to hedge risks related to anticipated future financings in and the agreement locked the us treasury index rate at on a notional amount of million for years from such date in december this lock was unwound in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the issuance of the million senior unsecured notes due in discussed in note and  as a result  we received a cash payment of million 
the gain was recorded in other comprehensive income and is being amortized into earnings using the effective interest method over a year period that coincides with the interest payments associated with the senior unsecured notes due in the agreement locked the us treasury index rate at on a notional amount of million for years from such date in july in november  we entered into an additional agreement which locked the us treasury index rate at on a notional amount of million for years from such date in july we anticipate unsecured debt transactions of at least the notional amount to occur in the designated periods 
the fair value of the interest rate protection agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
at december   we would have paid approximately  if we terminated the agreements 
a decrease in the us treasury rate index would increase the amount we would pay if the agreements were terminated by million 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity 
we do not intend to terminate the agreements prior to their maturity because we plan on entering into the debt transactions as indicated 
during march  twmb  entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million for five years to hedge floating rate debt on the permanent financing that was obtained in april under this agreement  twmb receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes the rate of interest on million of variable rate mortgage debt to a fixed rate debt of for the contract period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
at december   twmb would have received approximately  if the agreement was terminated 
a decrease in the day libor index would decrease the amount received by twmb by million 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity 
twmb does not intend to terminate the interest rate swap agreement prior to its maturity 
the fair value of this derivative is currently recorded as a liability in twmb s balance sheet  however  if held to maturity  the value of the swap will be zero at that time 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to market risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million and its recorded value was million 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity
