table of contents sole trustee and owned of the operating trust at december  archstone smith common shares trade on the new york stock exchange nyse asn 
our principal focus is to maximize shareholder value by acquiring  developing  redeveloping and operating apartments in our core markets  which are characterized by protected locations with limited land for new housing construction  expensive single family home prices  and a strong  diversified economic base with significant employment growth potential  generating long term sustainable growth in operating cash flow  increasing our common share dividend  as we have done for the last consecutive years  recruiting  training and retaining people whom we believe are the best and brightest in the apartment business  building the dominant operating platform in the apartment industry  to produce an operating franchise that we believe is more efficient  more profitable and difficult to replicate 
we do this by investing in technology to improve our operations and customer service delivery  strengthen our brand position and solidify our reputation for operational leadership  and managing our invested capital through the selective sale of apartment communities in non core locations and redeploying the proceeds to fund investments with higher anticipated growth prospects in outstanding locations in our core markets 
accomplishments archstone smith produced same store revenue growth of for the full year of the fourth quarter of was the seventh consecutive quarter of improving top line revenue growth

in and through the first quarter of  we significantly enhanced our presence in manhattan through the acquisition of three high rise apartment communities  totaling million and  units 
we also started construction on the mosaic  a unit joint venture community and our first development in manhattan 
at year end  our committed total expected investment in the new york city metropolitan area  including joint venture developments  totaled billion 
in december  we completed our first acquisition in europe with the purchase of an building  unit portfolio concentrated in mannheim  germany  for million 
we believe acquiring and operating these assets will help us research and understand this new market and help establish relationships with key market participants

we increased our annualized common share dividend level to  or per quarter 
this marks our th consecutive annual common share dividend increase and a total increase of since our first quarter common share dividend was paid in february  representing our nd consecutive quarterly payment 
investment strategy capital recycling program 
we believe that one of our most important responsibilities is to improve the quality of our portfolio with every transaction we complete 
in  we completed the disposition of billion of non core assets  excluding ameriton  representing  units  generating gaap gains of million and an average unleveraged internal rate of return irr of 
the cash gains on the sale of these assets was million  or of our cost basis 
in addition  during we acquired billion of assets  excluding ameriton and german acquisitions  representing  units  and started development of million of assets  representing  units  in markets that include manhattan  los angeles and downtown san francisco 
focus on core markets 
we focus our investment activities in our core markets  which are characterized by i protected locations with limited land for new housing construction  ii expensive single family home prices  and iii a strong  diversified economic base with significant employment growth potential 
barriers to entry exist in areas where there is a very limited amount of land zoned and available for housing development  and where local municipalities are reluctant to zone additional land for new housing 
we believe that the limited competition  expensive single family housing and diverse economic base typical of our core markets maximizes our ability to keep our occupancy relatively constant and produce sustainable long term cash flow growth 
our investment professionals generally live in our core markets  allowing them to thoroughly research and evaluate potential investments at the street corner level of detail 
this locally based investment acumen guides our decisions in making investments  allowing us to continually upgrade the quality of our portfolio 
as a result  our portfolio is concentrated in many of the most desirable neighborhoods in the washington  dc metropolitan area  southern california  the san francisco bay area  the new york city metropolitan area  boston  chicago  southeast florida and seattle 
as of year end  approximately of our portfolio was concentrated in our core markets 
our goal is to sell virtually all of our remaining non core assets by the end of acquisition of the oakwood portfolio 
in  we completed the acquisition of a community portfolio from oakwood worldwide  for billion 
this strategic transaction further strengthens archstone smith s dominant ownership presence in highly desirable neighborhoods in many of our most attractive submarkets marina del rey  toluca hills  san jose and la jolla  california  the rosslyn ballston corridor in the washington  dc metropolitan area and downtown boston 
we expect to acquire two additional communities from oakwood during the first half of developments 
we place considerable emphasis on the value created through our development of new apartment properties 
at december   we had billion in total expected investment of assets in our development pipeline  including communities under construction and in planning in the reit  ameriton and through joint ventures 
we completed million of new reit development properties during the year  
table of contents representing  units  in markets that include the washington  dc metropolitan area  boston and southern california 
during the year  four reit development properties achieved stabilization  representing a total expected investment of million and adding a total of  units to archstone smith s operating portfolio 
we believe that our locally based development infrastructure creates a significant competitive advantage for identifying and completing very attractive investment opportunities in our core markets 
as such  we expect our development capability to continue to be a key contributor to growth and to create significant value as properties are completed and stabilized at attractive yields during the next several years 
additionally  we generally utilize guaranteed maximum price contracts gmax through qualified third party contractors to reduce our development risk from a cost perspective 
ameriton 
ameriton  our wholly owned subsidiary  continues to be a highly profitable franchise for our company 
utilizing our development  acquisition and operating expertise  ameriton identifies under managed operating communities  as well as development and redevelopment opportunities with a short term ownership horizon of one to three years that have the potential to produce significant profits 
ameriton sold communities in including two joint venture transactions  contributing million or per share to archstone smith s earnings  million  or per share  to its ffo  and producing an average unleveraged pre tax internal rate of return irr of 
ameriton s gains in were principally driven by the sale of newly developed communities in markets that include suburban washington  dc and houston 
as of december   ameriton has communities representing  units under construction or in planning  including joint ventures 
while nearly of ameriton s development pipeline is located in our core markets  they are in locations that we deem to be non core for ownership by the reit 
a significant component of ameriton s successful development program is attributable to its creation of a successful business as a relationship based financier of new  high quality apartment communities that are built by other capable developers with whom we have fostered relationships over the past several years 
since  ameriton has completed seven of these transactions  realizing pre tax gains of million  or per share  and funds from operations ffo of million  or per share  at an average leveraged irr of 
leveraging our relationships with third party apartment developers  we also created a related business that offers a compelling platform for long term value creation mezzanine debt financing 
our ameriton investment team sources these transactions on behalf of the reit  as the interest income is qualifying reit income and therefore not subject to tax 
of the million in mezzanine loan commitments we have made through december   million were originated in during the year  we had two loans repaid in the amount of million 
we are encouraged by the opportunities to selectively invest capital at very attractive returns in this incremental area of our business 
customer focused operations we believe that our long term cash flow growth is enhanced by the archstone and charles e 
smith brands  our goal to build the dominant operating platform in the apartment industry  robust and scalable technology  and continued investment in our associates 
powerful brands 
an essential component of our strategy is to consistently offer a higher level of service at our apartment communities 
through our seal of service tm  we offer our residents convenience and flexibility all backed by written guarantees 
we believe we are the only public apartment reit with an established track record of offering customers flexible lease terms from two to months as standard practice and the only apartment company in the nation to offer fully transactional online leasing through online lease  our proprietary automated online leasing system 
our expansion in the new york city metropolitan area underscores the embedded value of our customer focused operating and branding strategy 
we believe we are the only apartment owner and manager in manhattan to provide all of the following services i leasing offices that are open seven days a week  ii we will show 
table of contents apartments without an appointment or a broker  iii we can process applications in hours  compared to one week process time at most competitors  iv we offer innovative services and unconditional service guarantees through our seal of service tm  and v we provide a technology platform that makes it easy for people to do business with us through online rent payment  online service requests and our online lease 
customers have demonstrated an overwhelming acceptance of this approach  allowing us to achieve a increase in new move in rents in our same store operating communities in manhattan in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in investing in technology 
web based property management system 
we invest in technology to improve our core operations and make it easier for our customers to do business with us 
in  we completed the roll out of mri  our web based property management system that provides the platform for virtually all of our customer facing technology products 
in addition  mri s automated work order solution allows us to manage and execute service requests more efficiently  in line with our day service guarantee  through which we promise to respond to service requests within hours 
equally important  mri gives us the ability to accurately track resident histories to better understand and serve our customers 
revenue management 
in  we pioneered the use of a sophisticated revenue management product  lease rent options lro 
lro brings a tremendous amount of discipline to the pricing process  enabling us to more precisely forecast demand to optimize pricing and occupancy across our portfolio  thereby increasing revenues 
in  we continued to refine and improve lro to better manage pricing  occupancy and lease expirations to make us less vulnerable to seasonal shifts in customer traffic 
we believe that pricing in the apartment industry is too reliant on on site individuals who often use gut instinct to make what are ultimately arbitrary pricing decisions 
to bring discipline and sophistication to pricing in the apartment industry  we began to actively market lro to other apartment owners  making sales to two large apartment companies  several other apartment owners are currently pilot testing the software 
resident web sites 
mri provides a seamless online presence with our customers via resident only web sites  which we rolled out nationally in  allowing customers access to us to pay rent online  submit and track service requests  participate in periodic feedback surveys  review and update account information and more 
in  we collected approximately  online rent payments  representing revenue of million and of total rent collected 
online rent payments continued to accelerate throughout the year  with online rent payments in december totaling of all rent collected 
online lease 
we believe that we are the only national apartment company to be able to complete leases fully online through online lease  our proprietary automated online leasing system 
using online lease  customers can log on to any computer to search for a specific apartment  view real time pricing and availability  select rentable amenities such as garages or additional storage  complete their credit application and finalize their lease all online 
fully launched in june of  online lease has been well accepted by our customers  representing approximately of all leases transacted in the fourth quarter 
of those apartments that were leased online for the full year of  were leased sight unseen by customers and were leased by customers who only visited an archstone smith community once 
we believe online lease provides us with a meaningful competitive edge to better serve customers and improve our operating margins 
internet marketing and lead management 
approximately of all of our leases for the year ended december   were sourced through the internet  with the vast majority of our customers beginning their apartment search online through third party search vehicles such as google and yahoo or internet listing services ils that include apartments 
com and rentnet 
com as well as our branded web sites  archstoneapartments 
com and smithapartments 
com 
because the acquisition cost for customers sourced through the internet is dramatically lower than traditional marketing channels such as print advertising we estimate the cost per lead is approximately for those sourced through the internet compared with an average of approximately for traditional 
table of contents print advertising we continue to focus our marketing efforts on improving our online presence and lead management system 
in  we established an internet lead management ilm system in mri  partnering with six ilss with whom we have national contracts to provide customer lead information  which is automatically incorporated into mri 
activated nationally in the third quarter of  the ilm allows our site teams to be far more attentive and responsive to online customers  which we believe is critical to converting more customer leads into leases 
driving renewals and referrals 
we believe that we can create a distinct competitive advantage by identifying and implementing the best practices for our most critical processes and standardizing them at each of our communities to deliver a consistently superior resident experience that drives loyalty 
we believe that loyalty is a key indicator of a resident s likelihood to renew his or her lease or refer our apartment communities to friends and co workers as a place to live 
to gain an understanding of our customers loyalty and the drivers that would increase their potential to renew and refer we engaged satmetrix  a leading customer experience management company  to conduct and analyze random periodic online feedback surveys among existing residents as well as online surveys to new residents two weeks after move in 
the principal objective of these surveys is to determine what actions are needed to improve renewals and referrals 
the satmetrix system also provides immediate feedback to correct specific resident issues before they impact brand satisfaction  compares our communities to identify best practices  and provides the mechanism by which to recognize excellent managers and provide development to those who need it 
in addition  our core process project cpp team  established in  focuses on three important customer touch points that we believe are critical to customer acquisition  renewal and referral i customer inquiries and leasing  ii the move in experience  and iii renewal  transfer or move out 
to capture best practices  the cpp team conducts extensive field research with front line associates to translate proven tactics into scalable tools that ensure consistency in our day to day customer interactions 
in  the cpp team completed the roll out of the move in tracker  a tool that allows community teams to track all the customer critical steps needed for a smooth move in 
as a result of the move in tracker  we have received extremely favorable feedback from our customers via satmetrix surveys about their move in experiences 
we believe that a smooth move in increases the likelihood of a positive first impression of our company and our brands  helping to drive customer renewals and referrals 
other current projects led by the cpp team include improvements to our make ready process and renewal program 
investing in our associates 
a critical component to ensuring the integrity of our brand offering is attracting  training and retaining the best professionals in our industry and giving them the support and tools to provide an exceptional customer experience 
associate engagement 
in  we contracted with kenexa  a leading associate engagement consultancy  to measure our associates engagement and identify key drivers of engagement 
it is our belief that associates who are fully engaged in their roles tend to contribute at a much higher level to the company and stay with us longer 
our initial results were extremely encouraging  with of our associates taking part in the survey 
our results place us in the top quartile of responses among the companies with whom kenexa works  including many of the best in class corporations in the united states  such as home depot  kraft foods  molson coors  rei  starwood  fedex kinko s and blockbuster 
incentive based compensation 
we made significant progress during the year on our incentive based compensation ibc program  through which leasing associates take on a more traditional sales role  earning the majority of their compensation through leases sold 
previously  approximately of our leasing associates income was based on leasing activity  with the ibc program  of a leasing associate s income is generated through leases they put in place 
we believe that providing this performance based income potential allows us to attract higher caliber sales associates who are more vested in delivering a superior experience to our customers 
currently  the ibc program is in place at of our larger communities with full roll out expected in 
table of contents developing our leaders 
in  another corporate and community managers attended the practice of leadership  our feedback based training program for corporate managers  and leading teams at archstone smith  a comparable three day program for our on site teams 
these three day programs focus on six leadership practices consistent with our company culture and values that we believe drive our success 
this program is complemented by a feedback component  through which direct reports and peers evaluate corporate managers to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement to enhance their effectiveness as team leaders 
to date  a total of managers have participated in the program 
conservative balance sheet management one of our primary financial objectives is to structure our balance sheet to enhance our financial flexibility in order to have access to capital when others in the industry do not 
archstone smith has a significant equity base  with equity market capitalization of billion  including the value of the a common units  as of december  our investment grade debt ratings from standard poor s bbb  moody s investors service baal and fitch  inc bbb are indicative of our solid financial position 
in september  we sold approximately million common shares under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the million of gross proceeds was initially used to pay down our credit facilities  which had a total outstanding balance of million when the transaction was announced 
this equity offering  together with the incremental debt capacity it gave the company  provides the financial flexibility to fund approximately billion needed to complete our billion development pipeline 
in  we increased our unencumbered asset base to billion as of the end of the year 
as of march   we had approximately million of liquidity  including cash on hand  restricted cash in escrows and capacity on unsecured credit facilities 
we believe this financial flexibility allows us to act more quickly on new investment opportunities as they arise 
we also repurchased million of our common shares in  at prices ranging from to per share and at an average price of per share 
we have structured our long term debt maturities in a manner designed to avoid unmanageable repayment obligations in any year

consistent dividend growth

item a 
risk factors the following factors could affect our future financial performance we have restrictions on the sale of certain properties 
a taxable sale of any of the properties acquired in the smith merger prior to january   could result in increased costs to us in light of the tax related obligations made to the former smith partnership unitholders 
under the shareholders agreement between archstone smith  the operating trust  robert h 
smith and robert p 
kogod  we are restricted from transferring specified high rise properties located in the crystal city area of arlington  virginia until october   without the consent of messrs 
smith and kogod  which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and at increased costs to us 
however  we are permitted to transfer these properties in connection with a non taxable sale or a sale of all of the properties in a single transaction or pursuant to a bona fide mortgage of any or all of such properties in order to secure a loan or other financing 

table of contents we have similar restrictions with respect to the properties acquired from oakwood worldwide in the restrictions last until the earlier of a such time as of the contributing partners have sold  redeemed or otherwise disposed of their a common units in a taxable event and b the later to occur of x years from the closing of the contribution of such properties and y the last to die of howard ruby and ed broida 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers  senior officers and company managers 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
debt financing could adversely affect our performance 
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing and preferred equity 
these risks include the risks that we will not have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected rates  that we will be unable to refinance current or future indebtedness  that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  and that we will be unable to make necessary investments in new business initiatives due to lack of available funds 
increases in interest rates could increase interest expense  which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of obligations 
if we are unable to make required payments on indebtedness that is secured by a mortgage on our property  the asset may be transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and value to us 
additionally  our debt agreements contain customary covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and  in certain instances  restrict our ability to engage in material asset sales  mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
these debt agreements also require us to maintain various financial ratios 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in a requirement to repay the indebtedness prior to its maturity  which could have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
some of our debt instruments bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these instruments and would increase the cost of refinancing these instruments and issuing new debt 
as a result  higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 
we had billion in total debt outstanding as of december   of which billion was secured by real estate assets and billion was subject to variable interest rates  including million outstanding on our short term credit facilities 
we may not have access to equity capital 
a prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public equity markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new investment activities 
these alternative sources of financing may be more costly than raising funds in the public equity markets 
we could be subject to acts of terrorism 
periodically  we receive alerts from government agencies that apartment communities could be the target of both domestic and foreign terrorism 
although we currently have insurance coverage for losses incurred in connection with terrorist related activities  losses could exceed our coverage limits and have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
we are subject to risks inherent in ownership of real estate 
real estate cash flows and values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local  regional or national conditions such as an oversupply of communities or a reduction in rental demand in a specific area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available properties and the ability to provide adequate property maintenance and insurance and to control operating costs 
real estate cash flows and values are also affected by such factors as government regulations  including zoning  
table of contents usage and tax laws  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  property tax rates  utility expenses  potential liability under environmental and other laws and changes in environmental and other laws 
although we seek to minimize these risks through our market research and property management capabilities  they cannot be totally eliminated 
we are subject to risks inherent in real estate development 
we have developed or commenced development on a substantial number of apartment communities and expect to develop additional apartment communities in the future 
real estate development involves risks in addition to those involved in the ownership and operation of established communities  including the risks that financing  if needed  may not be available on favorable terms  construction may not be completed on schedule  contractors may default  estimates of the costs of developing apartment communities may prove to be inaccurate  the costs and availability of materials may be adversely affected by global supply and demand  and communities may not be leased or rented on profitable terms or in the time frame anticipated 
timely construction may be affected by local weather conditions  local moratoria on construction  local or national strikes and local or national shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment 
these risks may cause the development project to fail to perform as expected 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may not be able to recover our investments 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid  which may tend to limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other market conditions 
our ability to dispose of assets in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions 
furthermore  our mezzanine loans to real estate investors may not be recoverable if those investors are unable to monetize the underlying asset at underwritten amounts 
compliance with laws and regulatory requirements may be costly 
we must comply with certain accessibility  environmental  building  and health and safety laws and regulations related to the ownership  operation  development and acquisition of apartments 
under those laws and regulations  we may be liable for  among other things  the costs of bringing our properties into compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements 
non compliance with certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability without regard to fault  and could give rise to actions brought against us by governmental entities and or third parties who claim to be or have been damaged as a consequence of an apartment not being in compliance with the subject laws and regulations 
as part of our due diligence procedures in connection with the acquisition of a property  whether it is an apartment community or land to be developed  we conduct an investigation of the property s compliance with known laws and regulatory requirements with which we must comply once we acquire a property  which investigation includes performing a phase i environmental assessment of the property and a phase ii assessment if recommended in the phase i report 
we cannot  however give any assurance that our investigations and these assessments have revealed all potential non compliance issues or related liabilities 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold continues as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there have been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
we have implemented guidelines and procedures to address moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues if and when they arise 
we believe that these measures will minimize the potential for any adverse effect on our residents 
the terms of our property and general liability policies after june   may exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future material impact on our financial results 

table of contents changes in laws may result in increased cost 
we may not be able to pass on increased costs resulting from increases in real estate taxes  income taxes or other governmental requirements  such as the enactment of regulations relating to internal air quality  directly to our residents 
substantial increases in rents  as a result of those increased costs  may affect the ability of a resident to pay rent  causing increased vacancy 
archstone smith s failure to qualify as a reit would have adverse consequences 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code and we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
we cannot give any assurance that new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to archstone smith s qualification 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the internal revenue service granted us relief  we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
in the event that we failed to qualify as a reit  we would be required to pay significant income taxes and would have less money available for operations and distributions to shareholders 
this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  our declaration of trust limits the ownership of our shares by any person or group of related persons to  unless special approval is granted by our board 
the operating trust intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that the operating trust will qualify 
the operating trust intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  the operating trust will be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it is deemed to be a publicly traded partnership  unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the tax code 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as real property rents  dividends and interest 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
we believe that the operating trust will meet this qualifying income test  but cannot guarantee that it will 
if the operating trust were to be taxed as a corporation  it will incur substantial tax liabilities  archstone smith would fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes and archstone smith s and the operating trust s ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 
we are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance 
there are certain types of losses such as from war that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
additionally  many of our communities in california are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake fault lines and many of our southeast florida assets are in coastal locations and subject to hurricanes 
although we maintain insurance to cover most reasonably likely risks  including earthquakes and hurricanes  if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  we could lose both our invested capital in  and anticipated profits from  one or more communities 
we may also be required to continue to repay mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to such communities 
the terms of our property and general liability policies after june   may exclude certain mold related claims 
we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future material impact on our financial results 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
any such loss could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a concentration of investments in certain markets 
as shown in the geographic distribution table below in item properties  our most significant investment concentrations are in the washington  dc metropolitan area  southern california and the san francisco bay area 
southern california is the geographic area comprising the los angeles county  san diego  orange county  
table of contents the inland empire  and ventura county markets 
we are  therefore  subject to increased exposure positive or negative from economic and other competitive factors specific to markets within these geographic areas 
our business is subject to extensive competition 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies and other owners of real estate that we compete with in seeking land for development  apartment communities for acquisition and disposition and residents for apartment communities 
all of our apartment communities are located in developed areas that include other apartment communities 
the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease units and on the rents charged 
in addition  single family homes and other residential properties provide housing alternatives to residents and potential residents of our apartment communities

item legal proceedings during the second quarter of  we entered into a full and final settlement in the united states district court for the district of maryland with three national disability organizations and agreed to make capital improvements in a number of our communities in order to make them fully compliant with the fair housing act and americans with disabilities act 
the litigation  settled by this agreement  alleged lack of full compliance with certain design and construction requirements under the two federal statutes at of the company s communities 
as part of the settlement  the three disability organizations all recognized that archstone smith had no intention to build any of its communities in a manner inconsistent with the fha or ada 
the amount of the capital expenditures required to remediate the remaining communities named in the settlement is estimated at million and was accrued as an addition to real estate during the fourth quarter of the settlement agreement approved by the court allows us to remediate each of the designated communities over a three year period  and also provides that we are not restricted from selling any of our communities during the remediation period 
we agreed to pay damages totaling million  which included legal fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs 
we accrued other expenses of million during  which included the settlement and all related legal and other expenses paid in or expected to be paid during we are subject to various claims filed in and in connection with moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at certain high rise properties we once owned in southeast florida

although certain of these claims continue to be in various stages of litigation  with respect to the majority of these claims  we have either settled the claims and or we have been dismissed from the lawsuits that had been filed 
with respect to the lawsuits that have not been resolved  we continue to defend these claims in the normal course of litigation

in analyzing the performance of our operating portfolio  we evaluate same store communities separately from non same store communities and other properties

same store same store revenue expense same store noi growth growth growth garden high rise total same store revenues were up in all core markets for both the garden and the high rise portfolios  resulting primarily from higher rental income per unit and a slight improvement in the percentage of units occupied 
we experienced revenue growth throughout as our markets strengthened and pricing power returned as new move in rents  a leading indicator  continued to rise 
in addition to improving operating fundamentals across our markets  we believe lro  our revenue management system  has also enabled us to better manage lease expirations and produce higher revenues in the slow seasonal months 
the washington dc metropolitan area and southern california  our two largest markets  reported revenue growth of and  respectively 
the drivers of our year over year operating expenses were higher real estate taxes and personnel costs  as well as extraordinary snow removal and utility expenses in the first quarter of these increases were realized to a greater degree in high rise 
these revenue and expense increases resulted in overall portfolio same store noi growth of  which was the major driver of the margin increase recorded for the overall portfolio

these increases were offset primarily by revenue declines due to continuing weakness in the san francisco bay area  chicago and atlanta  which decreased  and  respectively 
the primary drivers of our year over year operating expenses were higher site and regional personnel costs and real estate taxes  which were partially offset by lower ground lease expenses in high rise 
these revenue and expense increases resulted in an overall portfolio same store noi decline of 
non same store analysis the million noi decrease in the non same store portfolio is primarily attributable to million related to community dispositions offset by million related to community acquisitions and million related to newly developed apartment communities  including lease ups 
ameriton the million noi decrease from ameriton apartment communities is primarily attributable to a million increase from community acquisitions and million related to newly developed apartment communities  including lease ups  partially offset by a million decrease attributable to community dispositions 
other income the increase in other income during as compared to resulted primarily from i a million increase from insurance recoveries related to moisture infiltration and mold litigation settlement costs associated with a previously owned community in southeast florida  ii a million increase in interest income on mezzanine loans to third parties and other interest bearing instruments  iii a million increase in hurricane related insurance reimbursements  and iv a million insurance reimbursement for costs incurred in connection with our fha and ada settlement 
these increases and other smaller insurance related reimbursements recorded in were partially offset by a million benefit related to the sale of ces and higher land gains in there was no significant change in the amount of other income during as compared to notable differences in the composition of other income were the collection and recognition of million related to the settlement of a ces lawsuit during  a million decrease in the collection of indemnified ces accounts receivable over days during as compared to  a million increase in gains related to the disposition of land during as compared to  and million of dividend income on stock investments in depreciation expense the depreciation increases in each year are primarily related to the increase in the size of the real estate portfolio 
a few of the major drivers are i amortization of the value associated with in place leases over the lease term on new acquisitions  ii disposition of assets with a lower depreciable basis at significant gains  and reinvestment of the proceeds into assets with a higher depreciable basis  partially offset by iii cessation of depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale 
interest expense the increase in gross interest expense during as compared to is due to higher average debt levels associated with the increased size of the real estate portfolio combined with higher average interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities and other variable rate debt instruments 
the oakwood transaction was the most significant driver of the portfolio increase in capitalized interest also increased significantly as a result of the increase in the size and number of communities under construction and  to a lesser extent  higher average interest rates in the slight decrease in interest expense during as compared to is primarily the result of a reduction in weighted average debt interest rates and a decrease in the average outstanding mortgage balance during as compared to  as we paid off secured debt during the year 
this was partially offset by an increase in the average outstanding long term debt balance in as compared to capitalized interest decreased in as 
table of contents compared to due to fewer communities under construction  which partially offset the overall decrease in gross interest expense 
general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses during as compared to is due to higher employee compensation related costs  increased recruiting and relocation expenses and higher travel costs 
these costs were partially offset by a smaller charge in as compared to pertaining to executive common share grants related to the achievement of total shareholder return performance targets 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during as compared to is due primarily to executive common share grants related to the achievement of total shareholder return performance targets associated with a three year special incentive plan  an increase in audit and consulting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and the impact of the fourth quarter special dividend on deus earned on restricted share units and some employee share options 
these expenses were partially offset by lower severance costs and payroll expense in as compared to other expenses the increase in other expenses during as compared to is primarily attributable to i million increase in early debt extinguishment costs  ii million in legal expenses and litigation settlement costs related to the settlement of the fha and ada lawsuit and other legal matters  iii a million increase in hurricane related charges  iv a million writeoff of a loan to a prior affiliate  and v a million impairment related to a non core asset 
the decrease in other expense during as compared to is primarily due to a million expense associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold recorded during at certain high rise properties we previously owned in southeast florida 
the moisture infiltration costs pertain to estimated and incurred legal fees and estimated settlement costs  additional residential property repair and replacement costs  and temporary resident relocation expenses 
minority interest minority interest increased in each successive period as a result of higher earnings and changes in the relative number of common units in each period  which averaged  and of net earnings for  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in was primarily attributable to the oakwood transaction  which was partially funded with common units  whereas the percentage decrease in was primarily attributable to conversions of common units to common shares 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities the increase in income from unconsolidated entities during as compared to is due primarily to an increase in disposition related gains  including million from ameriton joint ventures and recognition of a million incentive payment earned in connection with the final liquidation of a joint venture partnership in these increases were partially offset by recognition of million of contingent proceeds from the expiration during the second quarter of of certain indemnifications related to the sale of ces 
income from unconsolidated entities increased during as compared to primarily due to gains from the sale of joint venture operating communities and the recognition of contingent proceeds from the expiration of certain indemnifications related to the sale of ces 
other non operating income other non operating income during consists primarily of million of gains from the sale of our rent 
com investment and million from the sale of other equity securities 

table of contents other non operating income increased during as compared to due to the recognition of million in gains from the sale and settlement of equity securities  and a million gain from the sale of our property management business in gains on real estate dispositions see discontinued operations analysis below for discussion of gains 
discontinued operations analysis included in the overall results discussed above are the following amounts associated with properties which have been sold or were classified as held for sale as of december  dollars in thousands

as a result of the execution of our strategy of managing our invested capital through the selective sale of apartment communities in non core locations and redeploying the proceeds to fund investments with higher anticipated growth prospects in our core markets  we had significant disposition activity in all three years 
the resulting gains  net of disposition costs  were the biggest driver of overall earnings from discontinued operations 
the gains progressively increased in each successive year as communities with higher values were sold and the market for apartment communities improved 
our taxable reit subsidiary gains also increased in each year primarily as a result of ameriton community dispositions  which contributed significantly to our earnings in each year 
the year to year changes in revenues and operating expenses associated with discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the market and number of communities sold during the period or held for sale at the end of the period 
changes in direct operating expenses and allocated interest expense generally relate to the overall revenue levels for each period 
income taxes fluctuate in relation to the taxable gains associated with communities sold by our taxable reit subsidiaries  which increased in each successive year 
the portion of earnings from discontinued operations allocated to minority interest increased each year due primarily to the higher income resulting from higher gains 

table of contents preferred share dividend analysis preferred share distributions decreased by million in as compared to and by million in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the conversion of series h preferred shares into common shares in may  the conversion of series a preferred shares into common shares in december  the redemption of our series d preferred shares in august  the conversion of series k preferred shares into common shares in september and the early conversion of series l preferred shares into common shares in december these savings were partially offset by the recognition of million of issuance costs related to the series d preferred shares in the decrease in preferred share distributions due to conversions was offset by an increase in common share dividends 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities as they become available 
as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations  current cash positions  the available capacity under our unsecured credit facilities  gains from the disposition of real estate and our demonstrated ability to access the capital markets  we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during analysis of historical cash flows the following discussion of our historical cash flows is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows found in item of this annual report 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased million in as compared to resulting primarily from an increase in noi 
this increase in cash flow from community operations in addition to proceeds from insurance reimbursements were largely offset by cash used to pay down accrued expenses and accounts payable and used to fund other operating needs  including increased interest  general and administrative expenses and other costs 
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased million in as compared to this increase was principally due to lower moisture infiltration and resulting mold related expenses during  lower interest expense due to a reduction in the average debt rates and a reduction in average debt balances during  as well as higher investment income from marketable equity securities 
see results of operations for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance in each year 
investing and financing activities the billion net decrease in cash flows from investing activities in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in community acquisitions  including the oakwood transaction  and a decrease in proceeds from community dispositions 
in addition  proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities decreased and we increased our funding of mezzanine loans to third parties during net cash flows provided by investing activities increased by million in as compared to this was due primarily to an increase in net proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets during as compared to the same period of  and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in that were acquired in  which is included in other  net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
the increase was partially offset by higher spending on acquisitions and development activity during as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities increased billion in as compared to  due primarily to issuance of additional long term debt and common shares and additional borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities to finance real estate investments

planned investments following is a summary of planned investments as of december   including ameriton but excluding joint ventures dollar amounts in thousands 
the amounts labeled discretionary represent future investments that we plan to make  although there is not a contractual commitment to do so 
the amounts labeled committed represent the approximate amount that we are contractually committed to fund for communities under construction in accordance with construction contracts with general contractors 
planned investments units discretionary committed communities under redevelopment communities under construction communities in planning and owned communities in planning and under control community acquisitions under contract fha ada settlement capital accrual total in addition to the planned investments noted above  we expect to make additional investments relating to planned expenditures on recently acquired communities as well as recurring expenditures to improve and maintain our established operating communities 
we anticipate completion of most of the communities that are currently under construction and the planned operating community improvements by the end of no assurances can be given that communities we do not currently own will be acquired or that planned developments will actually occur 
in addition  actual costs incurred could be greater or less than our current estimates 
funding sources we anticipate financing our planned investment and operating needs primarily with cash flow from operating activities  disposition proceeds from our capital recycling program  existing cash balances and borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities  prior to arranging additional long term financing 
we had million in available 
table of contents capacity on our unsecured credit facilities  million of cash in tax deferred exchange escrow and million of cash on hand at march  in addition  we expect to complete the disposition of billion of reit operating communities during as of march   the operating trust had million available in shelf registered debt securities which can be issued subject to our ability to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing market conditions 
we anticipate filing registration statements for both archstone smith and the operating trust to facilitate our future ability to issue additional securities 
litigation and contingencies during the second quarter of  we entered into a full and final settlement in the united states district court for the district of maryland with three national disability organizations and agreed to make capital improvements in a number of our communities in order to make them fully compliant with the fair housing act and americans with disabilities act 
the litigation  settled by this agreement  alleged lack of full compliance with certain design and construction requirements under the two federal statutes at of the company s communities 
as part of the settlement  the three disability organizations all recognized that archstone smith had no intention to build any of its communities in a manner inconsistent with the fha or ada 
the amount of the capital expenditures required to remediate the remaining communities named in the settlement is estimated at million and was accrued as an addition to real estate during the fourth quarter of the settlement agreement approved by the court allows us to remediate each of the designated communities over a three year period  and also provides that we are not restricted from selling any of our communities during the remediation period 
we agreed to pay damages totaling million  which included legal fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs 
we accrued other expenses of million during  which included the settlement and all related legal and other expenses paid in or expected to be paid during during and  we incurred losses associated with multiple hurricanes in florida 
as a result of this damage  we recorded charges for actual or estimated losses associated with both wholly owned and unconsolidated apartment communities and benefits for collected or estimated insurance recoveries 
these estimates represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and related recoveries and are based on the most current information available from our insurance adjustors 
we are subject to various claims filed in and in connection with moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at certain high rise properties we once owned in southeast florida 
these claims generally allege that water infiltration and resulting mold contamination resulted in the claimants having personal injuries and or property damage 
although certain of these claims continue to be in various stages of litigation  with respect to the majority of these claims  we have either settled the claims and or we have been dismissed from the lawsuits that had been filed 
with respect to the lawsuits that have not been resolved  we continue to defend these claims in the normal course of litigation 
we are a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that the results of any such claims or litigation  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has discussed the development and selection of all of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to these policies 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas internal cost capitalization we have an investment organization that is responsible for development and redevelopment of apartment communities 
consistent with gaap  all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  
table of contents incurred during development and redevelopment activities are capitalized 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  we believe internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
if future accounting rules limit our ability to capitalize internal costs or if our development activity decreased significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  there could be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if hypothetically  we were to reduce our development and land acquisition activity by with no corresponding decrease in internal costs  our net earnings per common share could decrease by approximately or approximately based on amounts 
valuation of real estate long lived assets to be held and used are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
we also evaluate assets for potential impairment when we deem them to be held for sale 
valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amounts of our real estate 
furthermore  decisions regarding when a property should be classified as held for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires significant management judgment 
there are many phases to the disposition process ranging from the initial market research to being under contract with non refundable earnest money 
deciding when management is committed to selling an asset is therefore highly subjective 
when determining if there is an indication of impairment  we estimate the asset s noi over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted cash flow basis and compare this amount to its carrying value 
estimating the expected noi and holding period requires significant management judgment 
if it is determined that there is an indication of impairment for assets to be held and used  or if an asset is deemed to be held for sale  we then determine the fair value of the asset 
the apartment industry uses capitalization rates as the primary measure of fair value 
specifically  annual noi for a community is divided by an estimated capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the community 
determining the appropriate capitalization rate requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket  as well as the quality and location of the properties 
further  capitalization rates can fluctuate up or down due to a variety of factors in the overall economy or within local markets 
if the actual capitalization rate for a community is significantly different from our estimated rate  the impairment evaluation for an individual asset could be materially affected 
for example  we would value a community with annual noi of million at million using a capitalization rate  whereas that same community would be valued at million if the actual capitalization rate were 
historically we have had limited and infrequent impairment charges  and the majority of our apartment community sales have produced gains 
for example  we have sold approximately billion of real estate assets over the years covered by this annual report  which produced approximately billion in gains 
over that same period  we have recorded million in valuation related impairments 
capital expenditures and depreciable lives we incur costs relating to redevelopment initiatives  revenue enhancing and expense reducing capital expenditures  and recurring capital expenditures that are capitalized as part of our real estate 
these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives determined by management 
we allocate the cost of newly acquired properties between net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
the primary intangible asset associated with an apartment community acquisition is the value of the existing lease agreements 
when allocating 
table of contents cost to an acquired property  we first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land  building and fixtures assuming the property is vacant 
we estimate the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease up 
we depreciate the building and fixtures based on the expected useful life of the asset and amortize the intangible value of the lease agreements over the average remaining life of the existing leases 
determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization  the assignment of depreciable lives and determining the appropriate amounts to allocate between tangible and intangible assets for property acquisitions requires our management to exercise significant judgment and is therefore considered a significant accounting estimate 
total capital expenditures were and of weighted average gross real estate as of december  and  respectively 
additionally  depreciation expense as a percentage of depreciable real estate was  and or  and per share for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if the actual weighted average useful life were determined to be one year shorter or longer than management s current estimate  our annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease approximately or per common share 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional detail on depreciable lives 
pursuit costs we incur costs relating to the potential acquisition of real estate which we refer to as pursuit costs 
to the extent that these costs are identifiable with a specific property and would be capitalized if the property were already acquired  the costs are accumulated by project and capitalized in the other asset section of the balance sheet 
if these conditions are not met  the costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs include but are not limited to earnest money  option fees  environmental reports  traffic reports  surveys  photos  blueprints  direct and incremental personnel costs and legal costs 
upon acquisition  the costs are included in the basis of the acquired property 
when it becomes probable that a prospective acquisition will not be acquired  the accumulated costs for the property are charged to other expense on the statement of earnings in the period such a determination is made 
because of the inherent judgment involved in evaluating whether a prospective property will ultimately be acquired  we believe capitalizable pursuit costs are a critical accounting estimate 
if it were determined that of accumulated costs relating to prospective acquisitions were deemed improbable as of december   net earnings for the year ended december  would decrease by approximately per share  excluding refundable earnest money 
consolidation vs 
equity method of accounting for ventures from time to time  we make co investments in real estate ventures with third parties and are required to determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for the venture 
fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised and emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights are the two primary sources of accounting guidance in this area 
appropriate application of these relatively complex rules requires substantial management judgment  which we believe makes the choice of the appropriate accounting method for these ventures a critical accounting estimate 
for example  if we were to consolidate all of our equity method joint ventures at december   our total assets and total liabilities would increase by approximately billion and billion  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements our real estate investments in entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities  variable interest entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and entities we do not control through majority economic interest  are not consolidated and are reported as investments in unconsolidated entities

in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf no 

this issue provides a framework for evaluating whether a general partner or group of general partners or managing members controls a limited partnership or limited liability company and therefore should consolidate the entity 
the presumption that the general partner or group of general partners or managing members controls a limited liability partnership or limited liability company may be overcome if the limited partners

fin 
fin resulted in fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  to be applied to more situations than many entities had previously applied it in practice 
fin requires entities to recognize liabilities for conditional asset retirement obligations if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
based on the premise that no tangible asset lasts forever  the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  a company should recognize an asset retirement liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation with the offset to the asset itself in the period in which the obligation is incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the impact of fin is most discernable to the company related to asbestos exposure at certain of our real estate assets 
fin became effective no later than the end of the fiscal years ending after december  and was adopted by the company for the year ended december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows

this statement is effective as of the first fiscal year beginning after december  we do not believe any voluntary changes in accounting principles  relating to the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk stock investments from time to time we make public and private investments in equity securities 
the publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the private investments  for which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for at cost 
declines in the value of public and private investments that our management determines are other than temporary  are recorded as a provision for possible loss on investments 
our evaluation of the carrying value of these investments is primarily based upon a regular review of market valuations if available  each company s operating performance and assumptions underlying cash flow forecasts 
in addition  our management considers events and circumstances that may signal the impairment of an investment 
interest rate hedging activities we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and will occasionally utilize interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as hedges with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
these derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
we do not use these derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes 
further  as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained  nor do we expect to sustain  a material loss from the use of these hedging instruments 
we formally assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
we measure hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative instrument with the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
we assess effectiveness of purchased interest rate caps based on overall changes in the fair value of the caps 
if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 

table of contents to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market value conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
these methods and assumptions include standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost and termination cost 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and therefore  are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition 
during the years ended december   and we recorded an increase decrease to interest expense of   and  for hedge ineffectiveness caused by a difference between the interest rate index on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt and the underlying index of the associated interest rate swap 
we pursue hedging strategies that we expect will result in the lowest overall borrowing costs and least degree of earnings volatility possible under the new accounting standards 
the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rates  as of december  dollar amounts in thousands 
the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate or market risks

at inception  these swap transactions had an aggregate notional amount of million and a fair value of zero 
the long term unsecured debt these swap transactions related to was issued in august the hedge was terminated when the debt was issued 
the fair value of the cash flow hedge upon termination was a liability of approximately million 
this amount was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as additional interest expense as the hedged forecasted interest payments occur 
foreign currency hedging activities we are exposed to foreign exchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments 
during  we entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million and designated the contract as a cash flow hedge 
the fair value of this forward contract at december  was 
energy contract hedging activities we are exposed to price risk associated with the volatility of fuel oil and electricity rates 
during  we entered into contracts with several of our suppliers to fix our payments on set quantities of fuel oil and electricity 
if the contract meets the criteria of a derivative  we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of the overall changes in floating rate payments made on our energy purchases 
as of december   we had energy related derivatives with aggregate notional amounts of million and an estimated fair value and carrying amount of 
these contracts mature on or before december  
table of contents equity securities hedging activities we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of certain equity securities 
during  we entered into forward sale agreements with an aggregate notional amount  which represents the fair value of the underlying marketable securities  of approximately million and an aggregate fair value of the forward sale agreements of approximately  to protect against a reduction in the fair value of these securities 
we designated this forward sale as a fair value hedge 
during  we settled all of the forward sales agreements for approximately million shares  and sold  shares of marketable securities  which were not subject to forward sales agreements  resulting in an aggregate gain of approximately million 
the total net proceeds from the sale were million  with the marketable securities basis determined using the average costs of the securities 
the fair value of forward sales agreements at december  was interest rate sensitive liabilities the table below provides information about our liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date
