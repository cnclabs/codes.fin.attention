item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview angelica is a leading provider of outsourced linen management services to the healthcare industry in the united states 
we offer comprehensive linen management services to the us healthcare industry  including hospitals  long term care facilities  surgery centers  medical clinics  dental offices  and other medical providers 
among the items that we clean and provide  on either a rental or customer owned basis  are bed linens  towels  gowns  scrubs  surgical linens and surgical packs  as well as mops  mats and other dust control products 
to a more limited extent  we also provide linen management services to customers in the hospitality business 
currently  we operate laundry service centers and serve customers in states 
we were founded in and subsequently expanded into three operating divisions uniform manufacturing  uniform retail  and linen management services 
in fiscal  we sold our uniform manufacturing business 
in fiscal  we sold our uniform retail business and decided to focus our remaining linen management services business on the healthcare industry 
in fiscal  healthcare linen services represented approximately of our revenues  with of revenues from other linen service markets 
we expect healthcare linen management services to increase as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
except as otherwise noted  the following discussion relates only to our continuing linen management operations and excludes our previously discontinued operations 
although our fiscal year has not changed  we changed the terminology describing our fiscal year in february we now  and retroactively  refer to the fiscal year by the calendar year in which the first months of the fiscal year fall 
fiscal year started on january  and ended on january   fiscal year started on february  and ended on january   and fiscal year started on january  and ended on january  our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in january and usually contains weeks  but occasionally contains weeks 
fiscal and contained weeks with a week fourth quarter 
fiscal had weeks  with its fourth quarter being comprised of weeks 
revenues are recognized when the clean linens are delivered to the customer 
our textile service revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or over the four year period 
while a portion of our growth has been achieved organically by developing existing customers and adding new customers  we began adding to this growth with acquisitions in fiscal going forward  we expect to accelerate our annual organic growth rate to through the customer focused programs described herein  and to supplement this growth with additional acquisitions consistent with board approved debt guidelines 
our acquisition program is focused on healthcare laundry services currently owned either by hospitals or competitors 
since we seek to concentrate our service centers in clusters enabling us to better service our customers and providing us with economies of scale  we primarily look for opportunities within or around our existing markets 
although we may expand geographically via acquisition  this will most likely be on the fringes of existing service areas 
for example  since beginning this strategy we have completed eleven acquisitions  nine of which have been in existing markets with the remaining two being adjacent to existing markets 
we expect these acquisitions to significantly add to our existing revenues and earnings 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we consider strategic value  projected ebitda  impact on earnings per share  return on net assets and internal rate of return 
the eleven acquisitions completed since november are shown in the chart belo w 
in aggregate  we paid million for these eleven acquisitions  with five of these acquisitions costing million or more 
all acquisitions were financed from available credit facilities and cash flow from operations 
the following chart depicts the acquisitions we have completed since november date acquired company seller description of acquisition goodwill other intangibles recorded august bob white services  inc bob white purchased healthcare linen service contracts and selected assets in northern ohio and upstate new york m march royal institutional services  inc and its affiliate  the surgi pack corporation royal purchased the stock of the companies and accompanying healthcare linen services business in somerville and worcester  ma m january national service industries and national linen uniform service purchased laundry facilities and linen services business in dallas and wichita falls  tx m january tartan textile services purchased healthcare linen services business and assumed lease for laundry facility in hempstead  ny m december united linen services d b a golden states services purchased healthcare linen services business and assumed leases for laundry facilities in sacramento and turlock  ca m may tartan textile services purchased healthcare linen services contracts from tartan s portland  me laundry facility m april duke university health system purchased laundry in durham  nc and signed a long term supply agreement with duke healthcare facilities m april on premise laundries purchased inventory and equipment and assumed healthcare linen services contracts at two on premise laundries located at hospitals in tx and ga m december national service industries purchased laundry facility and healthcare linen services business in safety harbor  fl m november tenney laundry services purchased healthcare linen service contracts and selected assets in batavia  ny m final purchase price exceeded million 
during fiscal  we recorded million in goodwill acquired in transactions completed during fiscal versus million in fiscal this amount may increase over time as a result of any subsequent acquisition we make as part of our acquisition strategy 
annual goodwill impairment testing is performed at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year using a fair value based analysis 
cost of textile services are recognized and recorded as incurred 
over the last five years  our cost of textile services as a percent of revenues have gone from in fiscal to in fiscal during this period  however  cost of textile services have ranged from a low of in fiscal to a high of of revenues in fiscal  primarily due to the volatility of energy costs 
the major components of our cost of textile services are direct and indirect production labor and fringe benefit costs  which represented of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  linen depreciation  which represented of revenues in fiscal  versus of revenues in fiscal  delivery expenses  which represented of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal this includes delivery fuel expense which was of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal  and utilities  which represented of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal this includes natural gas which was of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal we initiated an operations process improvement project that is expected to lower the cost of textile services through more efficient operations and best practices implementation 
also  over the next three years  we plan to reduce the cost of textile services by improving linen and natural gas procurement  implementing new delivery planning and routing technology  and making capital investment in our facilities to increase labor productivity and reduce energy utilization 
during fiscal we hired an outside consulting firm to review delivery route efficiencies at one of our service centers and made changes based upon their recommendations 
we have seen substantial savings from these changes and in fiscal will begin implementing a global positioning system and route optimization program in the remaining service centers 
in addition  we have instituted a standardization process for purchasing linens and changed our energy hedging policy to an o perational model from an economic model allowing us to take advantage of longer term buying opportunities for natural gas in the future 
in the third quarter of fiscal we entered into three futures contracts to reduce our exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
these contracts  combined with existing fixed price contracts for the physical delivery of natural gas  effectively fix the cost for approximately of our total natural gas requirements for the next two years  and and for the third and fourth years  respectively 
we will continue to seek attractive natural gas purchasing opportunities with a goal of locking in natural gas prices and quantities for periods that roughly match up with customer contract expirations 
finally  we are planning to invest approximately million per year during the next three years for capital improvements  the vast majority of which will be invested in our service centers in order to improve productivity and decrease energy usage 
gross profit is the difference between revenues and cost of textile services  and gross margin is the relationship of gross profit expressed as a percent of revenues 
over the past five years  our gross profit has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during this period  gross margin has ranged from to of revenues 
our goal of reaching a gross margin by fiscal will be impacted by a number of factors  including our ability to obtain price increases equal to the inflationary pressures we experience 
while the majority of our customer contracts have inflation pricing escalator clauses based on various consumer price indexes  or cpi  the aggregate annual price increases are usually capped and the costs listed above affect us to a greater degree than the cpi as they comprise a much larger part of our cost structure 
in addition  mounting pressure on our healthcare customers to contain costs has somewhat curtailed our abi lity to negotiate price increases in line with inflation 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future energy availability or costs  but we believe our energy hedging policy will allow us to lessen our energy cost volatility and take advantage of pricing opportunities in the energy market in the future 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include all other operating expenses not included in cost of textile services  including those related to sales and marketing  human resources  accounting  information systems  and other administrative functions not allocable to individual customers 
with the sale of our manufacturing business in fiscal and retail business in fiscal  we have streamlined our corporate offices from people at the end of fiscal to people at the end of fiscal in fiscal  sg a was million  representing of revenues compared with million  or of revenues in fiscal of the fiscal sg a  million was attributable to our service centers and million was attributable to our atlanta and st 
louis corporate offices 
we expect sg a to continue to decline as a percent of revenues as we continue to grow our business organically and through acquisition and the fixed components of these costs are spread over a larger revenue base 
our information systems upgrade which will continue through could increase sg a in absolute dollars  but during this period should not have any substantial impact on sg a as a percent of revenues 
other operating income includes any non rec urring gains or losses and may vary significantly year to year due to acquisitions and divestitures of assets 
in fiscal  the sale of certain non healthcare accounts in our san diego  stockton and long beach  california service centers generated million of income 
going forward  we may opportunistically dispose of non healthcare assets which no longer fit in our strategic plans 
interest expense is recognized as incurred and includes amortization of any loan fees over the life of the loan 
in fiscal  interest expense was million as a result of higher rates and the additional borrowings we have made to finance our acquisition strategy 
going forward  we target a x debt to ebitda ratio  although this may vary significantly quarter to quarter 
when we exceed this ratio  we would expect to slow acquisitions and focus effort on building ebitda and reducing debt 
when we are below this level we will look at ways to deploy capital  including acquisitions  to maximize shareholder value 
non operating income is recognized as realized and reflects sales of non operating properties  life insurance proceeds  interest on the million note received by us from the buyer as part of the consideration from the sale of the retail business and other non operating items 
for fiscal  non operating income included a cash distribution received in connection with the demutualization of the parent company of an issuer of life insurance policies owned by the company and death benefits received on company owned life insurance policies 
our tax rate reflects statutory tax rates reduced by federal and state tax credits and non taxable income including the cash value gains on life insurance policies held 
in addition  when there might be an alternative tax interpretation other than the one we used  we recognize this possibility via tax reserves 
in fiscal  following the completion of audits in the united states and canada  we recognized a million reversal of these reserves 
in fiscal we recorded an additional reserve of million related to discontinued operations 
in addition  cash taxes paid may differ significantly from recorded expense due to net operating loss nol carryforwards and changes in deferred tax items 
in fiscal we recorded a federal nol of million primarily attributable to the sale of our retail division 
in fiscal we recorded a federal nol of million primarily from differences in the timing of deductions for book and tax purposes 
in addition  we have various other state tax nols and state and federal tax credits 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million to reflect the anticipated loss of various state nols 
we do not anticipate recording net operating losses regularly in the future 
critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on a continuing basis  including those related to linens in service  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  discontinued operations  bad debts  property and equipment  derivative financial instruments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we discuss below the more significant accounting policies  estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
by the ir nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the consolidated financial statements 
linens in service linens in service represent the unamortized cost of textile and linen products purchased for service to customers 
linens in service are amortized over an expected useful life of sixty weeks 
specific physical identification and inventory of linens in service is impractical in our business due to the fact that the inventory is circulating between our facilities and our customers facilities  however  available industry data supports the reasonableness of a week useful life 
furthermore  our amortization policy has produced historical levels of linens in service that are comparable as a percent of textile service rental revenues 
management believes its amortization policy is appropriate for the valuation of linens in service 
self insurance liabilities we self insure liabilities for non union employee medical coverage and liabilities for casualty insurance claims  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  up to certain levels 
we purchase insurance coverage for large claims over the self insured retention levels 
in fiscal  we sold all casualty claims occurring prior to february  to an insurance company 
we maintain the liability for casualty claims that have occurred since february  and these amounts are set forth on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  self insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
while we believe that the estimated liabilities of million and million recorded for casualty and employee medical claims  respectively  as of january  are adequate  and that appropriate judgment has been applied in determining the estimates  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of the claims 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
balances in the deferred income tax accounts are regularly reviewed for adequacy and recoverability by analyzing the expected income necessary to realize the deferred assets  the anticipated tax rates applicable when the deferred items are expected to be recognized and the ability to utilize carryforward items 
at january   we reported an aggregate of million in federal net operating loss carryforward and various state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we do not provide for deferred tax liabilities related to the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance policies under the assumption that these policies will be held by us until death of the insured 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we believe certain positions could be challenged by tax authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance or a partial adjustment 
significant judgment is required in the evaluation of our reserves 
our reserves are regularly reviewed for adequacy and adjusted based on changing circumstances and the progress of tax audits 
in fiscal we recognized a million adjustment in these reserves which resulted in a reduction in our tax expense 
in fiscal we recorded an increase in the reserve of million related to our discontinued operations 
we believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods presented  and net deferred tax assets will be fully recovered  except for million of valuation allowance 
stock based compensation we currently apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors 
under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  companies are encouraged but not required to adopt a fair value based method to recognize compensation expense of equity instruments awarded to employees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will be required to recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date over the required service or vesting period 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on our net income in future periods will include the remaining amortization of the fair value of existing unamortized stock options in the amount of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
any new grants of stock options will increase the amount of amortization expense by the fair value of the newly granted options on the date of grant and this amount will be amortized over the vest ing period of these new options 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we consider the possible impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of possible impairment include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
to determine the potential impairment of long lived assets  we are required to make estimates of the projected future cash flows associated with the use of the assets  as well as their fair values 
we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets as of january  are fully recoverable 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill recorded as of june  was no longer amortized effective in fiscal instead  goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value based analysis at least annually as of the end of the third quarter 
derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow fluctuations related to changes in both interest rates and the price of natural gas 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  we have elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting for our interest rate swap agreement and for a portion of our natural gas futures contracts  where contract terms match and a perfect hedge is determined to exist 
for these cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are measured quarterly and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the natural gas futures contracts that are not considered a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes  the quarterly change in fair value of the derivatives is reported as non operating income or expense 
we believe the use of hedge a ccounting for our derivative contracts  where matched terms exist  provides the best accounting alternative for determining our quarterly and annual financial results 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold the customer contracts serviced by our columbia  illinois service center  exiting the st 
louis  missouri market and agreeing to a three year non compete 
in january we completed the sale of the remaining real estate and personal property 
the service center s cash flows  results of operations  and certain assets are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
we completed the sale of our retail business segment to healthcare uniform company  inc  an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc  at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the segment s financial position  cash flows and results of operations are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
our continuing operations reflect the results of our remaining textile services healthcare laundry and linen management business 
results of continuing operations fiscal year ended dollars in thousands january  january  january  revenues   cost of services   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expense  amortization of other acquired assets  other operating income  net  income from operations   interest expense   non operating income   income before income taxes  income taxes   income from continuing operations  analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to textile service revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal acquisitions during fiscal contributed million of the revenue increase  offset in part by the loss of million of revenues due to the sale of non healthcare customer accounts 
fiscal benefited from a full year of revenues from acquisitions completed in fiscal  which accounted for another million of the revenue increase in fiscal organic growth in revenues was million  or  due to an average price increase  plus a volume increase 
consistent with our strategic plan to concentrate marketing and acquisition efforts on customers in the healthcare industry  healthcare revenues increased by in fiscal to million 
non healthcare revenues decreased from fiscal  due primarily to the sales of the non healthcare accounts in san diego  long beach and stockton  california in fiscal  and daytona beach  florida in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by non healthcare accounts obtained in our january acquisition of national service industries and national linen uniform service 
as part of our long term strategy  we anticipate a continued decline in non healthcare revenues as a percent of total revenues in future periods 
cost of textile services of million in fiscal increased million or from fiscal after adjusting for the increase in volume  utilities increased million in fiscal  due primarily to higher natural gas costs 
delivery fuel increased by million compared with fiscal  and direct labor expense increased million due to higher wage rates and benefits and increased temporary labor 
competitive pressures in the marketplace limited our ability to offset these cost increases through higher customer pricing 
in addition  annual cpi price increases on many existing contracts were not reflective of our underlying cost increases since the cpi indexes used in those contracts do not weight utilities costs and workers compensation and healthcare insurance expense in the same manner as these items are weighted in our actual cost of services 
due to the aforementioned factors  gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million decreased as a percent of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal bad debt expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared to less than million in fiscal  a result of a significant increase in accounts receivable and specific reserves for certain receivable balances whose collectibility is uncertain 
other factors causing these expenses to not decline further from prior year as a percent of revenues include million of legal expenses associated with a union campaign  initial organizational expenses and the board of directors special committee  million of management transition expense related to our senior management change and fourth quarter reorganization  million expended evaluating alternatives to our debt structure  and mi llion incurred related to the best practices improvement project 
amortization expense increased million in fiscal  reflecting the impact of intangible assets acquired in fiscal and fiscal other operating income of million in fiscal benefited from the net gain of million on the sale of the san diego  stockton  and long beach  california non healthcare accounts 
we reported other operating income in fiscal of million which included the net gain of million on the sale of the daytona beach non healthcare accounts and a gain of million on the settlement of a property insurance claim 
we expect an increase in amortization expense in fiscal due to the full year impact of amortization of significant intangible assets acquired in the royal transaction in march and the bob white transaction in august interest expense in fiscal was million  an increase of million over the million of interest expense incurred in fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects the increase in indebtedness due to the acquisitions closed in fiscal and fiscal and higher interest rates 
at january   we had million in total debt outstanding under a revolving loan agreement with a bank credit facility and million of life insurance policy loans outstanding 
of the amount of debt outstanding on january   million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the libor margin under the credit facility  which was as of january  the remaining debt of million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  as of january   there were million of life insurance policy loans outstanding  which bore interest at a fixed rate of or variable rates ranging from to 
we anticipate that interest expense will increase in fiscal with the full year of interest paid on the debt incurred in connection with the first quarter fiscal royal acquisition as well as the general upward trend in interest rates 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million which includes a million distribution from the liquidation of the parent company of the issuer of life insurance policies we own and million death benefits of company owned life insurance policies  along with interest on invested cash balances and notes receivable  and loss related to our natural gas hedge 
we recorded non operating income of million in fiscal  resulting mainly from gains of million from the sale of real estate we owned in miami  florida from a facility that was closed in fiscal  million from death benefits on company owned life insurance policies  and million received in a bankruptcy settlement of a receivable related to a former business 
for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit of million versus an income tax expense of million in fiscal lower income tax expense in fiscal as compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower pretax income 
income from continuing operations declined million  or  in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from the combination of higher prices for natural gas  delivery fuel and labor that negatively impacted gross profit  increased intangible amortization related to our recent acquisitions  higher interest expense that reflected both acquisition borrowings and higher rates  and lower non operating income 
these items were partially offset by an increase in other operating income resulting from fiscal asset sales and the current year income tax benefit 
analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to textile service revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal acquisitions during fiscal contributed million of the revenue increase  offset in part by the loss of million of revenues due to the sale of non healthcare customer accounts from our daytona beach  florida facility in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  fiscal benefited from a full year of revenues from acquisitions completed in fiscal  which accounted for another million of the revenue increase in fiscal after adjusting fiscal revenues downward by approximately million for the extra week in the fiscal year  organic growth in revenues was million  or  due to an average price increase  plus a volume increase 
consistent with our strategic plan to concentrate marketing and acquisition efforts on customers in the healthcare industry  healthcare revenues increased in fis cal to million 
non healthcare revenues decreased from fiscal  primarily due to the sale of the non healthcare accounts in daytona beach 
cost of textile services of million in fiscal increased million or from fiscal after adjusting for the increase in volume  utilities increased million in fiscal due primarily to higher natural gas costs  and delivery fuel increased by million compared with fiscal direct labor expense increased million due to higher wage rates  and production fringe benefit cost  including workers compensation  increased million year over year 
competitive pressures in the marketplace limited our ability to offset these cost increases through higher customer pricing  as average prices on contract renewals declined slightly year to year 
in addition  annual cpi price increases on many existing contracts were not reflective of our underlying cost increases since the cpi indexes used in those contracts do not weight utility costs and workers compensation and healthcare insurance expense in the same manner as these items are weighted in our actual cost of services 
due to the aforementioned factors  gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million decreased million or in fiscal to of revenues from in fiscal reductions in these expenses included a million decline related to the downsizing of the corporate office and a million decrease due to lower bonus amounts accrued 
these reductions were somewhat offset by million of additional professional fees incurred in connection with our response to a corporate campaign by a union 
bad debt expenses were negligible in fiscal amortization expense increased million in fiscal  reflecting the impact of intangible assets acquired in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal other operating income of million in fiscal benefited from the net gain of million on the sale of the daytona beach non healthcare accounts and a gain of million on the settlement of a property insurance claim 
interest expense in fiscal was million  an increase of million or over the million of interest expense incurred in fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects the increase in indebtedness due to the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal at january   we had million in total debt outstanding under a revolving loan agreement with a bank credit facility 
of the amount of debt outstanding on january   million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the libor margin under the credit facility  which was as of january  the remaining debt of million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million due primarily to gains of million from the sale of real estate we owned in miami  florida from a facility that was closed in fiscal  million from death benefits on company owned life insurance policies  and million received in a bankruptcy settlement of a receivable related to a former business 
we recorded non operating income of million in fiscal  resulting mainly from a million cash payment received in conjunction with the demutualization of a life insurance company that had issued policies owned by us 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of income taxes recorded in fiscal lower income tax expense in fiscal as compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower pretax income and a tax contingency adjustment 
based on the completion of tax audits in the united states and canada  we reevaluated our tax reserves and adjusted our tax liability accordingly 
net income from continuing operations declined million  or  in fiscal lower operating income and an increase of million in interest expense  due to higher debt levels in fiscal  were partially offset by the million increase in non operating income and the lower provision for income taxes for the year 
financial condition as of january   working capital totaled million as compared with million in working capital at the end of fiscal  excluding assets of discontinued operations 
the current ratio ie  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at the end of fiscal and to at fiscal year end 
the decline in our working capital and current ratio is due primarily to the increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as explained below 
receivables and linens in service increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal due to businesses acquired during the year and the increase in operating revenues 
accounts receivable days outstanding of at january  was an increase from days at the end of fiscal the increase reflects increased business in the new york market in which accounts receivable  historically  remain outstanding for a longer period of time than in other markets 
increases in total property and equipment of million and goodwill and other acquired assets of million reflect mainly the acquisition of businesses during fiscal cash surrender value of life insurance at january  is presented net of approximately million of life insurance policy loans outstanding 
other long term assets include the value of the note receivable in the principal amount of million from the sale of our retail business which we carried at a discounted value of million as of january  although we believe the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the issuer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
the increase in accounts payable of million in fiscal is primarily due to higher purchase levels consistent with higher revenues  higher in transit payments yielding increased payables and increased cash  and the timing of invoices received related to utilities  linens  property and equipment  and professional services 
the increase in accrued liabilities of million in fiscal is primarily due to self insurance reserves 
long term debt of million as of january  was million higher than a year ago  reflecting the financing of a portion of the business acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal additional bank borrowings made at the time of the acquisition were subsequently repaid with the proceeds from life insurance policy loans of approximately million 
our ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of january  was  up from as of january  book value per share decreased to at the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased million or in fiscal  due in part to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities discussed in the preceding financial condition section 
partially offsetting this cash flow increase  resulting from the higher current liability balances  are the lower level of income from continuing operations in and the combined increase in receivables and linens in service 
cash flows from investing activities of continuing operations reflect the cash paid of million for businesses and assets acquired in fiscal compared with million in see the acquisition chart included in the preceding overview 
during fiscal  we received proceeds of million from the sale of assets  primarily related to non healthcare customer accounts  compared with million for asset sales in capital expenditures increased million in fiscal from the level in fiscal due to upgrades in information systems and the consolidation of two service centers into nearby facilities in northern california and dallas 
we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal which will be used primarily for replacement  repair and improvement of our facilities and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was million in compared with million in we borrowed funds at similar levels in both years to fund a portion of each year s business acquisitions 
in  our borrowings of million included the net proceeds from bank debt of million and life insurance policy loans of million 
in  all of our long term borrowings of million were made under our bank credit facility 
in addition  financing activities for both years included dividend payments and treasury stock transactions proceeds from stock option exercises that netted to a million use of cash in and a million use of cash in finally  the payment of loan costs related to our bank credit facility increased by approximately million in as we amended the facility in both july and november 
net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in fiscal included the cash proceeds of million from the sale of our columbia  illinois facility which were used to reduce borrowings against our credit facility 
in fiscal  net cash provided by discontinued operations of million included the cash proceeds of million from the sale of our retail business segment 
financing arrangements in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we amended the terms of our credit facility  moving to a secured facility to increase credit availability 
under the terms of these amendments  the credit facility is now secured and the total facility amount of million is structured as a revolving loan 
the loan covenants require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges as defined in the loan documents of no less than to  increasing to to effective october   and a ratio of funded debt to ebitda of no more than to  decreasing to to effective january  we are also required to maintain a consolidated net worth of million plus an aggregate amount equal to of quarterly net income beginning with the fourth quarter fiscal with no reductions for net losses  and an asset coverage ratio of to as of january  we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
as of january   there was million of outstanding debt under the credit facility secured by a first lien on all equipment  inventory and accounts receivable  and certain real estate 
of this amount  million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the libor margin under the credit facility  which was as of january  the remaining debt of million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  furthermore  we had million outstanding in irrevocable letters of credit as of january   which reduced the amount available to borrow under the line of credit to million 
these letters of credit are primarily issued to insurance carriers to secure our ability to pay our self insured workers compensation liabilities 
they automatically renew annually and may be amended from time to time based on collateral requirements of the carriers 
we pay a fee on the out standing letters of credit and unused funds based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda as the terms are defined in the credit facility 
as of january   the fee on the outstanding letters of credit and unused funds was and  respectively 
as of january   we had approximately million of loans outstanding against million cash value of company owned life insurance policies 
these life insurance policies were purchased by us on the lives of a number of officers and directors  both past and present 
we pay the premium and own the policy and carry the policy on our consolidated balance sheet at the cash value of the policy  net of any loans outstanding 
upon the death of any of the covered individuals  we receive the designated death benefit on the policy and may realize a gain to the extent that the death benefit exceeds the cash value 
the proceeds upon surrender of the policy would be reduced by the amount of any loans outstanding  unless repaid by us prior to that time 
redeeming such policies prior to death would trigger an income tax liability  therefore  we choose to borrow against the cash value versus redeeming such policies 
management believes that our financial condition  operating cash flow and available sources of external funds are sufficient to satisfy our requirements for debt service  capital expenditures  dividends and working capital over the course of the next months 
however  if we pursue a large acquisition for which we pay cash as consideration for the assets purchased  we may require alternative funding sources to finance the purchase price 
contractual obligations future payments due under contractual obligations  aggregated by type of obligation  as of the end of fiscal are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest   capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases    purchase obligations linen contracts   natural gas contracts   deferred compensation and pension liabilities  total    discontinued operations exit from st

louis market area  had been unprofitable for several periods and in fiscal suffered the loss of a major customer 
due to the limited potential to improve the profitability of the facility  combined with its relative geographic isolation from our other facilities  the decision was made to exit the st 
louis market  sell its customer contracts and related assets  and pursue a sale of the idle facility 
in the third quarter of  we recorded both a goodwill writeoff of million associated with the business of the columbia facility and an asset impairment charge of million related to the facility s real estate and personal property 
in january  the real estate and personal property were sold for approximately million in cash  resulting in an additional asset impairment charge of under million 
in connection with the sale of the facility s assets  we recorded an after tax loss on disposal of million for the full year of from the beginning of the fiscal year until the sale of the customer contracts in september  the columbia facility reported a net loss from operations of million  as compared to a net loss from operations of million for the full fiscal year and million for the full fiscal year 
the loss from operations in fiscal includes million in employee termination expenses 
the net operating loss for each of the prior periods were reclassified as net loss from discontinued operations  as a result of management s decision to exit the market in the third quarter of fiscal sale of retail segment in february  our board of directors approved a plan to exit and discontinue our retail segment 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of our retail business were segregated  and its results of operations were reported in discontinued operations  effective in the first quarter of fiscal we continued to operate the segment while it was being actively marketed for sale 
we completed the sale of our retail business at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a loss on disposal of the discontinued segment of million net of tax in fiscal as part of the consideration for the sale  we received an unsecured  long term note from the buyer with a face value of million  which we discounted to its then estimated fair value of approximately of face value 
although we believe that the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the issuer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
there were retail stores that were not included in the sale of our retail segment  although the buyer did acquire the working capital related to those stores 
we immediately closed these stores and incurred million of costs in fiscal to terminate the leases 
during fiscal we recognized million in expense related to additional tax impact on the sale of the retail business segment and other discontinued operations 
this amount is included in net loss from disposal of discontinued operations 
from the beginning of the fiscal year until its ultimate sale in july  we operated the retail division as a discontinued operation 
during this partial period  we reported net loss from operations of our retail business of million compared with a net operating loss of million for a full year in the net operating loss for each year has been included in net loss from discontinued operations as a result of the board s decision to exit the retail segment in the first quarter of fiscal net retail sales in the retail segment totaled million in fiscal  representing approximately six months of operations through the date of sale  compared with million for a full year in fiscal the retail segment posted a pretax operating loss of million in fiscal compared to a pretax loss of million in fiscal as discussed in note  the loss includes a pretax charge of million to write down the carrying amounts of long lived assets in certain underperforming stores to their fair values 
we agreed pursuant to the terms of the retail transaction to retain our guaranty on those real estate leases for retail stores that were supported with our guaranty on the date of the closing of the sale 
under the terms of our agreement with the buyer of the retail segment  our guaranty on each of these leases will remain until the end of the current term of the particular lease at which time it must be released 
we do not believe that we will incur any additional losses from these guarantees or any other issue arising from these discontinued operations in future periods

which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees
