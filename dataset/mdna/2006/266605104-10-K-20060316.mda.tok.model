overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based on proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
we are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems that will deliver the right drug to the right place in the right amount at the right time to treat chronic or episodic diseases and conditions 
by integrating chemistry and engineering advancements  we can achieve what drugs or devices alone cannot 
our pharmaceutical systems enable optimized therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration and providing sustained drug delivery 
in addition to developing our own proprietary products  we enter into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize proprietary and enhanced pharmaceutical products based on our technologies 
we have five disclosed on going development programs of which four are in collaboration with third party pharmaceutical companies 
the following are our most advanced pharmaceutical systems in development saber bupivacaine our post operative pain relief depot saber bupivacaine is a sustained release injectable using our saber delivery system to deliver bupivacaine 
saber is a patented controlled drug delivery technology that can be formulated for systemic or local administration of drugs via the parenteral ie  injectable route 
saber bupivacaine is designed to be administered around a surgical site after surgery for post operative pain relief and is intended to provide local analgesia for days or more  which we believe coincides with the time period of the greatest need for post surgical pain control in most patients 
saber bupivacaine is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
transdur sufentanil our transdermal sufentanil patch transdur sufentanil uses our proprietary transdur delivery system to deliver sufentanil  an opioid medication 
transdur sufentanil is designed to provide extended chronic pain relief for up to seven days  as compared to the three days of relief provided with currently available opiate patches 
we anticipate that the small size of our sufentanil patch potentially as small as th the size of currently marketed transdermal fentanyl patches for a therapeutically equivalent dose may offer improved convenience and compliance for patients 
in march  we entered into an agreement with endo pharmaceuticals granting endo exclusive rights to develop  market and commercialize transdur sufentanil in the us and canada 
transdur sufentanil is currently in phase ii clinical trials 

table of contents remoxy in december  we entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics  inc pain therapeutics  amended in december  under which we granted pain therapeutics the exclusive  worldwide right to develop and commercialize selected long acting oral opioid products using our oradur technology incorporating four specified opioid drugs 
the first product being developed under the collaboration is remoxy  a novel long acting oral formulation of the opioid oxycodone targeted to decrease the potential for oxycodone abuse 
remoxy is intended for patients with chronic pain 
remoxy is currently in phase iii trials 
memryte in july  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with voyager pharmaceuticals corporation under which we granted voyager the exclusive  worldwide right to develop and commercialize a development product using the durin implant system to deliver the peptide leuprolide acetate to treat alzheimer s disease based on voyager s patented method of treatment 
memryte  which voyager is developing under this agreement  is currently in phase iii clinical trials 
chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system the chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system is an osmotic implant that is intended to continuously deliver sufentanil for an extended duration 
chronogesic is intended to treat chronic pain  and is based on the duros system  a miniature osmotic pump capable of continuously delivering drugs for up to a year in duration 
we have granted to endo exclusive commercialization rights for chronogesic in the us and canada 
chronogesic completed a pilot phase iii clinical trial 
clinical trials have been suspended pending system redesign 
durect research programs we are also currently researching and developing additional pharmaceutical systems in a variety of therapeutic areas  including chronic pain  central nervous system disorders and cardiovascular diseases based on our proprietary drug delivery platform technologies 
collaborative research and development revenues we generate substantially all collaborative research and development revenues from three collaborative agreements related to the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical systems based on our technologies one with endo pharmaceuticals  inc related to transdur sufentanil  one with pain therapeutics  inc related to remoxy  and one with voyager pharmaceutical corporation related to memryte 
product revenues we currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  and lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products 
this product line was sold through our wholly owned subsidiary api until it was merged with and into us as of december  because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party collaborators to develop pharmaceutical systems based on our drug delivery technologies 

table of contents since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our development products and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the near future as we expect to continue to expand our animal studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in the near future in light of the additional cost to support the infrastructure of our business operations 
we also expect to incur additional non cash expenses relating to amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we do not anticipate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least several years 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities and stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of intellectual property rights is recognized upon assignment of such rights by us to a third party  provided the collectibility is assured and we have no future performance obligations related to such rights  except for the on going de minimus assistance we would provide to the third party with respect to the maintenance of such rights 
upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaborative research and development revenue based on a straight line basis over the period our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the research and development period set forth in the work plan defined in the respective agreements between us and our third party collaborators 
research and development revenue related to services performed under the collaborative arrangements with our corporate collaborators is recognized as the related research and development services are performed 
these research payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research and development agreements generally approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
milestone payments are triggered 
table of contents either by the results of our research and development efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a third party collaborator 
as such  the milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
in addition  upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts  such as under contracts to perform research and development for others  is recognized only to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees thereon 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only after a signed agreement is in place 
for contracts that have a ceiling price or contract value  losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the losses become known and estimable 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technology are amortized over time  while acquired in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
acquired in process research and development represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which have not yet reached technological feasibility  and which have no alternative future use 
the determination of the amount of acquired in process research and development involves several estimates and judgments  including the percentage of completion of the in process technology and assumptions about future cash flows to be derived from the technology and discount rates 
different assumptions employed in determining the value of in process research and development could result in a greater or lesser amount being recorded 
goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
management believes that the discount rate used in this analysis is reasonable in light of currently available information 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 

table of contents we perform a review for impairment of goodwill at least annually in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for clinical trials  engineering  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on managements estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility and employee stock option behaviors 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  changes to the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may materially affect the fair value estimate 
after evaluating our option valuation policies and assumptions in light of current accounting standards related to employee stock options  we expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of our form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
net revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in total revenues in was primarily attributable to higher collaborative research and development revenue recognized from our agreements with third party collaborators  as well as million in revenue from sale of intellectual property rights 
collaborative research and development and other revenue we recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts 
we recorded million of collaborative research and development revenue in compared to million in collaborative research and development revenue represents reimbursement of qualified expenses related to the collaborative agreements with various third parties to research  develop and commercialize potential products using our drug delivery technologies 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in was primarily attributable to increased development activities for transdur sufentanil collaboration with endo  memryte collaboration with voyager and remoxy collaboration with pain therapeutics compared with 
table of contents we received million up front fee in connection with the license agreement signed with endo in march relating to transdur sufentanil 
the million up front fee is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the company s continuing involvement with endo with respect to transdur sufentanil 
the term of the continuing involvement has been estimated based on the current product development plan pursuant to the agreement 
we expect our collaborative research and development revenue to fluctuate in the future years pending our third party collaborators commitment and progress to the research and development programs  although we will continue to increase our efforts to develop products with in connection with various strategic collaborations 
the collaborative research and development revenues associated with our major collaborators are as follows in thousands year ended december  collaborator endo pharmaceuticals  inc pain therapeutics  inc voyager pharmaceutical corporation others total collaborative research and development revenue notes amounts related to up front fees were million and none in and  respectively 
amounts related to up front fees were none and  in and  respectively 
we amortize up front fees on a straight line basis over the period in which we have continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the research and development period set forth in the work plan under each collaboration agreement between us and our third party collaborator 
other revenue from service contracts was  in and  in service contract revenues were related to certain polymer related service contracts we signed with various customers through api  our former subsidiary 
the decrease was primarily due to completion of certain service contracts in we do not expect to increase our effort to generate significant revenue from our service contracts related to polymer business in the future 
other license revenue was  in compared with  in the license revenue in was recognized in connection with our agreement with neurosystec corporation signed in product revenue a portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  and to a lesser extent our biodegradable polymer products 
net product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in product revenue in was primarily due to higher product revenue from our alzet mini pump product line resulting from a greater number of units sold in  partially offset by lower product revenue from our biodegradable polymer products related to the timing of orders from major customers of our polymer products 
in the future  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 

table of contents revenue from sale of intellectual property rights we recorded million of revenue from the sale of intellectual property rights in compared with none in the million of revenue was recognized upon our assignment of certain intellectual property rights to intervet  inc in the third quarter of under the agreement  we assigned to intervet our entire right  title and interest to a us patent  previously jointly owned by the parties 
in connection with this agreement  intervet paid us million in the third quarter of we do not have any continuing obligations under the agreement  except for the on going de minimus assistance we would provide to intervet with respect to the maintenance of such patent 
in the foreseeable future  we do not expect to generate this type of revenue 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were million in compared with million in cost of revenues includes cost of product revenue from our alzet mini pump product line and our biodegradable polymer products and  to a lesser extent  cost of certain polymer related service contracts entered into by api  our former subsidiary  and assumed by us 
cost of product revenues were million in compared with million in the increase in the cost of revenues in was primarily the result of greater number of units sold for our alzet mini pump product line and higher manufacturing cost for our polymer product line compared with the same period in cost of service revenues were  in compared  in due to a decline in our service contract revenue related to our polymer business in as of december  and  we had and manufacturing employees  respectively 
we expect cost of revenues to remain comparable in the future  as we do not expect product revenues to increase significantly in the future 
research and development 
research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with r d personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development expenses were million in compared with million in the increases in research and development expenses in were primarily attributable to the higher employee costs and higher development expenses for saber bupivacaine  remoxy  transdur sufentanil and memryte  partially offset by lower development expenses for chronogesic  compared with in  we incurred higher research and development expenses for saber bupivacaine associated with phase ii clinical trials in australia and uk and ongoing animal toxicological studies compared with we incurred higher development expenses for transdur sufentanil in compared with as we conducted phase ii clinical trials and additional animal studies for this product in we also incurred higher research and development expenses for remoxy and durin leuprolide in to support the development activities related the phase iii clinical trials for these products compared with we incurred lower development expenses for chronogesic in compared with as we continued to work on the system design of the product and focused our development efforts on other pharmaceutical systems in as of december   we had research and development employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect research and development expenses to increase in the near future as we continue product development efforts for our internal programs and those subject to third party collaborations 

table of contents the research and development expenses associated with our major development products approximate the following in thousands year ended december  saber bupivacaine transdur sufentanil remoxy memryte chronogesic others total research and development expenses we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and estimated costs of our research and development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical systems as outlined in the risk factors section of this report 
the duration of development of our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results  the uncertainties with our collaborators commitment and progress to the programs and the uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing 
in addition  with respect to our development programs subject to third party collaborations  the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs 
for additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties  see risk factors above 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with finance  legal  business development  sales and marketing and other administrative personnel  overhead and facility costs  and other general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to higher patent  market research and employee related expenses in compared with as of december   we had selling  general and administrative personnel compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in the near future as we strive to conserve cash and leverage our existing infrastructure to support our current business activities and to comply with corporate governance requirements 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was both million in and we continue to amortize the existing intangible assets at a constant rate over their estimated useful lives 
in and  goodwill was evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas based on our evaluation  no indicators of impairment were noted 
should goodwill become impaired in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value 
the net amount of other intangible assets at december  was  which will be amortized as follows  for the year ending december    in each of the years ending december   and  and  for the year ending december  we periodically evaluate acquired intangible assets for impairment or obsolescence 
should the intangible assets become impaired or obsolete  we will write them down to their estimated fair value 

table of contents stock based compensation 
since inception  we have recorded aggregate deferred compensation charges of million in connection with stock options granted to employees and directors  including  that we recorded at the time of our acquisition of southern biosystems  inc sbs in april for the assumption of outstanding unvested stock options granted to employees and directors of that company 
of the total amount  we have amortized or reversed due to employee terminations approximately million through december  employee stock based compensation expense  net of reversal  was  in and  in of these amounts  employee stock compensation related to the following cost of revenue of none in and  in  research and development expenses of  in and  in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  in and  in total stock compensation expense related to modification of stock option terms was  in and  in total non employee stock compensation was  in and  in of these amounts  non employee stock compensation related to the following research and development expenses of  in and  in and selling  general and administrative expenses of  in and  in expenses for non employee stock options are recorded over the vesting period of the options  with the amount determined by the black scholes option valuation method and remeasured over the vesting term 
the remaining deferred employee stock compensation at december  was none 
termination of employment of option holders could cause stock based compensation in future years to be less than indicated 
other income expense 
interest income and other was million in and million in the increase in interest and other income was primarily the result of higher yields on our cash and investment balances 
the increase in interest and other income in was also due to the receipt of approximately  settlement from our former third party collaborators in we expect interest income to increase slightly in the future compared with as we completed a secondary follow on offering with net proceeds of approximately million in november and achieved higher yields on our current cash and investments 
interest expense was million in and million and the interest expenses were primarily due to the interest accrued on the convertible notes due debt conversion expense was  in compared with none in the debt conversion expense was recorded in connection with the induced conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes in the third quarter of we expect interest expense to remain comparable in the near future as we continue to make interest payments on our convertible notes and to amortize the issuance costs to interest expenses 
income taxes 
income tax provision was  in due to state income taxes paid for api in compared with  in prior to  we had no provision for income taxes  as we incurred losses for all periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purpose of approximately million  which expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 

table of contents as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue

there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders

our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  corporate bonds and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
