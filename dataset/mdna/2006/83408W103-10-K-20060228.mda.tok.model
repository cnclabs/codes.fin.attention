table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe accounting for brand advertising and sponsored search revenues  accounting for wireless revenues and cost of revenues  accounting for e commerce revenues  gross versus net basis of revenue recognition  determination of functional currencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  and assessment of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
advertising revenues include revenue from brand advertising and sponsored search services  after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax 
no revenues from advertising barter transactions were recognized 
brand advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to brand advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements on various website channels and in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media  content integration and email marketing 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectibility is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectibility is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon payment from the customer 
sponsorship contracts may include services similar to those in our brand advertising contracts  are generally for larger dollar amounts and for a longer period of time  may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our websites  may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premier placements 
sponsorship advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided we are meeting our obligations under the contract 
pursuant to sponsored search contracts  which are normally for relatively small dollar amounts and are with small and medium size enterprises  sponsored search services mainly include priority placements in our search directory  listing in our classified advertisements section and pay for click services of displaying the text based links to the websites of our advertisers 
we normally provide the priority placements services and listing in our classified advertisements section for a fixed fee over a period 
revenues from these services are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the contracts 
pay for click services of displaying the text based links to our advertisers websites is charged on a cost per click basis  so that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on the displayed link 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
revenues from the pay for click services are recognized as the users click on the links 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our advertising revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
non advertising revenues include revenues principally from wireless  e commerce and online game services 

table of contents wireless revenues are derived from providing sms  wap  ivr  mms and rbt  mainly consisting of news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tone and logo downloads and various other mobile related products provided to mobile phone users 
wireless service fees are charged on a monthly or per message download basis 
wireless revenues and cost of revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided no significant sohu obligations remain 
we rely on mobile network operators in china to bill mobile phone users for wireless service fees 
in order to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit wholly foreign owned enterprises from providing internet information and value added telecommunication services such as wireless  we rely on beijing sohu  sohu internet and goodfeel to contract with the mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  beijing sohu  sohu internet or goodfeel receives a statement from each of the operators confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering a monthly statement  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  for the month to beijing sohu  sohu internet or goodfeel 
in order to recognize revenue and be paid for services provided  we rely on billing confirmations from the mobile network operators as to the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
we are unable to collect certain wireless services fees from an operator in certain circumstances due to technical issues with the operator s network 
this is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
at the end of each reporting period  where an operator has not provided beijing sohu  sohu internet or goodfeel with the monthly statement for any month confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users for the month  sohu  using information generated from its own internal system and historical data  makes estimates of the failure rate and collectable wireless service fees and accrues revenue accordingly 
the quarterly historical differences in our estimated revenue which was recorded in the financial statements compared to the actual revenue have ranged from an underestimation of  gross margin underestimate of  to an overestimation of  gross margin overestimate of  since when wireless revenues began representing a significant portion of our total revenues 
we believe we have the ability to make a reasonable estimate 
however  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue and non advertising cost of revenue for any period because of differences between the actual failure rate per an operator s statement and our internal records 
for the year ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by the monthly statements received from the mobile network operators 
e commerce revenues are earned primarily from sales of consumer products through sohu s website 
we rely on beijing sohu and sohu internet to conduct our e commerce business to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit wholly foreign owned enterprises from providing e commerce services 
prior to may   we made direct sales to customers the bc model 
on may   we implemented an additional business model the nn model mainly for health care products  cosmetics  gifts  apparel and accessories 
under the bc model  we purchased products from suppliers  stocked the goods in our warehouse and  upon receiving the orders from our customers through our website  arranged for delivery to our customers 
fulfillment was provided by delivery companies or through postal services 
product sales included the right of return within days after the goods had been received if the products had quality problems and the buyer had retained the original order form 
under the bc model  we recorded product sales net of the estimated amount of returns  and to date have estimated that the amount of product returns was not significant 
under the nn model  suppliers list their products on our website and receive orders directly from customers through the website 
the suppliers have the right to set the prices for their products 
we engage third party delivery companies to deliver products to and collect payment from customers 
under the nn model  we earn a commission ranging from to of the transaction amount 
our management must determine whether to record revenue for our wireless and e commerce business lines using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  principally whether sohu is acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether sohu is acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent sohu is acting as a principal in a transaction  sohu reports as revenue the payments received on a gross basis and reports as costs of revenue the amounts attributable to goods and services provided by mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent sohu is acting as an agent in a transaction  sohu reports on a net basis reporting as revenue the payments received less commissions and other payments to third parties 
the determination of whether sohu is serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement 

table of contents based on our assessment  the majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis 
we have primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
the content and nature of the wireless services are designed and developed by us either independently or with third parties and originate from our websites  our links located on third parties websites  or one of our dedicated phone numbers 
the mobile network operators that we contract with to deliver these services to the end customers are not involved in the design or development of the services that are provided by us 
the end customer purchases the wireless content  community access or value added services  such as news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tone and logo downloads that sohu provides 
the end customer receives identical services from us regardless of which mobile network operator is used to deliver the message 
in addition  we provide customer services to the end customers directly and we could be requested by the mobile operators to assume the credit risk if the operators are not able to collect fees from the end customers 
sohu has determined that in addition to the indicators of gross reporting  there are also certain indicators of net reporting  including the fact that the mobile network operators set maximum prices that sohu can charge and that the mobile network operators also have the right to set requirements and procedures associated with using their platform 
however  sohu has determined that the gross revenue reporting indicators are stronger  because sohu is the primary obligor  adds value to the products  has inventory risk related to content and products  and has reasonable pricing latitude 
e commerce revenues generated under the bc model are recorded on a gross basis where sohu is the primary obligor  where sohu has general and physical inventory risk and where we can set prices without any involvement from the suppliers 
for revenues generated under the nn model  our e commerce revenues are recorded on a net basis as sohu is not the primary obligor 
instead  sohu earns an agency commission  assumes no inventory risk and cannot set prices for the products 
to the extent revenues are recorded gross  any commissions or other payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less costs and expenses flows through operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same whether sohu records the revenue on a gross or net basis 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries and vies in china is the rmb 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  normally  that is the currency of the environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash 
management s judgment is essential in determination of the functional currency by assessing various indicators  such as cash flow  sales price and market  expenses  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
assets and liabilities of the china subsidiaries and vies are translated into us dollar  our reporting currency  at exchange rate in effect at balance sheet date 
foreign currency translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are accumulated in a separate component of consolidated equity on the balance sheet 
the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment as of december  and december  was a gain of million and a loss of  respectively 
our management must make estimates for the collectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of sohu s customers or mobile network operators were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  or the mobile network operators requested that we assume additional bad debts as a result of the operators inability to collect fees from end customers  an additional allowance might be required 
as of december   the majority of our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses that would apply to united states income taxes 
as substantially all of our income is earned in china  and we do not intend in the foreseeable future to repatriate this income to the united states where it would be taxable  it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses will not be realized 
the remaining deferred tax assets are related to china based subsidiaries and vies  resulting from net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax base 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the balance will not be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 

table of contents our long lived assets include goodwill  intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying value 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we did not believe that any event or change of circumstances had occurred that would result in material impairment losses in goodwill 
in respect of our intangible assets  which mainly comprise domain names  trademarks and customer lists  we amortize the costs over their expected future economic lives 
fixed assets comprise computer equipment  office furniture and equipment  vehicles and leasehold improvement  and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets on a straight line basis 
other assets mainly include the offering costs of the zero coupon convertible senior notes  computer software purchased from unrelated third parties and license fees 
we amortize the offering costs of the zero coupon convertible senior notes over a period of four years  computer software over estimated useful lives and license fees over the term of the contracts 
management judgment is required in the assessment of the economic lives of the intangible assets and useful lives of the fixed assets and other assets 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
an impairment charge would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of intangible assets  fixed assets or other assets may not be recoverable 
our estimates of future cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
as of december   we did not believe that there is any material impairment of our intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date virtually all of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange risks if the rmb fluctuates relative to the us dollar 

table of contents the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
under the managed floating exchange rate regime  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the us dollar against the rmb was adjusted to yuan per us dollar as of july   representing an appreciation of about 
the people s bank of china will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the us dollar traded against the reminbi in the inter bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day  and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the rmb on the following business day 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

the long term loans are used to finance investments in beijing sohu  which is owned by dr

sogou information  which is owned by two of our employees 
beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu and sogou information are used to facilitate our participation in telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china where foreign ownership is either prohibited or restricted 

table of contents the agreements contain provisions that  subject to prc law  i the loans can only be repaid to us by transferring the shares of beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu or sogou information to us  ii the shares of beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu or sogou information cannot be transferred without our approval  and iii we have the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu and sogou information 
dr 
zhang and the other employee borrowers have pledged all of their shares in beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu and sogou information as collateral for the loans and the loans bear no interest and are due on demand after november  in the case of high century  after june  in the case of huohu  after august   in the case of sogou information  after october  in the case of goodfeel  after november   in the case of hengda and the earlier of a demand or  in the case of beijing sohu  or  in any case  at such time as dr 
zhang or the other employee borrowers  as the case may be  is not an employee of sohu 
sohu does not intend to request repayment of the loans as long as prc regulations prohibit it from directly investing in businesses being undertaken by the vies 
because these loans can only be repaid by the borrowers transferring the shares of the various entities  our ability to ultimately realize the effective return of the amounts advanced under these loans will depend on the profitability of beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu  and sogou information  which is uncertain 
furthermore  because of uncertainties associated with the prc law  ultimate enforcement of the loan agreements in uncertain 
accordingly  we may never be able to collect these loans or exercise influence over beijing sohu  high century  hengda  goodfeel  huohu  and sogou information 
in addition  under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  issuers subject to the act are prohibited from making personal loans to their directors and executive officers 
under section  issuers are permitted to maintain the loans they made to directors and executive officers prior to the effective date of the sarbanes oxley act 
they are not permitted  however  to renew or materially modify such loans 
we believe that there is a strong argument that the loans to dr 
zhang described above are not personal loans  in view of our underlying business purpose for making the loans and the lack of a personal benefit to dr 
zhang from the loans 
in the absence of judicial interpretation  an sec rule  or an sec staff interpretation confirming our conclusion  however  we intend to treat these loans as if they were personal loans under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
accordingly  we expect that if we enter into arrangements similar to those described above in the future  any loans made under such arrangements will be made to individuals who are not our directors or executive officers 
in addition  should the existing loans to dr 
zhang  or to the entities in which he is the primary shareholder  need to be renewed or materially modified  such as if we need to advance additional funds to any of these entities  we expect that the entities  the ownership of the entities and or the loans to the entities will be restructured so that we could not be deemed to be making a loan to dr 
zhang 
the prohibitions set forth in section have not had any adverse effect on our operations to date  and we do not expect them to have any adverse effect in the future 
b investment in marketable debt securities sohu invests in marketable debt securities to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   these marketable debt securities amounted to approximately million 
these marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale because we may dispose of the securities prior to maturity and they are thus reported at the market value as of the end of the period 
as of december   an unrealized loss of  were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
interest rate risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in fixed rate debt securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
