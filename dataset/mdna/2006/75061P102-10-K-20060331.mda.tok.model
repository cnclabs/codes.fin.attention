item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
in some cases  readers can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from those stated herein 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  performance  or achievements 
for further information  refer to the section entitled factors that may affect future results in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global developer and manufacturer of rapidly deployable  multi sensor chemical detection monitors and networks for homeland security and industrial applications 
in addition  we offer a full line of portable single sensor chemical and radiation detection products 
we were founded in to develop technologies for the detection and early warning of hazardous materials 
the market for our products has evolved from being strictly focused on environmental and industrial monitoring to now encompassing public safety and the threat of terrorism 
in may  we invested million in cash for a interest in klh 
as a result  our sales into the china market increased from in to in and in in  sales from our rae systems business less sales from klh base business in the united states  europe and asia continued to grow  
table of contents primarily from the sales of our patented pid products as well as our integrated wireless technology 
sales from our base business contributed million in as compared to million in  an increase of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  valuation of deferred tax assets and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to the financial statements  significant accounting policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  the company has experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment to its distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title of all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provides for sales returns based on historical product warranty returns 
revenues related to services performed under the company s extended warranty program represent less than of net revenues in each of  and and are recognized as earned based upon contract terms  generally ratable over the term of service 
we record project installation work in china using the percentage of completion method 
installation revenue represents less than of net revenue in  and net revenues include amounts billed to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  as prescribed by the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping fees represent less than of net revenues in each of  and shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable  trade notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company grants credit to its customers after undertaking an investigation of credit risk for all significant amounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
the company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there was a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness  or if actual defaults were higher than what has been experienced historically  additional allowances would be required 
trade notes receivables are presented to the company from some of our customers in china as a payment against the outstanding trade receivables 
these notes receivables are bank guarantee promissory notes which are non interest bearing and generally mature within months 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the market  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from its suppliers 
the company has established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
when recorded  reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for specified products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves may be required 
warranty repairs the company sells the majority of its products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of shipment 
the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to sales 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage  labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its reported warranty reserve and adjusts the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
purchase obligations the company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventories and other goods and services 
the company estimated its non cancelable obligations under these agreements in    and  to be approximately     and  respectively 
all non cancelable obligations related to inventories are expected to be delivered within the next months 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its inventories and non cancelable purchase commitments by evaluating material usage requirements and forecasts and estimates inventory obsolescence  excess quantities and any expected losses on purchase commitments 
the company may record charges to write down inventory due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology  estimates of future sales volumes and market value estimates 
there was no loss accrued related to current purchase obligations 
however  any additional write downs of inventories  if any  may negatively affect gross margins in future periods 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried 
table of contents forward from our foreign entities 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

table of contents expenditures 
at december   based on our recent operating performance  we determined that we now have the ability to reasonably forecast short term operating performance on a one year look forward basis  accordingly  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefit attributable to the capitalized expenditures that become available to us in this determination represents a change in estimate during  which had the effect of reducing the valuation allowance and income tax expense  and increasing net income in by approximately  the tax expenses relating to the year ended december   consisted of a current provision of million  reduced by  primarily from a settlement with the internal revenue service of certain outstanding tax assessments originating in prior years and overpayment of the prior year tax liability

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million  as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the million reduction to operating cash flows for the year ended december  versus the prior year ended december  was due primarily to decreased profitability after adjusting for non cash items million and slower growth in liabilities million  mainly as a result of the initial incorporation of klh in our balance sheet in partially offsetting those unfavorable changes was a reduction in the growth of assets in million as a result of the initial incorporation of klh in our balance sheet in and improvements in asset management

the proceeds of that offering have been and will continue to be used for potential mergers and acquisitions  working capital and for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from product sales  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including the size  timing and structure of any future acquisitions  future capital investments  and future results of operations 
any future financing we may require may be unavailable on favorable terms  if at all 
any difficulty in obtaining additional financial resources could force us to curtail our operations or could prevent us from pursuing our growth strategy

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion analyzes our disclosure to market risk related to concentration of credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with one large united states financial institution  one large hong kong financial institution  two large shanghai financial institutions  two local beijing financial institutions  and one large danish financial institution 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit amounts and the credit worthiness of the financial institution which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid short term investments 
the impact of interest rate fluctuations was immaterial 
changes to interest rates over time may  however  reduce or increase our interest income from our short term investments 
if  for example  there is a hypothetical basis points  bps change in the interest rates in the united states  the approximate impact on our cash and short term investments would be  foreign currency exchange rate risk to date  a substantial portion of our recognized revenue has been denominated in united states dollars generated primarily from customers in the americas 
revenue generated from our european operations is primarily in euros  revenue generated by our china operations is in the local currency  the renminbi rmb and revenue generated from our hong kong based operations is in both hong kong dollars and united states dollars 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
our operations in china have been largely unaffected by currency fluctuations until the july approximately appreciation of the rmb relative to the united states dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on low cost intellectual property and efficiency in supply chain management 
in  we made a strategic investment in china with the acquisition of klh  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment 
there has been continued speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the rmb  will be subject to a further market adjustment relative to the united states dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  there is a hypothetical change in the rmb relative to the united states dollar  the approximate impact on our profits would be  were the currencies in all other countries in europe and asia where we have operations to change in unison with the rmb by a hypothetical against the us dollar the approximate impact on our profits would be a  the reduction in the total impact as against an rmb only appreciation is because some of the impact of the rmb change would be offset by changes to reported sales net of expenses in our other units as a result of changes in those countries functional currencies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars in countries other than china  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we would continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
