for all years presented 
the company uses funds from operations ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo and ffo on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
ffo on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ffo as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
for the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations 
the computation of ffo diluted includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method 
it also assumes the conversion of macwh  lp units to the extent that they are dilutive to the ffo computation see note wilmorite acquisition of the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements

on june   the company sold million of its series b preferred stock

inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease the macerich company term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  historically the majority of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
in january  the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center 
this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight lining of rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
the macerich company property costs related to the development  redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest incurred or imputed on development  redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc 
are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings years accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to june  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i origination value  which represents the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms 
value of in place leases is recorded as another asset and amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified as an other asset or liability  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases 
when the company acquires real estate properties  the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties 
the macerich company generally  the company engages a valuation firm to assist with the allocation 
asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenant s ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal 
leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the range of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs years comparison of years ended december  and revenues minimum and percentage rents increased by to million in from million in approximately million of the increase relates to the wilmorite centers  million relates to the same centers  million relates to the acquisition centers and million primarily relates to queens center and the development properties
