the acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control 
under such accounting  the financial statements of scc and minera m xico are combined on a historical cost basis for all the periods presented since they were under the indirect common control of grupo m xico during such periods 
therefore  unless otherwise noted  the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us  including our minera m xico subsidiary  on a consolidated or combined basis for all periods 
our combined financial results may not be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition of minera m xico taken place at the beginning of the periods presented and do not purport to be indicative of our future results 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see cautionary statements 
overview our business is primarily the production and sale of copper 
in the process of producing copper  a number of valuable metallurgical byproducts are recovered  such as molybdenum  zinc  silver  lead and gold  which we also produce and sell 
the sales prices for our products are largely determined by market forces outside of our control 
our management  therefore  focuses on production enhancement and cost control to improve profitability 
we believe we achieve these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices 
we discuss below several matters that our management believes are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition 
these matters include i our operating cash costs as a measure of our performance  ii metals prices  iii our recent acquisition of minera m xico  iv our business segments and v the effects of inflation and other local currency issues 
since our inception  we have principally maintained operations in peru 
however  in recent years  we have refocused our plans and began steps to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure 
in  we acquired exploration properties in chile  which are being evaluated for potential exploitation 
beginning in  we began tolling copper into rod in amarillo  texas 
the biggest step  in the new focus  however  is the acquisition of minera mexico  see minera mexico acquisition below 
operating cash costs an overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of our cash cost per pound to the cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the statement of earnings is presented under the subheading  non gaap information reconciliation  below 
we have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion  plus selling  general and administrative charges  treatment and refining charges  less byproducts revenue  depreciation  amortization and depletion  workers participation and other miscellaneous charges  the peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels  divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us 
in our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  and purchased  we credit against our costs  the revenues from the sale of byproducts  principally molybdenum  zinc and silver 
we account for this byproduct revenue because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper 
we believe that our company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
the increase over the last three years in the price of molybdenum  however  has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  we present cash costs below with and without crediting the byproduct revenues against our costs 
we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  which are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
additionally excluded from operating cash costs are inventory changes  items of a non recurring nature  and the portion of our mine stripping costs that we capitalize 
our operating cash costs per pound  as defined  are presented in the table below for the three years ended december  we present cash costs with and without the inclusion of byproduct revenues below 
dollars per pound operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased without byproduct revenue a reconciliation of our operating cash costs per pound to our gaap cost of sales is presented on page a under the subheading non gaap information reconciliation 
the reduction in the cash costs per pound of copper produced and purchased including byproduct revenue in and is to a large extent attributable to the increase in the molybdenum sales price 
the credit to the above costs for molybdenum sales amounted to per pound  per pound and per pound  in  and  respectively 
the cash cost without byproduct revenue increased in and as a result of cost increases  including the cost of petroleum products  purchased electricity  maintenance expenses and the cost of replacement parts 
in addition  the higher copper prices in and also increased our computation of cash cost  as we include in our calculation the cost of purchased metal 
the higher value and accordingly the higher cost of copper in these years  increased our cash cost by in and by a further in additionally  we believe our operating cash costs will increase in and the near term years as a result of the eitf consensus  which we adopted on january  and is described below under critical accounting policies and estimates capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable material 
if we had applied this consensus in  and our pound operating cash cost would have increased by  and  respectively 
metals prices the profitability of our operations is dependent on  and our financial performance is significantly affected by  the international market prices for the products we produce  especially for copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors  which affect each commodity to varying degrees  include international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and cost of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by producers and others and  to a lesser degree  inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes due to speculative activities 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs  metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below 
copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions minera m xico acquisition on april   we acquired minera m xico from americas mining corporation  a subsidiary of grupo m xico  our controlling stockholder 
minera m xico is the largest mining company in mexico and the eleventh largest copper producer in the world on a stand alone basis 
on april   we exchanged  newly issued shares of our common stock for the outstanding shares of minera m xico s direct majority stockholder  and minera m xico became our owned subsidiary 
as a part of this transaction  on march   we paid a special transaction dividend of million to all of our stockholders 
upon completion of the merger  grupo m xico increased its indirect beneficial ownership of our capital stock from approximately to approximately 
on october   our board of directors approved the acquisition of  shares of minera mexico from grupo mexico 
the acquired shares represent of the outstanding shares of minera mexico and were purchased for million 
we are now in the process of integrating two companies that had previously been affiliated but operated independently 
with this acquisition  we have increased our total copper reserves by  or  million tons  based on year end reserves  and have increased our annual copper production by  equivalent to  tons of copper  based on production 
business segments our company operates in a single industry  the copper industry 
with the acquisition of minera mexico in april  we determined that to effectively manage our business we needed to focus on three operating segments 
these segments are our peruvian operations  our mexican open pit operations and our mexican underground operations  known as our immsa unit 
our peruvian operations include the toquepala and cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants  industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines 
our mexican open pit operations include la caridad and cananea mine complexes  the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines 
our immsa unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  a coal and coke mine  and several industrial processing facilities for zinc  copper and silver 
segment information is included in our review of results of operations and also in note of our consolidated combined financial statements 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian nuevo sol and the mexican peso our functional currency is the us dollar 
portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
since our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru or mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso  respectively  to the dollar  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments 
in addition  the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso  resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements 
recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below 
year ended december  peru peruvian inflation rate nuevo sol dollar change in exchange rate year to year mexico mexican inflation rate peso dollar change in exchange rate year to year expansion and modernization program excluding capitalized stripping  we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we expect to make capital expenditures  of approximately million in excluding capitalized interest 
in general  the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to contribute to further vertical integration of our operations by increasing the capacity for production of refined metal products 
during and  minera m xico s capital expenditures were curtailed due to liquidity constraints imposed by minera m xico s lenders 
in late and during  minera m xico s rate of capital expenditures increased significantly 
the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in millions projects ilo smelter modernization la caridad sx ew plant toquepala crushing  conveying system for leachable material san mart n unit  santa b rbara unit  charcas unit and nueva rosita unit la caridad copper smelter  sulfuric acid plant and copper refinery toquepala concentrator expansion cananea sx ew plant new copper filter at toquepala pls dams at huanaquera total project expenditures replacement capital expenditures mexico peru total replacement expenditures total capital expenditures the above table does not include capitalized stripping of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
set forth below are descriptions of some of our current projects and expected capital expenditures 
ilo smelter modernization our largest outstanding short term capital investment project is the ilo smelter modernization 
the project is part of our environmental compliance and management program known by its spanish acronym  pama  which was approved by the peruvian government in the project will modernize the smelter and is targeted to capture no less than of sulfur dioxide emissions  in compliance with peru s environmental requirements 
the project is moving ahead on schedule with detailed engineering completed and construction work in process in order to be completed by the end of the anode casting wheel part of this project is being hot tested and starting in the first quarter of we will replace ilo blister production with anodes 
this will allow us to directly feed the refinery and eliminate the current cost of re melting blister into anode form 
the budget approved for this project is million  including million expended through december  we have budgeted million for this project in excluding capitalized interest 
toquepala leach dump project to improve cost containment and production efficiency  in we started a project at toquepala to install a crushing  conveying and spreading system at the leach dumps 
the approved budget for this project is million  with million expended through december  the new system is expected to improve recovery at our leaching facilities and will largely eliminate costly truck haulage in the process 
the project is complete at december  the primary crusher was placed in operation in august the overland conveyors  and  and the grasshoppers and were put in the production line 
the conveying reached its rated capacity of  ton hr 
in september the construction of the ramp will continue until final completion of the project  expected in august cananea sx ew plant we intend to increase our cananea unit s production of electrolytic copper by building a new sx ew plant  sxew iii 
the plant will produce electrolytic copper cathodes of astm grade or lme grade a 
the project includes the installation of storage for deliverables required for operation of the plant and the installation of an emergency power plant and a fire protection system 
the project is currently underway 
in its first stage  it is expected to produce  tons of additional copper by the end of studies for a  ton subsequent expansion of the sx ew plant are also underway 
as the cananea mine has the largest quantity of our copper reserves we are studying several possibilities for expanding it to a scale that fully maximizes its potential 
the approved budget for this project  including the subsequent  tons expansion  is million  of which million has been expended through december nueva rosita coal plant we commenced projects to increase the production at our nueva rosita unit in coahuila  mexico 
these projects include an upgrade of our pasta de conchos mine and re engineering and modernization of our coking plant 
the pasta de conchos mine s project includes the open pit development in the east and west zones to increase coal production from  to  tons per year and has a capital budget of million of which million was expended through the coking plant project includes the re engineering and modernization of ovens  with this re engineering we expect to increase efficiency in the system to control emissions during the discharging of the ovens and provide for continuous operation 
this project has a capital budget of million of which million was expended through the expected completion date of the re engineering part of this project is march the modernization is forecast to be completed in other expenditures increasing the height of dams at quebrada honda for tailings impoundment is now under engineering study 
the auxiliary dams constructed before will serve as initial dams to increase the impoundment volume at quebrada honda 
the capital cost budget for this project will be ready after completion of the engineering studies  which is expected in the third quarter the new pls dams project at huanaquera is for construction of new pregnant solution collection dams for the toquepala leaching facility 
at year end this project has reached approximately progress 
the budget for this project is million  million of which was expended as of december  in order to reduce operation and maintenance costs and comply with environmental requirements  we replaced the disc filters at the toquepala concentrator with a new vertical press filter 
the project was completed in at a cost of million 
proposed projects we have a number of projects that we believe may develop in the future 
we evaluate new projects on the basis of expected return  environmental needs  required investment and estimated production  among other considerations 
brownfield projects are development projects on existing properties  generally taking two to three years to complete 
below is a brief description of each of the brownfield projects that we believe we may pursue in the future 
information in the table below  including descriptions and investments are estimates only 
the estimated completion time for each of these projects is approximately two years  once started 
we cannot assure that it will undertake any of these projects or that the information in the table below will be accurate for any project we undertake

in addition  in december we announced our plans for a megawatt power generation plant in mexico to supply our own facilities 
we anticipate that the project  which is currently out for bids  will be built and managed by an independent power company and our obligation will be the supply of coal from our reserves and an agreement to use the power output 
we expect this plant will give us the ability to substantially reduce and control our power cost  as we will supply coal from our mines 
we believe we will be able to reduce the swings caused by the variation in the international price of energy  a major element of our operating cost 
the project  expected to be finished in  will create nearly permanent jobs   jobs during the construction stage  and will exceed mexican and international environmental standards 
we also have additional projects that we are considering and may pursue 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our combined financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon our consolidated combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these consolidated combined financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate  which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management 
areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include carrying value of the ore reserves that are the basis for future cash flows estimates and units of production depreciation and amortization calculations  revenue recognition  capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable material  and asset retirement obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ore reserves for purposes of our long term planning  our management uses metal price assumptions of per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum 
these prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term 
ore reserves based on these prices are the basis for our internal planning  including the preparation of the mine plans for our mines 
our management uses these price assumptions  as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market 
however  pursuant to sec guidance  the reserves information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years  except as otherwise stated 
we refer to these three year average metals prices as current average prices 
our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by comex  and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated according to platt s metals week 
unless otherwise stated  reserves estimates in this report use per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum  both current average prices as of december  the current average prices for copper and molybdenum were and  respectively  as of december  and and  respectively  as of december  certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices 
these items include the amount of mine stripping that is capitalized  units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping and amortization of intangible assets 
for our peruvian mines  commencing in  and for our mexican operations commencing in we have used reserve estimates based on current average metals prices as of the most recent year then ended to determine these items 
in the case of prior periods we have used reserves estimates based on a price assumption of per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum 
capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable material in carrying out our mining operations  we are required to remove waste material to access mineral deposits 
because the concentration of mineral deposits is not evenly distributed throughout the ore body  there are periods during the life of the mine in which we mine more waste as compared to ore produced  and periods during which we mine less waste as compared to ore produced 
these mining costs are commonly referred to as stripping costs 
for each of our existing mines in the production stage  our mine engineers have calculated a life of mine stripping ratio that represents our estimate of the total amount of waste to be removed at each mine divided by the estimated total proven and probable reserves at such mine 
the mine stripping ratios are used to determine the amount of mine production costs to be charged against earnings 
in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore extracted exceeds the life of mine stripping ratios  we capitalize production costs associated with mining operations in proportion to the excess waste mined 
such capitalized costs are included in net capitalized mine stripping  and are amortized to operations using the units of production method 
this charge to operations for the amortization of deferred stripping costs could differ materially between reporting periods to the extent that there were material changes in the value of proven and probable reserves 
copper resources contained in piles of leachable materials that have been extracted from the mines are not included in the determination of units of production amortization 
conversely  in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore mined is less than the life of mine stripping ratio  we reduce the net capitalized mine stripping asset proportionally with a charge to amortization expense 
during periods we are stripping at the higher rates  increased mining costs associated with the higher tonnages are incurred 
costs of this nature are necessary in a mining operation to ensure the availability of mineable ore in future periods 
the deferred stripping accounting method has been generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to mineral ore ratios  however  industry practice does vary 
at the march  meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the eitf reached a consensus that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced extracted during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
the eitf noted that the consensus does not address the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the pre production phase of a mine 
the consensus with respect to this issue was ratified by the fasb on march   and will be effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
in its june  meeting  the eitf also approved a modification to the transition provisions 
on january  we adopted this consensus by reversing million of net cumulative capitalized stripping cost and capitalized leach inventory as of december  and recording a net charge of million to retained earnings after recognition of workers participation and tax benefit of million 
in addition  near term future operating income could be negatively impacted on the extent that costs previously capitalized are expensed 
if we were to have expensed all production stripping costs and capitalized leaching costs associated with our mining operations as incurred  net operating cost would have increased by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we further discuss capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable material in notes and to our consolidated combined financial statements included herein 
asset retirement obligation our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
these estimates are based on inflation assumptions using the us consumer price index and using our risk free credit rate which is based on our credit status 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
we further discuss asset retirement obligation in note to our consolidated combined financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition for certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the molybdenum oxide proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case for sales of molybdenum products  generally ranging between one and three months subsequent to shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment 
the provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward copper prices based on lme or comex prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
in the case of molybdenum sales  for which there are no published forward prices  the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
the following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at december   and year ended december  provisionally priced sales copper millions of pounds priced at per pound molybdenum millions of pounds priced at per pound provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales were as follows at december   and year ended december  provisional sales adjustments dollars in millions copper molybdenum total management believes that the final pricing of these sales will not have a material effect on the company s financial position of results of operations

segment sales information the following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant byproducts  for each of the three years ended december  year ended december  copper sales million pounds peruvian operations mexican open pit mexican immsa unit intersegment elimination total copper sales year ended december  byproduct sales million pounds  except silver million ounces peruvian operations molybdenum contained in concentrate silver mexican open pit operations molybdenum contained in concentrate zinc refined and in concentrate silver immsa unit zinc refined and in concentrate silver intersegment elimination zinc silver total byproduct sales molybdenum contained in concentrate zinc refined and in concentrate silver results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our sales in were  million  compared with  million in  an increase of  million or 
the increase was attributable to significant increases in metal prices in  particularly for copper  which rose approximately  and molybdenum  which rose 
sales volumes for copper declined by million pounds in a decrease of compared with this decrease in copper sales volume  as well as a decrease in the volume of silver sold  was to a large part offset by increases in the volume of molybdenum and zinc sales 
the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products 
year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister concentrates sx ew rod total mine copper production was  million pounds in  a decrease of from this decrease of million pounds included a decrease of million pounds from the peruvian open pit operations and million pounds in the mexican underground mines  which were partially offset by an increase of million pounds from the mexican open pit mines 
the decrease of million pounds in the peruvian mines was the result of lower ore grades at the cuajone and toquepala mines and lower pls grade in the sx ew operation 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican underground mines was due to lower ore grades 
the increase of million pounds in production from the mexican open pit mines was principally due to higher throughput in la caridad mine and higher recovery and an increase in sx ew production due to higher quantities of pls treated and higher power efficiency 
molybdenum production increased from million pounds in to million pounds in this increase in production was mainly the result of an increase in the mexican production  due to higher recoveries 
mine zinc production amounted to million pounds in  an increase of million pounds or over the period 
the increase was due to the resumption of production at immsa s santa eulalia unit 
santa eulalia s operations were suspended from through as the facilities were being modernized 
the work at the santa eulalia mine was delayed due to liquidity issues of minera mexico in some years prior to increased production from santa eulalia amounted to million pounds 
grade decreases at our other zinc mines reduced somewhat the increased from santa eulalia 
in january an electrical fire at a power sub station at the san luis potosi zinc refinery shut down operations 
after evaluating the damage  we expect to restore of the production in the second quarter of and the remaining at the end of the third quarter 
in the interim we are selling zinc concentrates 
due to a shortage of zinc concentrate  the company is able to receive favorable terms on these sales and expect that the overall return will be favorable 
in addition  insurance coverage is expected to cover the cost of repairs  equipment replacement and any loss on production 
copper made up of net sales in compared with in sales of byproducts in totaled  million compared with million in  an increase of 
the increase is principally attributable to significantly increased sales of molybdenum  resulting from the increase in the average market price for molybdenum in compared with in addition to increased metal prices  increased mine production was also a factor in increasing our byproduct sales in  molybdenum production for was million pounds compared with million pounds in  an increase of 
the table below provides the sales of our byproducts as a percentage of our total net sales 
year ended december  byproduct sales as a percentage of total net sales molybdenum zinc silver other byproducts total cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion our cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion in was  million  compared with  in  an increase of million  or 
the principal elements of the cost of sales increase are a million increase in the cost of purchased electric power and fuel  an increase of million for mining royalties  and a million increase in worker s participation  including an adjustment of million  related to a change in the method of calculating the amount of the statutory worker s participation for the mexican worker s  see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of this matter 
in addition  the higher value of copper in increased our cost of sales by million over  as we supplemented our copper production with copper acquired from third parties 
during  in response to an industry wide shortage of mine truck tires we put in place a tire rationalization program to optimize our tire usage 
the program  which includes  road maintenance improvements  closer tire maintenance monitoring  including temperature and pressure checks  and stricter truck handling procedures  was in place for and resulted in an reduction in tire consumption when compared to while we expect the supply deficit to be resolved by mid  we continue to monitor the supply situation for this vital commodity and expect to satisfy our needs through prudent consumption practices and the development of alternative supply sources  if necessary 
we expect that cost of sales will increase in and the near future years as a result of our adoption  on january   of the eitf s  consensus related to mine stripping costs 
see critical accounting and estimates capitalized mine stripping and leachable material 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
our higher selling  general and administrative expense in was principally a result of higher legal  auditing and consulting fees related in part to the acquisition of minera mexico  to the issuance of new debt  and to the cost associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  the peruvian tax on bank transfers was million higher in depreciation  amortization and depletion our depreciation  amortization and depletion expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
the increase was principally the result of the increase in the amortization of capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable materials of million and an increase in depreciation related to replacement capital expenditures 
exploration exploration expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
the increase was principally as a result of the drilling and cross path activities at the tia maria project in peru  million  and million and million drilling costs in immsa and cananea  respectively 
interest expense interest expense in was million compared with million in  an increase of million 
our currently paid interest expense decreased in principally as a result of a reduction of our debt outstanding 
however  included in there was million for the write off of previously capitalized debt issuance cost for financings prepaid in such years 
with respect to our financing programs reference is made to liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of this matter 
capitalized interest capitalized interest in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
this increase is mainly due to the ilo smelter modernization and the toquepala crushing  conveying system for leachable material projects  on which capitalized interest increased by million and million  respectively in interest income interest income in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
our interest income increased principally as a result of higher interest rates on short term securities and significantly higher invested balances 
loss on derivative instruments loss on derivative instruments in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
in  we recorded million of loss in copper swaps and a gain of million in interest rate swaps 
in we recorded a loss of million of interest rate swap 
loss on debt prepayments loss on debt prepayments in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million 
in we paid a penalty of million for the prepayment of million of peruvian bonds and a premium of million in the yankee bonds repurchase 
in  we incurred million of prepayment fees and prepayment interest differential and million for a debt restructuring charge 
gain on disposal of property gain on disposal of property in was this amount includes gain from the sale of non core property of our mexican operation 
other expense other expense in was million  compared with million in a decrease of million 
included in other expense are fees and other costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of minera mexico and were million and million in and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million and include million and million of peruvian and mexican income taxes  million and million for us federal and state taxes for and  respectively

results of operations for the year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales our net sales in were  million  compared with  in  an increase of  million or 
the increase was principally attributed to significant increases in metals prices in  particularly those of copper  for which our average sales prices rose  and molybdenum  for which our sales prices rose 
in addition to increased metals prices  increased mine production was also an important factor in increasing our net sales in copper production for was  tons  compared with  tons in  an increase of 
the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales for each of the years ended december  and year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister concentrates sx ew rod total all four of our open pit copper mines recorded increased output in compared with the cananea mine recorded the most significant increase of  equivalent to  additional tons of copper  primarily due to a increase in mill throughput 
the toquepala mine registered the second highest production percentage increase of  contributing an additional  tons of copper 
the increase in production at the toquepala mine was primarily attributable to a higher ore grade of in compared with in the cuajone and la caridad mines also delivered higher production output with cuajone contributing an additional  tons and la caridad contributing an additional  tons in compared with cuajone s additional output was primarily as a result of higher ore grades  while la caridad s higher output was as a result of increased production despite marginally lower ore grades 
copper made up of our net sales in compared with in our sales of byproducts in totaled million  compared with million in  an increase of or 
the increase was principally attributable to significantly increased sales of molybdenum  resulting from the increase in our average sales price for molybdenum in compared with the table below provides the sales of our byproducts as a percentage of our total net sales for and year ended december  byproduct sales as a percentage of total net sales molybdenum zinc silver gold and other metals total cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion our cost of sales in was  million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
our higher cost of sales was principally due to increased production in as discussed above  copper mine production for increased with all four of our open pit copper mines registering increased output in compared with cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion also increased as a result of increases in the prices of certain inputs  including power  maintenance expenses and certain replacement parts 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion additionally increased in as a result of an increase in the volume and cost of the copper concentrate we purchased from third parties in we purchase concentrate from third parties in order to produce additional copper rods for which we receive premium pricing  as well as to meet our commitments to customers 
the cost of this purchased copper  acquired at prevailing market prices  was million in  compared with million in the increase in the cost of purchased copper resulted from the increased volume purchased and from the increase in the price of copper 
other factors contributing to the increased costs in included a provision of million for the recently enacted mining royalty charge in peru 
this mining royalty charge will be to based on sales applicable to the value of concentrates produced in the toquepala and cuajone mines 
we expect that cost of sales will increase in the near future years as a result of the recently issued emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus  which we describe above under critical accounting policies and estimates capitalized mine stripping costs and leachable material 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
our higher selling  general and administrative expense in was principally as a result of million in management fees paid to grupo m xico 
the increase in management fees payable to grupo m xico is largely attributable to the transfer of some corporate staff from minera m xico to grupo m xico

this increase was partially offset by decrease of  tons in sx ew copper production caused by lower pls grades 
the volume of sales of molybdenum and silver  the principal byproducts of our peruvian operations  also increased in we anticipate a reduction in the volume of copper production of approximately at our peruvian operations as a result of an expected decline in ore grade at our cuajone mine 
operating costs and expenses at our peruvian operations in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was a result of higher sales volume  higher cost of fuel and power  an increase in the workers participation provision  a new peruvian royalty charge and increased depreciation  amortization and depletion

the increases in and were for the most part the result of higher net earnings in both years  which were the result of improved prices for our products and for copper and molybdenum in particular 
in  our earnings were  million  approximately of the net operating cash flow 
significant non cash items deducted from  or added to  our earnings included  depreciation  amortization and depletion of million  which positively increased operating cash flow  and capitalized mine stripping and leachable material of million and a deferred tax benefit of million  which reduced operating cash flow

significant non cash items deducted from  or added to  our earnings included  depreciation  amortization and depletion of million and a deferred tax provision of million  which positively increased our operating cash flow  and capitalized mine stripping and leachable material of million which decreased our operating cash flow 
in addition  million a gain from the sale of non core mexican properties is deducted from earning to arrive at operating cash flow  the contribution of these funds is included in investing cash flows 
changes in working capital assets and liabilities increased net operating cash flow by million 
some of these working capital accounts included some rather large changes in  the growth of accounts receivable reduced operating cash flow by million  which was the result of the improvement in metal prices from the beginning of to the end 
lme and comex copper prices increased by cents and cents during  respectively  in addition the price for molybdenum increased by per pound during improving operating cash flow was the build up of payables and accruals during  largely as a result of increased worker participation and income tax provisions driven by higher earnings  payment of which carries over into the next year 
in  our earnings were million  approximately of net operating cash flow 
depreciation  amortization and depletion amounted to a million add back and capitalized mine stripping and leachable material amounted to a deduction to reach operating cash flow 
in addition  working capital changes decreased operating cash flow by million 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in we made capital expenditures in an aggregate amount of million in  including million for the ilo  peru smelter modernization project  million for the toquepala crushing  conveyor system for leachable material  million for the toquepala leach dump project and million principally for equipment replacements and upgrades  of which million was for our mexican operations 
cash flow provided by investing activities in was from the sale of marketable securities of million 
net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in we made capital expenditures of million in  including million for the ilo smelter modernization project  million for the toquepala leach dump project and million for equipment replacements and upgrades

other liquidity considerations in june  the peruvian congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies in favor of the regional governments and communities where mining resources are located 
under the new law  we are subject to a to charge  based on sales  applicable to the value of the concentrates produced at our toquepala and cuajone mines 
we made a provision of million and million in and respectively  for this new charge  which went into effect as of june  during we made payments of million related to this charge 
in addition  the constitutional tribunal stated that this charge applied to all concessions held in the mining industry 
we believe that this interpretation is incorrect and intend to protest an imposition of the royalty charge on our sx ew production  which is operating under a tax stability agreement guaranty and promotional measures for investment contract 
provisions made by the company for the royalty charge do not include approximately million of additional potential liability relating to its sx ew production from june  through december  it is anticipated that the royalty charge will have an adverse effect on our operating income and cash flow 
on january   the board of directors approved a dividend of per share  totaling million  to be paid on march  while our combined financial results show a positive cash position over the past three years  our minera m xico subsidiary  which we acquired on april   has faced challenges to its liquidity as a result of low metals prices in previous years 
these challenges resulted in its noncompliance with certain debt covenants in and in april minera m xico restructured certain of its indebtedness  entering into a common agreement among minera m xico  minera m xico s principal subsidiaries as guarantors and the holders of such indebtedness 
minera m xico paid amounts owing under this agreement with proceeds from a new credit facility established in october see financing below 
in may  the mexican supreme court rendered a decision that changed the method of computing the amount of statutory workers profit sharing required to be paid by some mexican companies  including our minera m xico subsidiary 
the supreme court s ruling in effect prohibited the application of net operating loss carryforwards in computing the income used as the base for determining the workers profit sharing amounts 
we recognized in our results of operations a charge of million for workers profit participation related to in addition  the ruling may affect our future results of operations and liquidity to the extent we pay higher workers profit sharing amounts

see note of the consolidated combined financial statements for a further description of our long term indebtedness 
on july  scc issued million notes due and million notes due the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes were used to repay outstanding indebtedness of our peruvian and mexican operations  under its million and million million outstanding credit facilities  respectively  and the balance will be used for general corporate purposes 
scc filed a registration statement on form s with respect to these notes on october  on january  the company completed an exchange offer for million  notes due and million  notes due in the exchange offer  million of the old notes due were tendered in exchange for an equivalent amount of new notes and an aggregate of million of the old notes due were tendered in exchange for an equivalent amount of new notes 
the new notes have been registered under the us securities law 
the indentures relating to the notes contain certain covenants  including limitations on liens  limitations on sale and leaseback transactions  rights of the holders of the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event  limitations on subsidiary indebtness and limitations on consolidations  mergers  sales or conveyances 
all of these limitations and restrictions are subject to a number of significant exceptions  and some of these covenants will cease to be applicable before the notes mature if the notes attain an investment grade rating 
at december   we are in compliance with these covenants 
in january  the company signed a million credit facility with a group of banks led by citibank  na proceeds of this credit facility were used to prepay million the outstanding bonds of the company s peruvian bond program 
on july   a portion of the proceeds from the july  financing  noted above  were used to repay this facility 
in  minera m xico issued million of unsecured debt  which we refer to as its yankee bonds 
the yankee bonds were offered in two series series a for million  with an interest rate of and a maturity  and series b for million  with an interest rate of and a maturity date 
during  the company repurchased million of the series a bonds 
the bonds contain a covenant requiring minera mexico to maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of not less than to  as such terms are defined by the bonds 
at december   minera mexico is in compliance with this covenant 
in  the company established a million credit facility with mitsui co 
the facility has a year term with an interest rate of japanese libo plus japanese libo for this loan was at december  
the facility is collateralized by the assignment of copper sales receivables of  tons of copper per year and requires an escrow account to fund scheduled payments 
the facility requires that we maintain a minimum stockholders equity of million and a ratio of debt to equity no greater than to  all as such terms are defined by the facility 
reduction of grupo m xico s direct or indirect voting interest in our company to less than a majority would constitute an event of default under the facility 
at december   we are in compliance with these covenants 
on october   minera mexico borrowed million pursuant to a facility with a final maturity date in the credit facility bore interest at libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from the credit facility were used to repay in full the amounts outstanding under a common agreement with holders of minera mexico s secured export notes and other financial institutions 
the loan was secured by a pledge of minera mexico s principal properties and was guaranteed by its principal subsidiaries 
in  the company prepaid the total amount of this financing  using in part proceeds from the july  note issuance 
while we recently prepaid all amounts outstanding under our peruvian bond program  we are authorized by peru s comisi n nacional supervisora de empresas y valores conasev to issue additional bonds 
we expect that we will meet our cash requirements for and beyond from internally generated funds  cash on hand and from additional external financing if required 
capital expenditure programs a discussion of our capital programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources

we have a commitment to purchase power for our peruvian operations from energ a del sur  sa until amounts indicated on the above table are based on power costs in  which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change 
pursuant to our pama we have committed to bring our operations into compliance with environmental standards established by the government of peru 
the capital purchase obligation in the above table is for the estimated cost of completing the ilo smelter modernization  our remaining obligation under our pama

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk a portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements 
based upon our indebtedness at december   a change in interest rates of percent or basis points would impact net income and cash flows by million annually 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency 
to manage the volatility related to the risk  we may enter into forward exchange contracts  currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements 
we have only had limited involvement with derivative instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged  and giving no effects to potential hedging programs metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below 
copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions we have occasionally used derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices
